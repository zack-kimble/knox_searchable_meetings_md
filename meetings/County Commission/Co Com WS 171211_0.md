| 0:00:00| Thanks for watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=0)|
| 0:00:30| We'll go ahead and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=30)|
| 0:00:37| David Shields here. Jim Morrison here. Commissioner Nastrom. Commissioner Schoenmaker here. Commissioner Wright here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=37)|
| 0:00:51| Commissioner Wright, would you like to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| Most certainly. If you would please stand, give proper courtesy to our country's flag, and join in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=54)|
| 0:01:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=62)|
| 0:01:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| Do we have a motion to approve the minutes from the prior meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=84)|
| 0:01:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=90)|
| 0:01:33| We'll have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=93)|
| 0:01:35| I forgot the exact language there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=95)|
| 0:01:38| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=98)|
| 0:01:47| We'll pick up where we left off with a topic that we discussed in the last meeting, which was mandatory firm rotation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=107)|
| 0:02:00| We had given Mr. Buch an assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=120)|
| 0:02:06| He was going to draft some language to present for us to vote on with regard to changing, I guess, the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=126)|
| 0:02:20| Currently it says that there is a mandatory firm rotation after eight years, and we wanted to amend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| So I don't know if you have an update to give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=148)|
| 0:02:31| Before that, he didn't mention it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| You can make a motion to do it with language to be approved by the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| That way you can approve whatever you want in theory, and the language will be inserted by the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=160)|
| 0:02:49| and then you'll vote on the charter to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| And then if we did a charter change, would that go on the May 1st primary because that's a county primary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=177)|
| 0:03:05| It's your audit charter, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| No, it's in the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| In the county charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| For elected officials who are in the county charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| I think it's an act of county commission that limits any board that they have to the same as themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| I think that is either a resolution or I think it's a resolution by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| And then in this body you have your own charter, and I think that's the charter that you're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=212)|
| 0:03:39| and then that would go before commission for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| That's how that would work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| That's a little bit different from my prior understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| How did you understand it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=228)|
| 0:03:50| Well, I won't name names, but somebody from the county had said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| this is something that will need to be on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| That was their understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| I don't have either charter handy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=242)|
| 0:04:07| I don't remember anything doesn't say anything about the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| Your charter doesn't say anything about the term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| I'm looking fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| It's an act by county commission, and you can request county commission to relieve your group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| because you're RFQed, not RFPed type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| I think it's a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| I don't believe it's in the charter that all committees and appointees are subject to a term limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| I think it's either an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=272)|
| 0:04:35| I think it's a resolution by commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| It's been so long since they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| They decided they wanted their appointees to be limited as themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| and I don't think that's voted on by the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| I think that's a commission act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| I'd have to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Something tells me it is not the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| But the audit committee, the audit office is in the Knox County Charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| so yours very well may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| I'm sitting here and running through it in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| I didn't see it on the RF for the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=307)|
| 0:05:12| I guess what I was looking at is time-wise, if it is on the county charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| does that then, or is it the August with the final, or is it an August vote or a November vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=318)|
| 0:05:25| That would be the general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| I think it would be the August one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| The August one then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Okay, so you still have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| I'll check into that, but I didn't know I was supposed to have that checked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| Didn't get that assignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=335)|
| 0:05:40| Well, is everybody in agreement then that we just kind of push this forward to the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Jim, are you okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Yeah, do we just want to revisit what we, did we vote on it last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| It's a left and a right move that we have Mr. Buck do the draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=357)|
| 0:06:07| So I guess we'll just move it to next month, the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| Mr. Chairman, Knox County Charter, Section 2.02, Other Powers, sub-paragraph B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=373)|
| 0:06:23| an individual certified public accountant or firm certified public accountant should be employed to perform audits for more than eight years consecutive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=383)|
| 0:06:33| with an initial four-year term, at the end of a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=393)|
| 0:06:40| So this is in Knox County Code, Knox County, Tennessee, Code of Ordinances, Part 1, the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=400)|
| 0:06:52| Speaking of the legislative branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| But it's in there as an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| Well, it's, the way I read it, it's the Charter, Knox County's Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=421)|
| 0:07:10| What's the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| It's in Article 2, Legislative Branch, Section 2.02, Other Powers, and it's sub-paragraph B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=435)|
| 0:07:28| Boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=455)|
| 0:07:40| Anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=462)|
| 0:07:45| Next item is internal audit performance evaluation, and in a nutshell, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=465)|
| 0:07:55| It's kind of a standing item on here until we get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| I still have the blank form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=481)|
| 0:08:04| Adjourn this meeting and we'll fill this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| I believe we can talk about it at the end of this, at the close of this meeting, because it's not an item that we're going to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=490)|
| 0:08:19| It's just an item we need to talk about, discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| Oh, well, it may be on the performance appraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| Is it on the agenda to be discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Well, we'll talk about that at the end amongst ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| I've got a blank form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| We can at least get the correct name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| That would be a start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| So, Andrea, do you want to give us your report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=541)|
| 0:09:02| We have been plugging away on our projects, and we had on the hotline we have four open cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=542)|
| 0:09:11| Those are the same four from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| We had two new ones come in that we've already closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| We've worked those and closed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| One of the open cases is dealing with one of the audits we're doing, so that one will stay open until the audit's complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| The other three are being actively worked right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| As far as current projects, we have health care inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| I have the exit conference this week, so our draft report should go out by December 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Forensic center fees, Brooke is working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| Draft report's expected by January 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| That probably could have been sooner, but with the holidays, we pushed it out a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| because we didn't know about schedules of the people we would need to meet with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| River sports outfitters, I would expect that draft report in mid-January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=592)|
| 0:09:57| With the PPU one to follow that by the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| We have two audits, the nutrition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| We expect to finish planning on 12-20 for those, and then we'll set the milestones once we have the plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| Susan and I have talked about the field workload, and then we'll have the rest of our milestones at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=613)|
| 0:10:22| Upcoming projects, it's pretty much the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| Until we get these other ones finished, the other ones are in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=625)|
| 0:10:29| The main thing that I have to do coming up, besides finish my audits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| is our policies and procedures review because the Yellow Book is updating in December of 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=633)|
| 0:10:41| So we need to revise our policies and procedures and make sure we're in line with the new guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| I've looked it over, and there's some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| I don't think it will be a huge impact on our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| but we will have to go in and update our policies and procedures and make sure we're in line with those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Our process follows those standards so that when our peer review gets scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| we know that we're following the correct set of standards, the most recent set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=662)|
| 0:11:12| On the health code inspections audit, the draft report dates right around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=672)|
| 0:11:19| So with that, you've got a good understanding of how that one went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| and whether the significance of the findings and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| So without getting into any of that, just keep that in mind on this next one for tattoo parlors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=690)|
| 0:11:38| as to whether or not you still think that that one's worthwhile or maybe based on the results of this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=698)|
| 0:11:44| we might want to go a different direction, look at a different project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Originally, when I did the entrance memo, the scheduling memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=708)|
| 0:11:54| we had wanted to do all of the pools, hotels, tattoo parlors, and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=714)|
| 0:12:00| because the state doesn't look at these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| So compliance with the state code is not being checked by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| They're not auditing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| So we wanted to go in and make sure that we were in compliance with state program standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| and that we were doing everything appropriately to ensure the safety for those establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| We can push that, but I'm not tied to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| It's just what's been on the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| The health code, the food establishments is definitely the biggest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| It has the most establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| I think it's between 1,600 and 1,900 establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| It includes normal restaurants you would go to, public schools, private schools, daycares,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and any place that's considered like a bar, an auxiliary place that might serve pre-prepared food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| concession stands, things like that, mobile units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| So it's quite comprehensive, that project is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| So I think that's the big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| Out of all of the things that we're looking at, that has the most items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| And that's the current one, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| That's the current one, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| Yeah, everything else I think is a much smaller universe of items to choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| Gotcha, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| And let's just kind of revisit staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| So you've got Brooke, Susan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| We have a new auditor, Zach, who started in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| He's been wonderful, and we're very excited to have him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| He comes to us with compliance investigation experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| He also has an MBA and law degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| So that's an extra resource for us, having that dual MBA and law degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| We have posted our internal audit IT position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| We posted it, and we closed it, and we did not get applicants that met our minimum qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| I just talked to Glenda this morning, and we're going to repost it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| I just have to go approve the reposting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| I'm going to put it out for four weeks and make sure we do advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| And I'm going to talk to her about how do we advertise with, like, the IIA and AGA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| and other professional organizations that could pull qualified candidates into being interested into the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=858)|
| 0:14:27| And I know you had mentioned that we may have trouble getting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| I'm not the least bit surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Yeah, we posted it, and we did it so that we would have enough time to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| and hopefully get somebody in January 1st because that's when our budget money comes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| We didn't have an applicant that met the minimum standards of the posting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=883)|
| 0:14:52| What we asked for was kind of our basic college degree in business or computer science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| information technology, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| And then we wanted at least four years of experience in IT audit or network operations, network security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| something that would give you a well-rounded view of information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| So we did not get those qualifications in the applicant pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=912)|
| 0:15:18| So we're going to repost it, and we're going to go for a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| and see if we have some options on advertising it a little more thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| Does the salary range get posted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| It does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| We have a range we usually put depending on experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| We usually put DOE in the listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| So we have a set amount in the budget that we can go up to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| and we had to write the position description because this position didn't exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| so we had to go through all of the process to make sure we had the position description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| and I made sure we had a range that allowed us some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| So if we had someone with eight years of experience, we could pay them at the top level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| If we had someone with less experience, we had some negotiating room to be on par| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| with what a similar job with that experience level would be offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| So we definitely want to be able to capture the salary for someone, which I've looked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| and it seems pretty much in line with local IT positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| So I'm pleased about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| I think we're going to be competitive salary-wise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=987)|
| 0:16:35| Anything, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Questions or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Back to the food services audit, give me the overview of your scope again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| It is looking at compliance with state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| and state health department rules on testing food service establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1010)|
| 0:16:59| Because Knox County is considered a metro, there's 11 metros,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| the state has actually contracted out to Knox County to perform this service on their behalf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| and part of the contract requirements are that we meet all of the state program standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| so we pulled the law and the state program standards down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| and we're comparing what the health department is actually doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| the documentation they're keeping, all the various, I mean, there's pages upon pages of rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1039)|
| 0:17:28| and making sure that they're in line with those rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| they're in compliance with those rules, and they're following them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Can you give me a few examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| For instance, inspections have to be assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| so each establishment has to be assigned a risk category based on the type of establishment they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| or based on previous inspection results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1069)|
| 0:17:52| That results in how often they're inspected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| Violations, they have a standard form they use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| and they have violations which are considered core violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| They're kind of the things that would lead to foodborne illness more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| And then they have other kind of best practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| and so they have that form, they give it to, after the inspection they provide it to the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| they're supposed to post it, and then if they have a core violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| they have to follow up in a certain number of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| so we're looking to see if they're following up in a certain number of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| if the risk category matches what the state says the risk category should be for a similar establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1105)|
| 0:18:34| or if they file a new permit, an inspection is supposed to be done within so many days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| is that inspection being done, is all the permitting being done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| or is the money being received and reported to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| or if things aren't being done, is there notes in the file about why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| the process they're following to complete the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| does the file have adequate documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| are fees correctly calculated, are penalties applied correctly to establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| so it's kind of a gamut of anything from permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1146)|
| 0:19:11| there's a whole lot of permitting rules and then inspection rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| those are kind of the two main categories that we looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| different types of permits and then inspection frequency and results,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| and are violations being handled appropriately in the right time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1162)|
| 0:19:27| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| Anything from you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| Just a quick question, what is Zach's last name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1175)|
| 0:19:38| Fullerton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay, and then when you get back to your office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| you may want to look at the county website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| because when you go to the homepage and you click on the hotline, it pops up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1184)|
| 0:19:52| but when you click on internal audit, because I was trying to find Zach's last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| it flips to the human resources page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| We will check into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| I know it was on our to-do list to get our website updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| but I will look at the link and make sure that it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| So the next item on the agenda is other business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| and we do have another business item to talk about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| And if you remember in the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| we were going over some things that are in our audit charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| that I didn't really feel like we had been covering in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| and one of those items has to do with enterprise risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| So Mark Jones is here, and he's going to give us a little bit of an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| Just before he comes up, I'm going to read what this item is in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| just so everybody knows where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| But there's a bullet in the charter under other responsibilities that reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| discuss with management the county's major policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| with respect to risk assessment and risk management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| To me that's different from audit risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| I think there was a little confusion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| But anyhow, Mark, do you want to come on up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1279)|
| 0:21:33| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I didn't exactly prepare a report because I wasn't sure kind of what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| I did look at the charter to kind of reference what you were going to ask about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| I can tell you what risk management currently does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| and the programs we're involved in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| I don't know if that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Is that what you would like for me to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| My interpretation of the charter is at a very high level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| I think this committee should have at least a basic understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| of what the county's risk management function is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| maybe what the largest risks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| and kind of what actions are in place or being taken to mitigate that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| Let me just go one step further with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1346)|
| 0:22:28| Here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1348)|
| 0:22:30| I think if anybody were to come to us, well, Jim and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| but maybe not these guys, and just say, hey, you're on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| What are the county's top three risks and what are you guys doing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| I couldn't give them number one, two, or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| So I think when I read this and based on my other work experience and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| I think that we need to have at least a general working knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| of just what the ERM process is and what these biggest risks are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| the what keeps you awake at night type things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| The first one is the easiest one, and that's the vehicle policy that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| The vehicles on the road for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| I think anyone that's looked at our risk would know that that's our biggest risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| What we've done in the last seven years now, we have revised the vehicle policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1404)|
| 0:23:36| It was introduced last January or February of 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| It was worked on by Charlie Sturkey and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| We spent a whole lot of time going over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I think Mr. Armstrong has reviewed various parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| and we've had quite a few discussions about how to manage the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| when we put a driver on the road and when we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| So that's a pretty comprehensive policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| In writing that policy, what I did and how I went about it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| I looked at all the different policies around the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| for municipalities and state government and kind of insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| We also looked at some, I know one of the big things we used was the insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| There was an insurance model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| I believe it was traveler's insurance on how they asked their insured to manage their fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1468)|
| 0:24:37| So all that drawn together, we put together a policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| and then Mr. Sturkey and I would work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| We've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| It passed commission, I think, maybe last December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| but it went into effect last January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| It also has a section in there on commercial drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| and a lot of people don't know it, but the county has almost 100 commercial drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| The Department of Transportation has kind of strict rules for people with CDL license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| So we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| The policy, it's called the Knoxville Fleet Safety Policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| and it does not apply to the schools, and it does not apply to the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| but the rest of the county is incorporated in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| The schools do, we do, we have a pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1532)|
| 0:25:38| The Department of DOT says that you have to randomly test CDL drivers for drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1538)|
| 0:25:44| and the school CDL drivers are actually in our pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| They asked us last year if we would include them, so they're in the pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| So we randomly test them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| That's something we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| We also run the motor vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Before you can drive a car for the county, you have to have your driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| We run a vehicle check on your driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1568)|
| 0:26:13| It's really kind of set out in that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1573)|
| 0:26:19| Probably the second most important thing we do in risk management is the safety, the safety program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1579)|
| 0:26:28| Basically, we have one safety manager, and he and I work together on different problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1588)|
| 0:26:35| but he basically does the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| He does the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| We want to make sure we comply with TOSHA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| That's the Tennessee part of OSHA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| There's a lot of rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| There's really a lot involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| You need specifics, I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1614)|
| 0:27:01| Then we have three other areas we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Workers' comp, which we do in partnership with the law department, Mr. Armstrong's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1624)|
| 0:27:13| He has an attorney assigned, and we work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| We have a coordinator in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| We have a coordinator in the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| and then we have a coordinator in the mayor's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| that kind of facilitates the claims for the workers' comp division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1646)|
| 0:27:33| As far as I know, Mr. Armstrong might tell me if I'm wrong here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| but I believe it's the only program in county government that everything is under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| I believe we handle more than 10,000 lives in that program, and that's everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1664)|
| 0:27:52| That's all the schools, every county employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| That's something that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Last year included the schools in this program, and it's saved the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1680)|
| 0:28:08| We documented this year that it saved the county more than a half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| on how the schools had bought their insurance in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| We were able to do that with just adding one other employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| so there's three employees that actually work in that division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| That's part of risk management, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1707)|
| 0:28:30| The attorney in that department who actually works for Mr. Armstrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| but he also works with me, so we work very closely on making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| that all the claims are handled properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| The insurance purchases for the county, that's another important part that risk management does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| We purchase all the property insurance for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| and we actually also purchase the city's insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| and we have about more than $1.4 billion worth of property insurance insured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1742)|
| 0:29:10| We have a broker that actually buys that for us, but we work closely with that broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1750)|
| 0:29:16| Including in that, we also all the elected official bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1756)|
| 0:29:23| Every four years, we buy bonds for elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| which are statutory under the state law, so we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1767)|
| 0:29:34| There's other specific things, like the health department has a general liability policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| We're involved in purchasing that, and then their physicians also have a malpractice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| which is a little different, so we're involved in purchasing that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1785)|
| 0:29:52| I think probably the fifth thing that we do in risk management is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| I don't think it's a risk, but it is something that takes up quite a bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| We process the claims against the county, and we do that, particularly involving vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1804)|
| 0:30:13| but also other claims, like from the parks and rec department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| or injuries on the school playgrounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| Before a lawsuit is filed, we usually investigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| We work with the law department's investigator, who also works with us to help us investigate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1830)|
| 0:30:38| We do that, and if we can, if we have clear liabilities, sometimes we will settle those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| Sometimes we can't settle them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| Again, very close cooperation with the law department in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1846)|
| 0:30:57| That's a general overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| I don't know if that's what you're looking for, but that's pretty much what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| I have just a couple high-level follow-up questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| When you come onto this committee and you're an outsider, a Gemini,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| there's no orientation or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| If you don't ask, you don't know, so that's why I'm going to ask some stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1881)|
| 0:31:28| A lot of companies, if you'll go out on their websites and stuff like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| and you look at their risk management areas, you can find a lot of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| They'll have a lot of things where they'll identify risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| and then they'll do some calculations based on probability, impact, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and then they're looking for the ones that are the highest risk and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1906)|
| 0:31:51| Does the county do any stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Absolutely, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| Technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| For instance, on the workers' comp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| before we got involved with the school taking over the non-certified employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| and the certified employees, which is about 7,000 lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1928)|
| 0:32:12| we did a really analysis of whether or not that would be worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1932)|
| 0:32:19| or whether we could hedge the risk in going ahead and assuming that liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1939)|
| 0:32:26| as opposed to providing full insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| We work very closely with the broker in analyzing the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| for whether or not we buy insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| I don't know if we're quite as technical as some companies, but we do analyze risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1962)|
| 0:32:48| A great example is a simple example, but it costs the county a lot of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1968)|
| 0:32:55| is when we have in the summer in our parks and our highway department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| working along the roads, we always have some type of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| some kind of we either hit a cable or we throw a rock and hit a Mercedes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| We're just working on a currently, maybe settling it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| but a rock back in July hit a really rare Cadillac,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| and it damaged and just put a dent in the headlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| So we find out, I mean, that's going to cost the county $5,000 because it's rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| and we've worked that claim since July trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| how you have to pay $5,000 for a headlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| But it was a really rare vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| So when we have those things, it's pretty common for me to speak with either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| Doug Patel or Dwight Vandervate and let them know, hey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| you guys need to slow down or you need to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| have cones out on the roads where you're mowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| or you need to go by and so hitting the KUB cable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| you guys need to go out through there and check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| So we try to mitigate risk that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| Another great example of mitigating risk is in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| I'm very big involved in the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| and the claims for the schools on the playground seems to be always an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| where there's a lot of injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2062)|
| 0:34:24| So Randy Smith is our risk manager for the schools, and he and I work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2064)|
| 0:34:31| But, I mean, I can't tell you how many times we've changed playground equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| One year there was a problem with the mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| The mulch wasn't being safety tested properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Basically the schools had to take all the mulch up and put a product down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| that was a safe kind of mulch, that had been certified safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| So those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| The reason we found out about that is we had, I think in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| this had been a couple years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| a kid actually stepped on a piece of the mulch and it went through his shoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and went into his foot and had to have some medical attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| We started checking on that, and that's how we found those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| But there's many situations with the equipment on playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| and we've worked hard to try to get the schools to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| when they put the, there needs to be someone certified on playground equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| and the playground equipment has to be certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| So actually the schools have cooperated, and we kind of had a plan on how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| But that's the kind of risk mitigation that we've looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| Oftentimes it's hard to fully mitigate risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| There's always a cost-benefit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Is there anything going on right now that you're aware of that concerns you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| that you don't feel like has been properly addressed or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| I've got this feeling we can always do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| and the people that work with me, we're always trying to look for better ways to do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| Randy Smith is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Ron Benge, who's the safety guy, is always asking questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| or talking about how things are being done out in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| So we're always looking for better ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| But I get great support from the county when we need something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| Mr. Caldwell is, I mean, another thing that we just put into, I forget, I mean you bring things up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| there's always a problem with trees on borders of county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| And time after time after time, these trees will blow down on somebody's house or on somebody's car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2207)|
| 0:36:54| And the county can or cannot, we sometimes are liable and sometimes we're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| but we've got a fund now where when any of the employees for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| the public works employees or the parks people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| spot a tree that's looking like it might need some checking on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2227)|
| 0:37:12| then we send out, Ron or Randy or I, we all go look at the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| And then we've got a contract with a tree company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and we have a fund that we can go ahead and take care of that tree before something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| So we think that's a really good program as another example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| We've just started doing that in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| But no, to answer your question, I think we get good support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| I can tell you another thing we're getting ready to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| and with Mr. Armstrong has been involved in this too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| we are looking at all of the HIPAA privacy issues throughout the county now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2265)|
| 0:37:55| That's a pretty significant risk, so we're working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| So that's another area that we're involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| Some of that goes over to the human resources side of what I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| but some of it's really, and I think the law department's identified that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| as a significant risk to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| So we're really working on trying to reduce risk of HIPAA violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| privacy issues in the way we do our IT, our software.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2300)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2309)|
| 0:38:30| One thing I wanted to mention is I think their department has done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| of being very innovative at looking at how they can save the county tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| And, in fact, one item that will appear on the agenda of the county commission today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| is a result of Randy Smith looking at issuing a certificate of insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2324)|
| 0:38:50| instead of a bond for our elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| So going forward, if it does pass, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| we would issue a certificate of insurance to all elected officials that require one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| except for the trustee and the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| But it's innovative ideas like that that saves the county money down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| So they've been very proactive in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Well, a couple of other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| That's true, and the state statute would allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| That was passed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| But we also have combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| We have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| We use one broker for all of our insurance, and we bid that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| And I think that's been the school system uses the broker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| We purchase quite a bit of insurance for the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| So we have a very cooperative relationship there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| But that broker also was, Randy had worked with that broker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| with coming up with that plan of just buying a policy as opposed to all of the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2390)|
| 0:39:59| And that will be, that's kind of ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| It would be, the bonds are up next September 1st for the elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2402)|
| 0:40:08| when new officials are elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| So the county spends about $65,000 a year on those bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| Or not a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Well, actually, it's a pro-election season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Some of them are yearly, and some of them aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| But it's a relief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| That is true, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| That's a really positive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2426)|
| 0:40:31| Anybody have any questions about risk management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Dave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| I would have supposed or guessed that vehicles on the road were a major concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2442)|
| 0:40:50| Then you discounted the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I was thinking about the Sheriff's Department and the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| Do they have comparable policies to what the rest of Knox County works under?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2457)|
| 0:41:05| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I know when we did, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| I do know that I tried, the first version of the vehicle policy had the schools included in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| And the administration over there said that they were fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| They didn't need us to be involved in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| It just made sense to me at the time to include everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| And now we are doing the commercial drivers for the drug testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| But that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| It would have been just as easy and cost effective to do the whole county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| I think most departments would say we've been fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| We're pretty strict, as Mr. Armstrong will tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| Running those motor vehicle record checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| making sure that if you drive your own car on county business that you have a certain amount of insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| and you have to provide that documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| I guess we've taken off quite a few people that would have driven if we hadn't had this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2520)|
| 0:42:09| I think that reduces the risk tremendously when we make sure that we're checking everybody to make sure we have qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| I haven't talked about the training, but we have a pretty good training program for safety in vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2536)|
| 0:42:25| You have to take an online driving class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And if you get in trouble, you might have to take an in-person class in driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| And I know there are people that have left the employee of Knox County based on their inability to perform in a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2555)|
| 0:42:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| Thank you, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| I got a phone call a couple weeks back from a county employee that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| hey, your January date is no good for the next meeting, but we need to pick a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2578)|
| 0:43:08| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| It was the day after Martin Luther King Day, wasn't it, on a Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2595)|
| 0:43:16| It wasn't that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| I think somebody else had the room or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| I think there was a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| Do you know why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| It could be city council then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| That's on a Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| The county has to kick it up a notch and get out of here for the city on Christmas issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| That's what it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| I don't know, but we do have to be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| What was Drusilla that called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| And she said, hey, there's a conflict that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| It's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| You'll need to pick another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Yeah, so she had asked that I bring it up at this meeting to pick a new date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2628)|
| 0:44:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| You want to do it the next day, the Wednesday, the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| Originally, we were scheduled for the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| That's Martin Luther King Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| No, 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| That's on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| Tuesday the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| No, Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| I know, but for that reason, it's on the 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| That's why we do Tuesdays, because of Martin Luther King Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| And so is work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2669)|
| 0:44:39| How long does it take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Okay, yeah, that'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Is finance committee during commission day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| It's always on commission day, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| We've been doing work session day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Yeah, we do finance committee that day at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2692)|
| 0:44:57| So I don't know, unless we were going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| She's running out to ask real quick what the conflict was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2705)|
| 0:45:14| That's one of these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| I want to see if I got it written down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| Yeah, we were scheduled for January 16th at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| For some reason, commission has their work topic, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| Well, that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Ah, that's right, because it's city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| It's right after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| They have theirs at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| We were going to do about a 20-minute meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| You'd have to hone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Earlier in the day, if the room's open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| For noon, 10 or 9 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| Or go the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| I mean, for the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| I mean, there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| They had a commission at a 2 o'clock meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Well, I think they figured out that the commissioners had another meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| that day at 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| So we were only going to have 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| So is there another time slot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| I mean, do you guys want to do a Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Or is there something that, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| Just beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| And if there's a problem on the 16th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| we probably have to have a finance committee at 3 o'clock then or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| So that would run into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| We probably have retirement and pension board at one 30 that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| What about, what about Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| The following Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| Is that the 22nd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2808)|
| 0:46:50| That's the retirement pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2810)|
| 0:46:53| And that's at one 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| Tom would be gone for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| And Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| And Hugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| Nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| We can get something past 3 nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| Got a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2830)|

| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2934)|

| 0:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2937)|
| 0:49:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| Available both days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| So which day would you prefer, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| So January 17, 1.30 to 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| I thought you said start at 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| 1.30 is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2964)|
| 0:49:24| 1.30 to 3.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| Anybody else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| So we'll expect at that meeting to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| you both on the school activity as well as the CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| Both of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| Just very briefly, from an audit report presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| Ted Hodes, of course, with Pew CPAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| I'm assuming the January meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| the focus will be on talking about the results of the Knotts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| County audit, the CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| The internal school funds, myself and Garrett Radin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| of the schools are going to present that to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| board on either January 8 or January 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| And we will go through that in great detail at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| That's the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| So probably the school's report will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| be as detailed in this session this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3028)|
| 0:50:32| as opposed to prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| But it will be the intent is that it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| going to be dissected thoroughly with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| I'll answer whatever questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| So we can go over it in as much detail as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| But I'm just saying, we are going to go through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| with the school board first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Yeah, just to make sure with us, you go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| any significant findings, repeat findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| Yes, I will summarize those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| But it's up to you as far as priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| I would assume that the Knotts County presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| will be the first priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3067)|
| 0:51:08| Whatever time's left over to go over the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Yeah, that'll be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Thank you, Ted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3078)|
| 0:51:19| If there's nothing else, we'll adjourn this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3079)|
| 0:51:27| I call to order this December meeting of the Knotts County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| work session, commission work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3089)|

| 0:52:15| OK, let's start with amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| I have four items to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3140)|

| 0:52:37| that we talked about at our legislative luncheon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| the LCUB payment in lieu of tax and the DUI bill, DUI law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3160)|
| 0:52:49| and a discussion on emails that come to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3169)|
| 0:52:55| We have two withdrawals at request of the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Those are number 41 and 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3179)|

| 0:53:12| I have two items for deferral to January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| It's number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| That's R17-12-201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| And the other one is a zoning matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| that I received a text today from someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| And that was to defer to January item number 66, 11-G-17-RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3210)|
| 0:53:42| And I have the following items to be heard and not on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3222)|

| 0:54:17| 54, and 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Do any of my fellow commissioners have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| Commissioner Nostrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| I'd like to take item 40 off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| I'd also like to take item 38 off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| for a quick clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3287)|

| 0:54:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3296)|
| 0:54:57| I just wanted to show on page seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| that the commission office has now revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| the way we do our agenda, where you can see where withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| is now actually right below the resolution number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| So it makes it much easier now to identify those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| So I think Drew did an outstanding job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| in getting that worked out for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| Seeing no lights on, do I have a motion to set the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3326)|

| 0:56:08| I want to make a motion that we move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3371)|
| 0:56:12| I want to make a motion that we move this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3372)|

| 0:56:43| to serve on the Marina Use Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| OK, I believe if I get some help from Jill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| I believe the two that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| serving the terms this refers to are Thomas and Schoomaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| Do both of you all wish to continue in this role?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| OK, if there's no objection from the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| my fellow commissioners, I'd like to just add their names in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| Seeing none, Madam Clerk, we'll add their names in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3440)|

| 0:58:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Dwight, there hasn't been an amendment to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| if you would like to address that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| Dwight Vanderbeek, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| I just wanted to mention, we would propose in the verbiage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| to, in the sentence that reads, the most recent addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3521)|

| 0:58:47| guidance standard specifications for road and bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| construction as the official standard of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| for the design and construction of any road or bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| constructed or accepted by Knox County, period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| and drop for any joint permanent easement serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| six lots or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3541)|
| 0:59:01| Those are really more Planning Commission considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| the JPEs, and they're not considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| for our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| So we thought it's better just to stop at public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| accepted by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| I need a motion, I guess, to pass the amended version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| I will make the motion, or I'll amend my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| to make it with the amended version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3563)|
| 0:59:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| Commissioner Bustler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I was wondering, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| I was wondering on this, whereas as going to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| Metropolitan Planning Commission minimum road standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| regulations providing guidance for local roads only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| what do you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| Roads that are considered classified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Commissioner Bustler, without getting too far down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| into the weeds, the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| addresses only those that are considered classified roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| Those will be major and minor arterials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| major and minor collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| And there is one that I am forgetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| A local street, for instance, a subdivision street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| those standards are codified in the minimum subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| regulations that are locally published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| And TDOT doesn't offer any guidance there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| So we rely on the guidance that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| provided by the minimum subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| And so that's why we draw a distinction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3624)|
| 1:00:27| OK, so when these roads are turned over to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3627)|
| 1:00:33| for us to maintain after subdivision is completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| do we have to do anything of raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| the standards of those roads if they're less than what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3642)|
| 1:00:43| The minimum subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| will contain the necessary elements as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| there's two considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3649)|

| 1:00:52| the road aligns, horizontal cars, vertical cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3655)|
| 1:00:55| Those are all appropriately covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| in the minimum subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| And there's also standards for construction, excavation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| base stone, binder course, carbon gutter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| final surface of asphalt. Those are also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| all covered in the minimum subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| to our satisfaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3673)|

| 1:02:15| that we received right after the agreement was uploaded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3735)|

| 1:03:40| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| Hi, go ahead and approach, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| State your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Rebecca Gibson, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| First, I want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| I think this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| I'm glad to see that we're investing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| in permanent supportive housing for the veterans community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3834)|
| 1:03:58| And I seem to recall that this was something we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| approved last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| And this is more of just an amendment to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| Also, looking at the timeline, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| looks like we're getting ready to knock things down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| and get things rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| But I guess my only simple question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| when I saw this come back up was, with this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| without actually going back and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| at the one we did last year, what exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| has changed from this and last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| And how come we needed to get the updated amendment to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| Basically, what happened in the HUD world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| within one year of allocating funds to a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| it needs to get rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| What happened is when Helm Ross put this out for bid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| the construction costs came in quite a bit higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| than they anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| So they had to go find additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| in addition to the original funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| they had retained for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| So basically, they had to have time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| but it was running into the HUD one year time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3887)|
| 1:04:50| So we put some tight ramifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| in their guidelines in there for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3893)|
| 1:04:55| They have already given us the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| They've signed with the general contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| So that's completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3898)|
| 1:04:59| And demolition started today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| And what that drives into, they will do a reimbursement request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3904)|
| 1:05:04| And that will make us have costs toward the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| And that relieves the stress in the HUD world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| So it's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| And it should move forward wonderfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| But it had to do with increased construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| So really, part of it is, yeah, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| got an economy that's moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| Construction costs are going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| And it didn't match up with the original budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| And we had that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| We need to get this done in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| to make sure that the project happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| And we have to have this because we're accountable to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Because HUD does not give us money not to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| So we had to put these additional benchmarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| in there, basically, to ensure the project's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| They've done a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Basically, there's this pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| And we had to put additional things in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| to make sure the project was moving forward very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Commissioner Gale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| My question is on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| It says that the agreement between the county and Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| Housing Partnership shall remain in full force and effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| Is that home source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| Or it is Knox Housing Partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| It's at the bottom of that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Because I thought they changed their name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3962)|
| 1:06:03| You know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| That's a mistake on an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| It should be Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| And we can correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=3968)|

| 1:06:55| The resolution is to approve a grant contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| for the 2017 Homeland Security Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| pass-through funding in the amount of $349,947| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| for equipment and training for the 16 counties compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| Tennessee Homeland Security District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| I'd like to make a motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| Commissioner Nystrom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| You can go ahead and approach again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I've been just bringing up at next week's meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| when we have a bigger audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| There was just today, there was a terrorist attack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| up in New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4055)|
| 1:07:36| There was a bombing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| And as I understand, this particular grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| it's not necessarily for equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| but it's to help us put together plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| We've got 11 different districts in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| And this is for our district, District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| which is composed of 16 counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| to help you all put together plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Can you tell us, I guess, just a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| about how the money is used and the desired outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| in terms of helping add to the safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| for our regional community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| Basically, the grant falls into two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| on the Homeland Security side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4089)|
| 1:08:10| There's the equipment side, and there's the training side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| And the agencies that are funded this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| their first responder agencies are Karnes Volunteer Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Department, Knoxville Emergency Management, Knoxville Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| Department, Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| the Sheriff's Department, Knoxville Volunteer Rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| Squad, Rural Metro, and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| Now, that's on the equipment side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| But then when you talk to the planning side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| that's when we go into the training program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| And that's basically, we have a training subcommittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| that meets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| And they get together and decide what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| courses would be beneficial for first responders in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| So that's basically more on the training side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| to help first responders be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| The equipment side has been rolling for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| And there have been a lot of expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| on the equipment side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| But the training side goes more into what the needs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| And then in addition to that, we have the CCTA grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| That's another FEMA grant that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| to go into more preparedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4144)|
| 1:09:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| I guess I'll ask my fellow commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4147)|
| 1:09:09| if you'd like her to share this when we have a bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| audience next week in light of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| Not a huge, every attack is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| Is that something that you all would like to hear next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| We can just go ahead and pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| If you wanted to come back, you can make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| to pass without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Yeah, I'll go ahead and make a substitute motion to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4167)|
| 1:09:30| it without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| A second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| We have a proper motion and second before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4180)|
| 1:09:40| Opposed, say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4183)|
| 1:09:54| On page eight, item number 45 is approving a local agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| project agreement with the Tennessee Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| of Transportation for the Knox County Greenway Quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| Study, an estimated amount of $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| with 80% of funding provided by the Federal Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Transportation Block Grant, 20% provided by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| Regional Listing 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4211)|
| 1:10:19| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| Oh, let me change my motion to a motion of no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4221)|
| 1:10:28| Second approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4230)|
| 1:10:30| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Going through this, can you explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| what this grant covers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Then Knox County is going to be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| 20% of $300,000, $60,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| Where is that funding come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| Is it already being approved, or will we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| need to prove it in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4248)|
| 1:10:48| Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| We actually applied for this grant last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| so we've been working with the mayor's office and finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| on the matching, because obviously a lot of grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| So we'll set up those matching funds early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| This will be a phased approach to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| at a little more detailed plans for greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| in specific parts of the county that are real high growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Beaver Creek will be the first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| targeted because of all the growth and opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| up there, and also dovetailing with Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| on their sidewalk plans up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| So we're going to work hand-in-hand with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| What it allows us to do is get a little more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| on these plans to where, when subdivisions come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| for a review, a lot of times we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| asked to look at those for potential greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| But without a little better plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| it's hard to know if we need that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| So the funding's here, this 20%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Mr. Battelle, this is just to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| with a schematic, or a drawing, or priorities, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| This does not really address making any trails or greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| It more looks at potential routing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| of what makes sense in relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| with properties, and topography, and problem areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| So mostly, again, when we get subdivisions come through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| or new developments come through for review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| and it doesn't make sense to have a greenway there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| we'll have a little better information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| to work with developers to say, yeah, it's a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| or no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| So how will decisions be made on where future projects might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4335)|
| 1:12:20| be funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| The reason I ask is in light of new Gibbs Middle School, Gibbs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| Ruehtan Park, Gibbs Elementary School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| and then there's been new highway construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| between Harbinson's Crossroads and the high school site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| There are several property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| that are currently in discussion of how could trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4360)|
| 1:12:44| be established in that area to have walkways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| and connect these different entities as just named| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| without going up on Tazewell Pike, the state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| and having a sidewalk right beside traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| moving at some velocity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| The plans for projects upcoming, how will that be handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| and how will communities go about getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| their desires or their needs input into the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| Yeah, good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| And this particular plan obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4395)|
| 1:13:17| drills down a little deeper than we have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4397)|
| 1:13:20| We'll also be looking at next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4400)|
| 1:13:25| to do an update to our park and greenway plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| that we did about seven years ago jointly with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| So about every five to seven years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| we try to update that, go back out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| ask questions, look at new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| So we hope to be working on that next year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4417)|
| 1:13:40| And another project in the East County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| there's been conversation of between East Bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| and House Mountain State Park, which the county maintains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| I just want to make sure that some of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| which I'll really call rural, not urban trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| get included in planning that they might ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| Some of the newer ideas like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| we need to pull into that long range plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4449)|

| 1:14:17| We have a motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| I believe it is to pass with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| on to full regular commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4462)|

| 1:14:46| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| Doug, this is a new used equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| and where is it going to be sent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| And we do thank US Cellular for donating the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| Yes, sir, we appreciate US Cellular keeping us in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| They had a cafeteria operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| This was some leftover equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| And they asked if we could use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| So with the new facility coming online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| with the BMX track at Southwell, we've got it stored down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| and hope to plug it in in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| Signal the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4515)|

| 1:15:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| Seeing no lights on, we have a motion before us to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4562)|

| 1:16:16| Senator Felicity Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| On page 9, item number 51 is a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| One, amending various amendments to the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| rules as shown on the attached Exhibit A. And two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| renumbering the school's resolutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| to be in the 1,000 series in order for the school's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| resolution to appear at the end of the resolution's portions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| of the agenda work session and commission agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| Resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Moved, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| Yeah, during the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| we discussed moving the school's consent calendar to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| I just want to ask, what value does it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| bring to the agenda and the flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| I mean, the school team that is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| have three other meetings during the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| and it appears for no other reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| we're just holding them here for 30, 45 minutes, maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| a couple hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| I just don't know what value it brings moving them down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| to the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| I was asked to bring this forward because of outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| people, from news media to newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| that a lot of the things they come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4651)|
| 1:17:33| are not for a school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| They get that at school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| So they're sitting here for an hour or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| That's one of the reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Other reasons is that, like tonight, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| no deferrals for the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| so it'll be a consent agenda next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| I did talk to Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| and if he's more than welcome, if he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| wants to express opinion, that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| said he understands somebody's got to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| and somebody's got to go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| So that's basically where it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| And me, personally, I like it the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| when it was brought to me to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| I like the idea so that we'll let the government go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| And then if there is an important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| we can always, if I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| suspend the rules and go to that important issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| at the school board, then go back out and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| And most of these meetings, 75% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| we never pull anything off the school's consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| And to make them sit and wait while we discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| our other items, the only time I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| it saving 75% of the time is the amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| it takes the clerk to read the consent item, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| probably be no more than five or 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4720)|
| 1:18:46| I feel for the people that work for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| they have their three meetings, and then they also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4729)|
| 1:18:53| have our work session and our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| They have families, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| I think most of the time, all we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| going to be doing is saving five, 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4740)|
| 1:19:05| I just don't see the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| Well, I think what we can do is my light's still on, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Mine never went off, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| Let him go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| I'm sorry I interrupted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Mr. Thomas, do you would like you to come up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| a few words on whether good idea or bad idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4761)|
| 1:19:26| Mr. Davis and Mr. Oaks, you're more than welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4766)|
| 1:19:30| And the gentleman there, I can't remember your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4770)|
| 1:19:34| Yeah, anyone can express opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| And the young lady there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| yes, Commissioner Day did talk with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| I do understand somebody has to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| and somebody has to go last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| But having said that, I know we have five folks here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4797)|
| 1:20:03| had two others finance folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| So sometimes it involves seven or eight people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| And the fact that we do meet three other times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| during the month and then come to these two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| not so much for my time, but I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| feel for the other folks that come and give their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| as well after having done three meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| So we'll certainly serve at your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| We'll do whatever you vote for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| But there are a lot of meetings that our folks attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| I just want to make one clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| that these rules for everyone, anything that is read is new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4835)|
| 1:20:41| or will be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| Anything that's got a line through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| will be retracted or removed from the current rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4845)|
| 1:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| What you'll see is as we go along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| most of our meetings are bumping up on zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| So now you're going to see the school board having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| to wait for zonings to hear a consent calendar read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| I think that's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| And don't just change something for the sake of changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4872)|
| 1:21:18| I just don't see the point in making that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| And so next Monday, I'll be making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| to approve the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| I'll be making a motion to approve all the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| minus that agenda item, changing that line item in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| Because I don't think it has any value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And it just costs more people more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| And I think it's unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4899)|
| 1:21:47| You're calling on me because I made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| a motion for no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| I agree in that I think I'm the only person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| in 10 years that voted no on any one item brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4917)|
| 1:22:01| by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| We've always voted to approve their stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4923)|
| 1:22:06| And as there are six of them seated here right now at 530,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4926)|
| 1:22:11| if we had moved through the agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| the Board of Education, they'd already be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| So I believe I'll not support holding them here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| till the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| Can we have a motion before us to pass on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| to the regular meeting with no recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4949)|
| 1:22:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4958)|
| 1:22:38| Item 52 is a resolution amending the public records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4958)|
| 1:22:42| policy for Knox County to designate additional public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| records requests, coordinators, and to allow requesters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| to use personal equipment to make copies of records| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| with certain restrictions, as outlined in this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| and in accordance with state law resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| Mayor Burch is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Would you like to come down and say a few words, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| I would have recognized you earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| but you keep walking in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4990)|
| 1:23:11| And I never could catch you when we were at a good break spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| We were scheduled to speak at the victim's remembrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| at 5, but they've changed it to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| And my daughter has a recital tonight at 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| so I want to make sure I get there early for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| I expect it to be a sellout crowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| and I'm hoping to get there early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| And then I have a Christmas party tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5010)|
| 1:23:34| West Knox Republican.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5014)|
| 1:23:34| Next time, let us know, and I'm sure we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| can make accommodations to move you up in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| No, you're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| I do want to welcome our new football coach here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5019)|
| 1:23:44| Tim Burch at 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| As we used to say in the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| I don't know if I'd have said that, preacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| but this is something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| This is just a culmination of some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| And I know this commission and our administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| has been focused on things like open records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| and we want to make sure that everyone has access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| Michael's talked to everybody today or in the last few days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| I think, except maybe Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| And if you all have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| we will try to answer them if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| any associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5060)|
| 1:24:26| Good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| I appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5068)|
| 1:24:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5069)|
| 1:24:29| But if there are, if you all want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5069)|
| 1:24:30| to get with us between now and next week or whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| we'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| I just want to say I'm glad that we have this more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| transparency going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| But one thing I need to ask, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| is when these records are asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| are they asked for specifically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| Is there a guidelines where they ask for these records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| or is it just, how can I say, more of a broad base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| Well, I think anybody can ask for any specific records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| The public owns them, of course, so we both agree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5106)|
| 1:25:10| So I think it's just they can get specific if they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| And I believe if they get broad with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| then it'll take a little longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| Well, the only reason why I was asking for broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| sometimes if somebody asks for a big number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| and they're tied up, how do you, how will we deal with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| I'll turn it over to Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| He knows the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| Michael Greider, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| So to answer your first question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| also we have the county public records policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| which is what we're amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| And it outlines a process that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| be used for requesting records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| As far as specificity goes, records custodians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5145)|
| 1:25:49| have the ability and some discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5149)|
| 1:25:51| to ask for a request or to be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| So if there's a very broad request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| we can ask the person requesting records to be more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| And there's a difference between a broad request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| and a large request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| So you can have a very specific request that is large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| and you just kind of do what you can to fulfill it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| Or you can have a very vague and broad request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| and you can say, it's a little bit too vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| I need you to define to me what it is you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| So that is something that's allowable under state Open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| Records Act, and it's something that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| And I like that new clean look that you've got, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| I don't like it, but thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| Mr. Chairman, may I also add something, if you don't mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Commissioner Daley had a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| that I didn't address in the memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| that I sent to you before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| And that is, what if someone comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| to a clerk's counter asking to inspect and then subsequently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| photograph records, and it takes a long time to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| The policy addresses that, Mr. Daley, the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5209)|
| 1:26:52| does, by stipulating that if there is a large request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| as long as it doesn't impede other people's access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| to government services, then if it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| then we ask them to come in and schedule a time to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5224)|
| 1:27:07| so that it doesn't interfere with how other people interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| with government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| So just to kind of be clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| I apologize for leaving that question out of the memo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Mayor Berkshire, I appreciate your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| to make Knox County government more transparent, open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| and accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| Excuse me, Michael, one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| I know you wanted to get out of here, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| so what about the charges we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| do at the clerk's desk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| So I would say that as far as charges go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| those are addressed either through our local policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| or they're addressed in other sections of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| So some of our criminal court clerks and Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| you can probably be a little bit more specific with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| Some court clerk offices have a different schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| of fees that are outlined in state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| For our purposes under the administrative branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5280)|
| 1:28:03| we have a $20 an hour fee structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| that is outlined in the policy, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| a $0.15 per page copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| So if you're making copies, then you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| charged at a $20 per hour rate less the first hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| plus $0.15 per page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| But what about the photo copies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5298)|

| 1:30:54| Madam Clerk, we're on to discussion items, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| First discussion item is to set a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| for the public hearing for the Rural Preservation Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5462)|
| 1:31:06| Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5466)|
| 1:31:07| I will assume that we're going to do this like we normally do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| and do it after our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| Next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| Next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Can somebody make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Make a motion we do it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| After our work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| We don't need to vote on that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5485)|
| 1:31:28| Yeah, we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| OK, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Opposed say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| Second item is an item I put on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| Jill brought this to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| Charter review comes up in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| And I believe Brad, Dave, and I were the only ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5506)|
| 1:31:51| that were on that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| Those two sat as sitting commissioners on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| And I was appointed by the third district commissioner, Tony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5515)|
| 1:32:01| Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| At the end of that process, we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5522)|
| 1:32:06| wanting to start to try to address something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| that we didn't have time to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| And that was the size and makeup of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| There's 27 members on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| And Jill, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| The nine district commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| they each point a citizen to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| And then the mayor appoints nine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| That's 27 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| All nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| Yeah, the old, it was because there was 19 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| And if you guys will remember, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| was some discussion of with being that many people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| people didn't feel obligated to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| So a lot of times, we pushed to have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| I don't know what the answer is as far as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| is the proper makeup of it and what commissioners would serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| But it's something we need to try to decide here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| Because in order to change that committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| we have to actually have a charter amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| go before the public at the next election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| so that we have the structure of the committee when 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5596)|
| 1:33:16| So that's in August of 18, right, the general election?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| It could be August or November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| Only August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| It's a county general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| They do it in November, but August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| is the county general election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5606)|
| 1:33:27| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| I just wanted to bring that up tonight so that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| can think about that and talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| If you find anybody that's served on it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| get their opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| I'd like for us to move this for further discussion Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| More discussion Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| So we'll bring this back up on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| Next, we have a discussion item on, I'd say, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| But I believe our legislators tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| we need to meet with them on one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| But the two items that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| are legislative launching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| The first one being LCUB payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| This is being actually brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| by the state legislature, assisting us in receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5652)|
| 1:34:18| money, payment in lieu of taxes, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| is on investment in Knox County that currently is not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| paid to entities in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| And I'd like to see us word a resolution for Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| to, smile, Jill of the jungle, a resolution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5675)|
| 1:34:41| would be something like that the Lenore City's utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| board share their pilot dollars where the investment exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5687)|
| 1:34:57| basically, as the model for the rest of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| Now, we won't have a, what do they call them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| resolutions at this day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| No, I think we should have a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| We should have a resolution, but we should basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| say that we are supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| We are supporting the state legislature and their endeavors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| to have payment in lieu of taxes applied where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| the entity has its investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| And that would be as it is within every other jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| I believe this is the only occurrence where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| the dollars are in one county and paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| to an entity in another county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| OK, so can you work with Jill to get us a resolution that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| can add to Monday's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5745)|
| 1:35:46| I can smile at the Mr. Law Director, and he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5746)|
| 1:35:50| So it will be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| Yeah, and I think that will give us a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| to actually get some more information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| I placed a call on Friday to the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| of Lenore City Utilities Board, and have not gotten a call back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| yet on a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| But I wanted to ask some follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| But because I believe, what is it, 70% of their revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5775)|
| 1:36:24| is derived from Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Because I know everything in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| is Lenore City Utilities Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5791)|
| 1:36:32| So, but do you have any additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| from Mr. Brooks, Representative Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| The number may be 60, or it may be 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| The percentages and the total number of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| are not being addressed at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| I think we're just trying to get a resolution out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| of the state of Tennessee that would be in agreement with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| These dollars may somehow, in the future, be moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| Not all at one time, but we have to move toward they're paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5823)|
| 1:37:09| where they need to be paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| We did a radio talk show on this some years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| And it came to our attention that when Lenore City Utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| Board and KUB divided up the counties they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5845)|
| 1:37:30| in East Tennessee, and KUB took Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| and Lenore City Utilities took, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| Loudoun County and parts of those counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| down in that area, McMinn County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| Well, you can see what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| I mean, obviously, Lenore City Utilities and West Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| hit a goldmine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| And it's my understanding they won't give the money back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| or they're not wanting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| They said, look, you could have done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| We're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| This is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5874)|
| 1:37:55| And that's what they've told us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| And they do a good job with the utilities in West Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| Am I right, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| No question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5885)|
| 1:38:06| I have basically zero complaints about Lenore City Utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5886)|
| 1:38:11| Board, so they do a terrific job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| They do, but I think what the issue is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| they are the only utility that doesn't distribute their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| payment in lieu of taxes to the county in which the customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| they serve live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5905)|
| 1:38:26| Well, I understand, and I ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| And they said it took a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| to build up this system in Knox County and in Loudoun County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| and in this popular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| I mean, if you look at Teleco Village and all these areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| I mean, it took a lot of money to build all that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| And I don't know what their status is on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| It's kind of like Hallsdale Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| Their rates went up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| They spent a lot of money building that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| And until they can recover some of that funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| I don't know that the rates are going to change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| But anyway, that's what they said on that interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Not taking a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| But they are the only system in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| that has this arrangement where it all goes back to one entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| If we would speak of KUB, they have investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| in Granger County and Union County, I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| because that's the end of the county I'm from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| And their payment in lieu of taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| are to Granger County and Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| And if we go to the North City's utility board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5965)|
| 1:39:29| the money is paid to the governmental entity, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| I would question whether or not they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| had an investment in Knox County at building the utility system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5975)|
| 1:39:41| I would say that the utility board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| based on its customer base, has constructed the utility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5984)|
| 1:39:54| You're going to the direct question of who issued the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5997)|
| 1:39:58| The expense, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| Who has the expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| Anything else on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| Oh, and one other thing, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| Probably should be involved in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| the North City Utilities Board has a board of directors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| which is not influenced by anything in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| And the people that are members that consume that utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6025)|
| 1:40:30| probably in Knox County, should have some representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| I would ask for the law director to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| They actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| I did some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| There is a gentleman in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| that represents Knox County interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| And then there's another individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| There's actually two from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6049)|
| 1:40:54| Who are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| Who are they appointed by, Knoxville or beyond Greece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| No, that's First Utility District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| It's Buddy Hines, but it's the Buddy Hines in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6063)|
| 1:41:11| But he's appointed by our mayor, is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6071)|
| 1:41:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6073)|
| 1:41:14| I believe that's correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| So we have appointments on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6075)|
| 1:41:15| I'm trying to think of the other individual right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| and I've just hit a blank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| But there are two now from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| that serve on their board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| And they meet the same time as we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| during our commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| That was some discussion that we were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| sure of at the legislative lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| So that looks like that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| I'll get the name for the other individual for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6098)|
| 1:41:45| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| We'll go move our discussion to the DUI litter pickup crew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6106)|
| 1:41:56| You just want a recap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| Well, I was wondering if you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| us to pass any resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| I would prefer to hold off until we hear back from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| I ask Eddie Smith, and Representative Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| and someone else to talk to the lieutenant governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| because he's running very behind time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6136)|
| 1:42:19| Let me find out, and I'll, let's discuss this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| And I'll get the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| And that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| And Commissioner Schoonmaker, discussion of the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| administration fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| Well, obviously it's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| We had excellent press coverage, not only from the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| Focus, but the Knoxville New Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| in this morning's edition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| So I've had a response back from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| of the commissioners in Anderson County already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| So I think things are starting well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| I'm asking these things because the legislature's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| about to go in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| Do you think we need to bring forth a resolution on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6179)|
| 1:43:04| I don't think so at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6184)|
| 1:43:13| On to the next item of discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| that is the emails that come through the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Yeah, I'd like to talk about this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6201)|
| 1:43:21| So we'll defer that till.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6201)|
| 1:43:27| Any announcements or any other needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6207)|
| 1:43:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6213)|
| 1:43:49| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| I've got one very important request from Mike Steele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| He spoke with me earlier before our meeting started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| and wanted me to strongly encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| any commissioners who have not sent in a Christmas story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| to send him a Christmas story or a remembrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| So there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Mr. Steele, when's the deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| Two weeks ago this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS171211?start=6252)|
