| 0:05:59| I think this location has moved. It has moved a couple weeks ago over to Happy Holler while we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| continue remodeling and reconstruction at the Orangery location in Bearden. Okay. Sergeant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=365)|
| 0:06:12| Coward? No record. Mr. Berg? That file is complete. Okay. Nice. Do I have a motion? I'll make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=372)|

| 0:06:32| Happy Holler? Like what is the expectation? The goal would be is that the restaurant will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| pop-up bistro by the tracks until the renovations are done. The name plate for liquor license for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| the state of Tennessee will go back to Bearden and hopefully the community of Happy Holler will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| tell us what they like about the restaurant and what they don't like about the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| We will have to come back before Beer Board with a new name, but we will hopefully be able to stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| permanently. So do you think there will be a lapse between one restaurant concept and the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| Might be as short as a few days just depends on how things work. So I need to come down and sample| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| everything and give you feedback? Please come sample what is a smaller menu a bistro by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| tracks, but if you know we're obviously watching what sales if the burger ends up being the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| seller we might go in that direction. If seafood ends up being the best seller we might move in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| that direction. We are really enjoying the space. We completed it in 2020 as COVID was started and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=442)|
| 0:07:31| never opened that restaurant up. We've been catering out of there for quite some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| but with the move of the name and everything need to come back before Beer Board. So that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=455)|
| 0:07:41| we're here today, but really it's we've had great turnout from the community. A lot of walk-ups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| We've been very pleased, but at the same time Miss Fugate has asked a question about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=465)|
| 0:07:51| orangery. We have no idea when that space will be finished, so we are playing it by ear at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| times. Are you thinking like three months, six months? It's the world. It's the world of world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| shortages and logistics and we have no idea. No clue. All right. All right. Well appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| info. I wasn't sure. Yes ma'am, but we are excited about the neighborhood. Obviously you have seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| us in the neighborhood before as guests of other establishments and we love the neighborhood. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=493)|

| 0:08:24| All those in favor? Any opposed? All right. Thank you very much. All right. Next up we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=504)|
| 0:08:34| Cumberland House Knoxville, which is I think they weren't where they were unable to make it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| for the meeting. Is that correct Mr. Burr? Yes ma'am. Yeah, they'd like to defer for another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| Okay. So they would like to defer to August. Move to defer to August. Yes ma'am. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=524)|

| 0:09:37| about 400 people from the contractor architecture and lots of other businesses in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=577)|
| 0:09:44| So it's going to be a great event. We're excited. Nice. All right. Sergeant Coward? No record. Mr. Burr?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=584)|

| 0:10:42| Sir, we want businesses in the city of Knoxville to survive, or more than survive, we want them to thrive and do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=642)|
| 0:10:50| But we want them to do so within the bounds of the laws and ordinances related to alcohol and beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=650)|
| 0:10:58| This is a former Sonic drive-in location. Yeah. So, you know, you're going to have outdoor tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=658)|
| 0:11:07| Yes. And, you know, you can take an open beer to somebody in outdoor tables, but you also need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| realize you can't take an open beer to someone sitting in their car. Yeah. So what are the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=673)|

| 0:11:40| drinking it in their car. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. We just wanted to make sure. That's what I'm saying. Yeah. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| That's what I'm saying. Before, like, take to the car, you know, say, like, hey, you can do that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=705)|
| 0:11:51| So on the table, it's okay. But if you want to take it, it's, I mean, we're asking to the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| guy, and they say, it's still like, we have one, because we have other business, say, you can sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=718)|
| 0:12:03| alcohol to go from the next year. But, like, I don't do it because I don't want to be in trouble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| you know what I'm saying? Right. But we, since this is an old Sonic, and people like to sit in cars. Oh, yeah, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| Yeah. But, like I say, we don't do that, you know. We sell only on the table. All right. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| No problem. Okay. Sergeant Howard. No record. Mr. Byrd. Just needed approvals from the inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=741)|
| 0:12:30| and fire prevention departments. All right. So, do I have a motion? Move to approve pending submission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=750)|
| 0:12:39| of final documentation. All right. Is there any discussion? Councilwoman Ryder. Yeah. So, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| wanted to follow up on some of the questions that Mr. Frost had. First off, I've eaten at your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| establishment before. It was delicious. Thank you. Okay. And we enjoyed it. I do know that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=769)|
| 0:12:55| to go up to the window to order. Oh, yeah. Correct? And then you guys are not going to the cars. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| don't deliver to the cars. That was my experience. So, I guess, to assuage some of the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=780)|
| 0:13:06| would it be possible to maybe rope off, or would it be a better idea to kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=786)|
| 0:13:15| rope off or fence off? Yeah. Right now, we try to close, you know, make little restaurant there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| Uh-huh. We try to... Enclose. Is that what you mean? Yeah. We close inside. Uh-huh. But maybe I'm working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=800)|
| 0:13:27| with the permit right now. Okay. But actually, we don't serve alcohol to go. It's only on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=807)|

| 0:24:13| that. I was wondering if we got a 90-day extension and the process happens sooner than that. Can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| just call Mark and get on the board earlier? Okay. Yes. Yes, I would love a 90-days extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| Move to extend for 90 days. All right. Any discussion? All those in favor? Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1467)|

| 0:24:50| Mr. Berg? That's right. Mr. Gutita reached out to me earlier today with concern that he might not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| able to make it because he had staffing issues, difficulty covering the restaurant for him to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1496)|
| 0:25:02| here and asked that in the event he didn't, if I would kindly request of the board a 30-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1502)|
| 0:25:11| until he could appear. Okay. If he hasn't, I guess, the permit. All right. So they have requested a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| 30-day extension. I'd suggest we give him 90 days because he can always come back early. Sure. Looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| like he's just missing building inspection. Yeah. Is that right? Yes, sir. Yeah, I think the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| is whether he needs to build an additional aspect of the bar or whether he can get by without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| I kind of thought maybe I'd reach out to building inspections to see if I could, there may be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| language issue there, and I can clarify it for him, their position on that. Maybe it's nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1544)|
| 0:25:51| really. You can resolve it easily. Mr. Frost, is there any reason for us not to extend for 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| since the applicant's not here? Well, yes. I think because the applicant's not here, I would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| to extend for 30 days. I did find it interesting if he's serving people and the only thing he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| missing is his building inspections approval. Is he real close or something? Well, as I understood it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| as best I could sort of parse out the message, the building inspection approval for the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1577)|
| 0:26:26| inspection was he needed to submit a plan for electrical and plumbing of a bar, but he doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| have a bar. I presume the plan must be to serve bottled beers, and I just wondered if both parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1593)|
| 0:26:41| fully understood each other's position, and I thought I would reach out and bridge that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| hopefully. The beer board can do what they want, but considering the gentleman's not here, it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| be good for him to report back at the next beer board meeting to discuss what's going on. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| seems like a good idea, so I'll just make a motion to extend for 30 days, and we'll hear from him then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1619)|
| 0:27:06| Okay, I've got a motion to extend for 30 days. Do I have a second? Oh, sorry. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-220726?start=1626)|
