| 0:08:22| Yes, I'd like to add just a short discussion item regarding the Legislative Affairs Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| just a quick update for the committee members and the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=508)|

| 0:09:14| As for the item on the line item transfer, I think it would be best to wait until the item comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| and do a substitute motion removing it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=563)|

| 0:15:24| It's Resolution 201,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| approving an amended Intergovernmental Memorandum of Understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| between the Knox County Commission, the Mayor of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| and the Knox County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| regarding the Board of Education's repayment of $9,968,536 to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=936)|
| 0:15:44| for the remainder of its capital improvement project for energy management equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Okay, do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| All right, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=955)|
| 0:15:56| Okay, the motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=956)|

| 0:16:02| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| All right, go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Chris, if you would, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| for the benefit of the two commissioners that weren't on our body last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| when we passed this resolution originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| if you could give them just a brief summation of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| and let us know why we're here again today with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| So last year what we brought before the Board was a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| with an agreement between the Board of Education and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| repaying basically us loaning them $12 million, I think was the original amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=988)|
| 0:16:37| for a train agreement that was the work was done some years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| but the funding piece was never approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| And so when that was found at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| we went back and calculated an amount that we thought was correct for that agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| and brought that before the Board for approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| basically taking money from fund balance from debt service fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| to transfer to a public improvement fund for said improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1022)|
| 0:17:08| as it relates to the train contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1028)|
| 0:17:11| with the agreement that they would pay back that amount over a period of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| for a set amount of money with zero interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| And so we put that in place, and when we did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| the Board approved it, school board and county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| We went back and found out that some of the calculations that we made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| including some of the improvements that we thought were in there, were not in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| So what this is doing is revising the amount of the payback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| and so basically it's a reduction for the schools per that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1059)|
| 0:17:46| and so their payment to us in lieu of them going out and borrowing the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| will just be reduced, and that will be paid over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| We have agreed to a repayment schedule that has been reduced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| and so that will put that in place with an amount that we both agree to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| in lieu of what we thought was an estimated amount that turned out to be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| Clear as mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| Commissioner Smith, your light's still on. Do you have any additional comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Yes, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Chris, if you would, explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| I'm going to make sure everybody understands that this is coming from our reserve debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| that this is money that we have set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Actually, we set aside enough money to pay our bonds at the highest possible flexible rate they could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| and this is not money that we're digging into that we do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| And also the change in the payment schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| I guess some of the payments reduced from $1.5 million to $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| are a reflection of the reduction from $11 million to $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| So what will happen is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| At the time that we loaned this money to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| I think debt service had $23 million to $24 million in fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| which allowed us to do this loan and bring that amount down to about $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1149)|
| 0:19:13| with a repayment structure, I think it was like 10 to 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| And so we will not pull any of that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| I think what we will do is the amount that they will pay us will be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| And so ultimately debt service will get made whole again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| and so it's just a correction upon an amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| and we worked with Trane during that process to find what that correct amount was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1176)|
| 0:19:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Okay, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| In the 2018 payment, what month did they make their payment back to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1188)|
| 0:19:54| Oh, wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And when will they make their 2019 payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| I think we normally structure those towards the end of the fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| I mean, you are assuming that they've made their payment for 2018?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| It would have already been made for 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Because that fiscal year is not closed for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| but it would have been made prior to June 30, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| All right, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Mr. Caldwell, what is the total amount that was the original amount, I think, was estimated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| It's a little bit over $11 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| Just ballpark it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Oh, and Novato's got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| I think it was almost $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| $11.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| $11.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| And you mentioned something about there would be a reduction in that total that would be paid back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| This is close to $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| It went from $11.9 million to $10.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| It basically dropped $1.9 because what had happened was our calculation included some funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1260)|
| 0:21:08| that were already in that improvement fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| And so what that does then is it lowers the amount that they will pay us back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1274)|
| 0:21:19| because we had already included that in a different capital draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| as it relates to train projects in a different phase of train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| Okay, I'm just trying to figure out how if our balance is made whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| how it's reduced by $1.9 million if it's going to be made whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| What I should say is it's made whole because we were basically trying to build them twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| not intentionally, but there are different phases of the train contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| And so what had happened was when we calculated that $11.9,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| there were things that was in for Gresham and Phase 3A that we had counted in that $11.9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1312)|
| 0:21:59| that should not have been in there that we're currently billing them for already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| Was that correction made with train also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| Train has been whole all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| Okay, yeah, would you mind stating your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Yes, Owen Novatter, train here in Knoxville, 5220 Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| And we can have a little fun, and it's all Commissioner Daly's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| No, actually, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1350)|
| 0:22:32| Commissioner Daly brought it to our attention a year ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| and so we had some time to look through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| But all that happened was this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| When they accounted for the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| there was a little bit of co-mingling of capital improvement funds versus the train energy program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| And so we just all got together and figured out exactly what got paid from where and backed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1369)|
| 0:22:54| And so the numbers have been reconciled across the county and across train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| Train was not we were whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| In other words, we had been paid properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| This was just, I think, a misunderstanding of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| probably primarily on the part of the school's financial guy at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| Commissioner Gill, your light was on earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| He answered my question about the capital improvement for train.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| That was the question I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| A couple of questions for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| Is there a reason that when we transfer the school funding over on June 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1415)|
| 0:23:44| that we don't take that that's not subtracted out at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| instead of waiting another full year to get repaid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Yeah, I don't think we came up with an agreement or found what this area was until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| It was July or August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| So we came up on the agreement and decided this was the best way to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| with the repayment schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Not only the county agreed with, but the schools agreed with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1443)|
| 0:24:13| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Our next item is item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1469)|
| 0:24:38| Go ahead, madam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Resolution 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| It's approving an agreement with Cope Associates Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| in the amount of $59,900 plus reimbursable expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| to provide construction documents for completion of the Powell Middle School kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| There's a motion that's been made to approve by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| Second by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1503)|
| 0:25:07| What I was bringing this off of consent was that when I first got on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| over four years ago, one of the things I discovered was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Powell Middle School had not been fully completed as I saw by the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| And there was a big room out there that just had rock on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1522)|
| 0:25:26| It did have an air conditioning on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| It had doors going to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And our walk-in cooler was still sitting, and it is still sitting, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| on a trailer behind Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| And that was somewhat ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| That's a long time, but it's probably in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| Amy, Russ Oaks, Knox County Schools, 912 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Yes, Commissioner, it's been a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| and that kitchen's been in that state longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| And the reason why I wanted to bring this off was it shows on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| when this was completed that Powell Middle School had been completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| on time ahead of schedule and under budget, and there was some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I think it was like $250,000 that was added back to the, or thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| I don't have that stuff in front of me that showed it had been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| And my question to the school system was why was it not finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| And I got an answer back, which is on record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| saying that they didn't plan to complete that room anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| And on the plans that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| it shows that there was a thing that it should have been completed by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| I don't know what it was originally agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| but it kind of struck me kind of to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| But the plans were on file that shows what was supposed to be in that kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| and now I see we're spending another $59,900 for the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| And who did the original plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| I believe that I'd have to go back and check, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| Let me get that for you and send that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| But I can tell you it was originally designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| when we did the school addition on the cafeteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1637)|
| 0:27:22| but it was bid as an alternate because we were concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| whether we had the money and the budget to do it as part of the whole project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| So that's why we had to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| And it has to be we had to bring in another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| or bring in and do some additional design on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| because so much time has passed between the original design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| and the current design that it's not acceptable anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Okay. Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Is the air conditioning on top of that, has it ever been turned on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| I'll have to go back and double check for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| I don't know how much of that space that AC unit covers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| whether it's just the kitchen or whether it's the kitchen and the dining area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| But if it's the dining area, then the answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| There was a space in the roofing that shows that there's a facility in that rock room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I was just asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1700)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1702)|

| 0:28:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| I have a question about when we look at our capital improvement projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| where is the priority for completing Powell's Kitchen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| Where does it rank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Well, it's approved as a project on this year's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1728)|

| 0:28:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| Commissioner Bussler, I have been in that room before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1734)|
| 0:28:56| when the air conditioning has been running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| So the rock room had been cooled, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| It is plumbed for heat and air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Okay. I'd like to call this for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1747)|

| 0:29:12| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| All right. It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Next item will be item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| It's resolution 217.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| It's authorizing the acceptance of Safe Schools grant funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| in the amount of $505,730.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| with the required in-kind local match of at least $306,210| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| and a school safety grant in the amount of $1,111,230| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| with the required local match of at least $765,570| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| from the Tennessee Department of Education for fiscal year 2019.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| All right. Thank you, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1792)|
| 0:29:53| Do you have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Okay. The motion to approve was by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| The second was by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| Okay. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| By the way, I see multiple lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| I was the one who actually pulled this from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| We'll ensue discussion, but anything related to safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| I do think is really worthy of this body making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| that the public knows that we're working on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1817)|
| 0:30:20| So I'll begin with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1820)|
| 0:30:25| I have a question for the school board representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Is the required match on this accounted for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| and planned for in your current fiscal budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| Yes, Commissioner, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| We currently spend about counting the general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1838)|
| 0:30:44| and the capital budget about $6.1 million for FY19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1849)|
| 0:30:50| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| I'm trying to figure out how much Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| we're going to be spending on matching grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| and how much total money are we approving here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| and I was trying to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Is it like 3.2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| How do you add these numbers together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| Because it doesn't really match up on some of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| Go ahead. Tell me how you do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| Let me take a run at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| These are both state grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| and they have identified a certain level of match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| that they want to receive from the school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| as they apply for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| What that match indicates is they want us to be spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| that amount of money in security in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| before we get any grant money from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| So when you go back and you look at our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| we're spending about $5.1 million in salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| for school security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| and their equipment and things that go like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| and then we're spending about another 1 or 1.1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| in our capital budget for capital expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| for such things as cameras and radios and fencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| and those type items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| So that $6.1 million is what covers our match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| It's stuff that we had planned to do anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| and we are probably spending and doing as much in security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| as any other school system in the state in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| Okay, so let me get this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1954)|
| 0:32:38| What we're looking at here on item number 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| we have a grant of $505,730,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and we'll be adding $306,210 to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| which will make that first grant $811,940?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| We're saying we're already spending that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| so the grant is on top of what we're already spending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| So we're spending...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| Okay, the school grant funding in the amount of $505,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| is that coming from here or is that coming from the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| That's coming from the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Okay, the $306,210 is coming from...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| That's the match for the $505,730.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Okay, and then the $1,100,000 and something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| that is the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| That is the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| And then our match is going to be $765,557?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2015)|
| 0:33:36| Okay, and that's what we're approving right now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| The matching funds you've already approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| as part of our FY19 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| What the board approved last week and what's before commission now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| is to accept the grant funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| I wish to comment on your opening statement about this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| saying this is a safety issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| and that you want to hear discussion related to safety issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| when they're before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2048)|
| 0:34:09| I'd also like to comment then on, I'll call him Colonel Oaks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2049)|
| 0:34:17| comments that Knox County may be ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| as far as facility issues go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| and making sure that our educational sites are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Having attended many Board of Education meetings over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| I know that the Knox County Board of Education has really wrestled earnestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| in making sure that there is security in vestibules, doors, locks, and fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| and that Knox County is ahead of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| as related to other county educational systems across the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| And I commend the current administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| for the efforts that they have been engaged in for the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| at making sure we are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| And I believe we've got somebody who'd like to speak just to that part of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Russ, I know you're sitting, do you have another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2110)|
| 0:35:15| Oh, I'm just tag-teaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| Okay, you're just tag-teaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Yeah, that was, and to what Commissioner Wright's point was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| that was the reason why I personally pulled this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| was I knew how important this part was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| and I think that for the public welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| they need to know exactly what Commissioner Wright has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| that we can talk budget stuff here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| but ultimately our schools and our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| this is one of the most important things we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| is be tasked with protecting our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| So thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| That's exactly why I brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And Russ, would you like to add anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| If you'll let me elaborate just a little bit for clarity's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| Ms. Massey deals with this every year with our security department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| We have a recurring grant that's a school security safe schools grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2158)|
| 0:36:07| and that's a recurring grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| That's that $500,000 or so that you're seeing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And then we have one-time money that the state's making available to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| in a school security grant that goes through the same approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| That's the $1.1 million for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| So that's available for one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| You won't see that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| The amount that we're investing from our general purpose budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| and from our capital budget has been reoccurring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| and we have kept that from year to year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| and the intent at this point is to continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| Our thought is our best security is our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| and the lion's share of our investment goes into security officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| and equipping them and training them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| and working with the Knoxville Sheriff's Office and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| But we also need to make capital investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2221)|
| 0:37:06| and those have come in the form of upgraded camera systems in our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| and entrance security and buzz locks and locks on all of our doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| and some proximity cards in use on our doors rather than keys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2238)|
| 0:37:22| and a number of different areas that we try to pay attention to on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| And as you all were intimating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| security is not something that we will ever be finished with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| or that we can ever stop investing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| And items that we looked at a year or two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| and thought that's adequate or that's acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| we'll come back and do an evaluation this year and look at it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| well, gee, what made us think that was a good idea at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| And then we'll have to go back in and update or address those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2272)|
| 0:37:56| because the nature of the threat evolves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| As someone who has visited our schools many times over the last eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I've seen the progressive improvement in security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| and the camera systems that we have today are far greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| than exceed the ones we had six, seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| These provide great security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| The SRL officers are an invaluable resource to schools for the things they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| And the security systems not only provide security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| but they also are a measure of defense against liability issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| that we face in the school system, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| Thank you all for the work you all have been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| All right, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2328)|
| 0:38:49| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Excuse me for the interruption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| This is not a security issue, but you introduced attending dignitaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| Who do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| My constituent and our sheriff is now in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| and I wish to thank him for the sandwich lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Sheriff Spangler, thank you so much for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| Do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| And Commissioner Wright, I appreciate you catching him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| That was perfect timing after the safety discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| Yes, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| About that lunch, it was mentioned to me that there's no chocolate chip cookies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| and I would like to wonder why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| He's making changes already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| He's making changes already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| That's the way the cookie crumbles, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Moving on with our agenda, we now have Item 31 is the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| It's Resolution 222.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| It's authorizing the acceptance of a grant award in the amount of $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| from the National Endowment for the Arts in support of the 2019 Children's Festival of Reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| requires an in-kind match of $29,240 and a cash match of $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| which will be funded through corporate sponsorships and grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| Do I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| So moved by Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| Second by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Do we have anyone from the Knox County Public Libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| Rita Black, Knox County Library, 500 West Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| Thank you for asking about the Children's Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| It is the 15th year that we have conducted the Children's Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| It is our kickoff event, and it's our signature event for the Children's Summer Reading Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| This is the seventh year that the NEA has provided funding for the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| What it does is provide children and families an opportunity to meet national award-winning authors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2467)|
| 0:41:14| illustrators, and storytellers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| And if you recall, in recent times, we have had Mo Willems of Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| We've had Alyssa Caporillo, who is the author of The Biscuit Books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2482)|
| 0:41:26| And, of course, Eric Litwin of Pete the Cat fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| So they are nationally known and award-winning authors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| It costs about $45,000 to present the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| It is funded by grants and sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| There are about 12,000 to 15,000 people who attend each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| And, of course, the event has become widely known,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| and we now have authors who wish to return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| And we have other authors who have heard about the event and contact us to be a presenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| And the comment is that it is the most well-run festival of its kind around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| So that's kudos to the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| Our Children's Services Committee, our communications staff, and others that are involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| do a fabulous job in putting on this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| It's a pretty significant undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| And, of course, Casey Fox is our library fund development manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| and she writes the grants, she writes the sponsorship requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| and that's how we fund this particular event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| So I would encourage you on May 18th next year to come on down to the World's Fair Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| and see what we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| We, of course, are excited because this celebrates children, reading, and literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| and that's where we need to get our readership and build from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| So we appreciate the support for all of that, and we're just thrilled to be able to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| And, Commissioner Gill, have you got a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| I want to speak briefly because I've been to such an outstanding event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| But I think we really must capture the significance of reading and literacy in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| And it is going to be an unbelievable opportunity as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| so that we can make sure our young people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| that we will provide every opportunity for them to have access to quality literature of a diverse nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2603)|
| 0:43:32| And thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Could you go into some detail on what the in-kind match-up is for the $29,240,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| and why is it also stipulated as a cash match of $20,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| The in-kind is from our media outlets, radio, TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| The other support is from PILOT, CBID, ORNL, Federal Credit Union,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| East Tennessee Pediatric Dentistry, and vendor income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2642)|
| 0:44:07| So it's really you've got to get $20,000 to get the $10,000, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| The in-kind is not relevant then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| It requires that, but we also have to spend that amount to get the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| You're very welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| One thing I might add while I saw you walking up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| I want to show my Knox County Public Library card here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2666)|
| 0:44:30| and let you know how much we all appreciate the work you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| to help our community and share these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| The motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| The next item is Item 34.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| It's Resolution 402, Approving a Grant Contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, Nonpoint Source Section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| in the amount of $115,000 with the required local match of $115,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2702)|
| 0:45:08| for the Stock Creek Watershed Initiative Phase 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| for the period beginning January 16, 2019 and ending July 31, 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2711)|
| 0:45:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I'd like to entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Motion for approval by Commissioner Jay with a second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| First, I see your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| Could you please share with us some of the work that you're working on with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| Yeah, and I can share a few general details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| I've got the project managers here as well, Tracy Jones and Roy Arthur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| that have worked and secured this grant and done great work for us in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| But in general, this is to remove both Castile Branch and Stock Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| from the impaired stream list or the 303D TDEC listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| by the working with farmers to minimize siltation into the stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| as well as repairing failing cesspits systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| to prevent E. coli from getting in those streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I notice we have two commissioners with their lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| Commissioner, is that, say, Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2787)|
| 0:46:28| Could you talk about phase one and the results of the first part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| and what the impact was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Actually, let me get Roy to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| He was the project manager on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| and I'd rather him speak to those specific details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2803)|
| 0:46:55| Roy Arthur, Knox County Stormwater, 7911 Labor Way, Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| Tracy Jones, Knox County Stormwater, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| We're going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| Sure, Arthur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2830)|
| 0:47:11| Could you just talk about phase one and the impact that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| for the first part of this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Phase one, this is about the 10th water quality grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| that we have gotten in the past 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| to the tune of about $2.242 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| And they've all been water quality grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| but in Stock Creek in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| we have been working in two phases, like Jim said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| to remove the stream from the 303D list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| for two different parameters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| One would be sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| The other one would be E. coli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| We all know E. coli is dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| We've just had an incident with that in a daycare here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| The first grant that we got down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| was $150,000 to treat sediment and septic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2879)|
| 0:48:08| At the time that we started that grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| the entire stream and all of its tributaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| were listed for sediment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| We worked with farmers in particular down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| with this grant on the sediment issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| and we had all but one small branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| and that would be Castile Branch, one small tributary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| All the rest of it was taken off the impaired list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| after we completed that grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| We also fixed 25 septic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Now, this is a cost-share grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| We paid 75% of the cost out of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2922)|
| 0:48:45| The homeowner pays 25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| and we managed to lower the E. coli levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| to where we're just about that far from the state standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| And with this grant, we hope to completely remove that stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2935)|
| 0:48:59| from the state's list of impaired streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| Thank you, Mr. Arthur. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| I'll take this time to brag on Roy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| Roy was a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| We worked together on the Stock Creek Watershed Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| with Ruth Ann, and that was a great task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| and he came probably three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| Our first process, he came to the homeowners group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| and you're invited again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| And they're very, very active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| and with Roy's help, we have cleaned up Stock Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| We wish we could put some curves back in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Many years ago, Farmers Straighten made it a straight line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| probably the straightest line creek you'll ever see in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| and that's why we have a lot of sediment going through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| But I just want to brag on Roy. Roy, you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Thank you. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I also would like to say thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| but there are some people that watch us on TV in the middle of the night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| so if this happens to catch someone about Stock Creek and septic systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| or Castile Branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| another one that could be mentioned is Roseberry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| It still has open grants on its matching, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Are there other creeks or tributaries that you can name just right off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| So if people are watching us with failed septic systems on those tributaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3024)|
| 0:50:30| they can contact Knox County and get some relief and assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| in helping replace those systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3035)|
| 0:50:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| They could call Knox County Stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| We will have, of course, the Stock Creek grant starting the middle of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| But at Roseberry Creek, we have money to fix septic systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| there once again on a 75% cost share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3048)|
| 0:50:52| Call Knox County Stormwater and we will get the process started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| Tracy is actually running that grant for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| But in addition, we have another grant in Flat Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| which is right next to Roseberry Creek up in the upper east end of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| upper northeast end of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| And that also, there is money available there to cost share on septic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3074)|
| 0:51:21| I want to say one thing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3081)|
| 0:51:24| We started targeting E. coli.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| It is about, oh, five years ago, I guess, we started targeting E. coli| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3087)|
| 0:51:34| because it turns out that that is the single biggest problem that we have in our creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| And most of it comes from whether you know it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| MPC tells us that 45% of our households at Knox County are on septic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| And I can tell you, and Tracy, who is a soil scientist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| can tell you that we got bad soils for septic systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| And so I'm very, very proud of the fact that we're able to help people do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3119)|
| 0:52:04| The average cost of a septic system repair is about $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| Many of the people that we work with, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| all of our grants right now are targeting low to moderate income areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| And many people cannot afford $5,000 to fix their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| And the health department isn't going to kick them out of their houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| They can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| But if we have an opportunity to take a $5,000 fix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| and the homeowner only has to pay $1,250,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| I think that's a good thing that we're doing for the taxpayers of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Just one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Are you all in partnership with the health department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| Knox County Health Department, on the E. coli?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Okay. This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| Opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3181)|
| 0:53:03| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Item 35, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| It's Resolution 403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| It's approving a contract with the company to be determined for automatic vehicle location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| AV global positioning, GPS services at a rate to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3196)|
| 0:53:21| Okay. Just to add in a little bit more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| this is the details on this contract Jill handed out to all of our commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3205)|
| 0:53:30| and the details are also attached to this agenda item on our online website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| The reason I pulled this one was because at the time of posting the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| the name of the company, I believe, was not available at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| So I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| I've got a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| I've got a motion to send without recommendation from Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| and a second by Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Yes, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Hey, Jim, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I know we've used this in the past very effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| but what was the cost of the last contract per vehicle, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| Yeah, let me, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| It's actually went down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| This contract's five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| It actually went down, so we're getting a lot of value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| but I can't remember a specific amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| It says on the contract it'll go down by $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Yeah, it's Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| So it is going down by about $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| It used to be $17 per user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| In addition to that $17 a month per user,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| there was an upfront cost of about $200 per device that the county had to buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| And then there was difficulties, as you might imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| of having the inventory and making sure we have enough and buying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| and activating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| When we went to this new proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| we solicited pricing to just give us the cost per user| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3299)|
| 0:55:04| and allow us to charge the departments however much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| If you have five GPSs, you have five costs per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| If you have ten, you have ten per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| And the way it worked out, it's really beneficial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| is the price went down and the county's not going to have that upfront cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3317)|
| 0:55:21| So it's kind of a win-win with the proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| So it's gone down from $17 a month to $15.98 per month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| but also completely removed those upfront costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| And so what if we need new equipment, we lose some or some breaks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3334)|
| 0:55:39| It's not in the contract, so I don't see it in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3339)|
| 0:55:43| Well, the vendor has agreed to give the fleet service folks a handful of units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| leave them unactivated, and then, say, a different department wanted to add one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| property assessor, clerks, parks and rec or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| they would just turn it on and then start charging them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| So there's no upfront fee for the equipment at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| No, and I think part of that is the total life of the contract was extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| Instead of a five-year award where it's individual year after year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| this was a three-year award with a total of several additional renewals for up to nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| So it's kind of sweetened the pot by making a longer-term contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| but it also kept those costs low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3388)|
| 0:56:29| Mr. Law Director, are we allowed to go that nine-year contract deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Yeah, you can renew, I think it's up to 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3395)|
| 0:56:39| but it's also the aggregate amount that we spend will affect the purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3399)|
| 0:56:46| and Matt Myers, under the new rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| will be monitoring that for any rebid we may have to do before nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| So we have an escape requirement in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| So the basic cost per unit you said was, what was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| It's $15.98 per user per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| Per user per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| And then you have these other fees under payment, which is item number 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3436)|
| 0:57:21| and then you have charges at driver service ID, $35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3441)|
| 0:57:29| You have additional key fobs are $25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| Is that also calculated in some of the payment, too, if you happen to lose one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Well, we ask them, you know, like on the proposal side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| we ask them to propose a lot of different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3464)|
| 0:57:49| The $15.98 is the typical tracker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| It's actually into the onboard diagnostic device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3471)|
| 0:57:54| It's got an OBD-II port, kind of just plugs in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3474)|
| 0:57:58| That's what the $15.98 is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| If departments wanted to track their personnel, there are other pricing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| There is like a menu of other pricing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| and the provision to add and delete additional types of devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| that might have different fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| That $35 you're talking about is, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| if you wanted to have a pickup truck that has five different users| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| and you always wanted to know what user was in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| you could elect to pay a little bit more money and get this key fob system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| that would allow you to not only just know where the vehicle is at all times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| or asset, but also be able to know who it is that's operating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3516)|
| 0:58:41| The county has not chosen to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| That was an option under the previous contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| We never chose to do it, but it's nice to have those there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3525)|
| 0:58:48| so you don't have to go out to bid for a whole new service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| if you just want to add a different functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3532)|
| 0:58:55| So what this is is just options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| It is some options, and there's some other devices that are for equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| like a large piece of heavy equipment that may not move very often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3541)|
| 0:59:08| It maybe has some battery backup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| There's some other types of vehicles like heavy snow plows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| that might not take that onboard diagnostic type of device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| It might need to be hardwired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| But in general, most of the county vehicles that have been using this tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| are using like a plug-and-play onboard diagnostic type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| We'll be using that OBD-II type, and that will be the price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| unless there's some different type of install.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3581)|
| 0:59:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| How many other companies are on the vendors list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| Oh, there were quite a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| There were about 16, I believe, proposals that were received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| and it got narrowed down to three, and then we had actual meetings with three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| The scores were put in by all the reviewers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| and then we narrowed it down to three and met with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| and had a full demo of their stuff and chose the re-submitted scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3607)|
| 1:00:13| and then it came to the final one, which is LB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Hey, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| This is a continuation of the same company we've been dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| so will we still have it is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| It will be a different company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| Will that provide the same type of data as motion and movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| that we can use in accident analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| I'm actually looking forward to the, if it all proceeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| I believe it's going to even be a slightly better system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| But the old vendor was ActSoft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| We had no problems, nothing against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| It was just a five-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| It was up, and we wanted to go out to market and see what we could get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| and it actually came in LB Technologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| It's a Memphis firm, so Tennessee folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| But, again, we would not have selected them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| if we didn't feel that they would have met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| or exceeded our criteria that we set forth in the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3672)|
| 1:01:14| So they'll be able to supply us with the same amount of data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3674)|
| 1:01:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| All of our viewing of their dashboard and their online system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| it looks definitely, it's as good if not better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3685)|
| 1:01:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3695)|
| 1:01:36| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3696)|
| 1:01:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Could you just speak to that data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| Are we talking about speed, liability, traffic, diagnostics, fuel service, location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| And just help me better understand, as we track the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3703)|
| 1:01:49| the metrics of it used to performance measures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| I'll give just a few ideas of what we might use it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| You could use it as a record of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| or supervisors could use it as a record of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| So that might be, like, if you want to know how many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3723)|
| 1:02:07| your employees are stopping, like a property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3727)|
| 1:02:11| maybe they want to assess so many properties per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| and they can see if one employee does 5 or 10, another one does 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3734)|
| 1:02:18| You know, you can use that as supervision in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| There's risk reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| People who have GPS trackers on their vehicle behave differently in that vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| But you could also look at fleet utilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| So if, like, you have a fleet of vehicles and you maybe have 10 vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| one of them seems to be disused or used less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| maybe that's one that you want to consider getting rid of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3765)|
| 1:02:50| Accident reconstruction, which is what Commissioner Smith was asking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| You know, every time someone gets in an accident, there is this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| every minute there's a breadcrumb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| They have asked that information, you know, leading up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| So if someone gets in a wreck at noon, they may say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| give me everything that they had from 10 a.m. or 8 a.m. this morning until noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| And then you can see were they observing posted speed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| or were they braking, you know, or idling a lot or just driving erratically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| You can kind of look at that and see if there was anything leading up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| And then just the general transparency side of things for keeping track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| People will say, it's been snowing and you haven't plowed my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| And we could look and look at that address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| and notice that a plow went by five times in three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| So there's a couple of ways of using that system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Since it's been a few minutes, I want to restate the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| The motion was originally made by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| to send this forward with no recommendation to next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3848)|
| 1:04:09| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| Okay, that motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| The next item on our agenda is item number 36.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3854)|
| 1:04:20| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Resolution 501 is approving an agreement with HomeSource East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| to provide $697,889.55 in 2017 and 2018 Home Investment Partnerships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3865)|
| 1:04:35| Home Program Funds, and Home Community Housing Development Organization, CHDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| set-aside program funds for the construction of 12 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| of affordable senior rental housing to be known as Willow Place II,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| federally funded through HUD Home Program Funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Okay, motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| The second has been made by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3896)|
| 1:05:00| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| Okay, Dwight, if you could give us a little update on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| I hope your foot's doing better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| I think I'll make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| We appreciate the support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| This is an expansion to an existing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| that is in Commissioner Anders' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| It's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| There are 20 existing units there that are owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| and operated by HomeSource East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| and they do provide housing for low-income seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| which is very, very scarce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| Jackie Mayo, who is the President and CEO of HomeSource, is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| and if we could let her speak for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| I want you to know that they do much more than simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| put a roof over the head of disadvantaged seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3939)|
| 1:05:42| They really work hard to create within their properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| a sense of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| Seniors are at great risk, and especially poor seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| are at great risk for social isolation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| because of economic circumstances, health, lack of family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| and these are things that are essential for their well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| and longevity that we work hard to correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| and they do a fine job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| So I'd like to let Jackie, Police Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| speak to that in just a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Ms. Mayo, would you please step forward and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| and address formally for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| Jackie Mayo, HomeSource East Tennessee, 1091 on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| So we thank you for allowing us to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| to talk about our project at Willow Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| It does serve seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| We do have a care coordination program to assist the seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| to age in place for as long as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Most of our folks either leave because they pass away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| or they have to go to a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| So at Willow Place, our age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| the oldest person there right now is 88,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| so they are able to stay a lot longer than a lot of folks get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| It is for very low-income seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| and without this option, they don't really have a lot of options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4014)|
| 1:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4022)|
| 1:07:03| Is there any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4035)|
| 1:07:16| And thank you for your hard work in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4036)|
| 1:07:17| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| The next item before us is Item No. 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| It's Resolution 801, Approving and Authorizing the Acceptance of Funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| from the Various Sources in the Fiscal Year 2017-2018 Knox County Budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| for the Furtherance of Certain Programs as Described in the Attached Listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| There's been a motion to send without recommendation by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4065)|
| 1:07:49| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| Was that by Commissioner Wright or by Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| And the second was by Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| Is there any discussion at this time on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| Mr. Caldwell, do you want to give us a preview of what we're going to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| about next week or give us a little more insight right now for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| There's an awful lot to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| What you have before you that we passed out, and I apologize for the late correction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| but we got a new estimate on our reserve for workers' comp and general liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4100)|
| 1:08:30| and it went up by about $3 million this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| So we're going to have to transfer some funds from general fund over to our risk management fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4113)|
| 1:08:41| to cover that increase in that reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| And so that's why you see the late increase of $1 million under the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4124)|
| 1:08:49| What this is, just so you know, we used to do this back in 2012 and kind of stopped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| and the auditors have recommended that we start it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| It's basically for the commission to approve any estimations and appropriations that we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4139)|
| 1:09:06| that are related to any accounts that are reserved or committed funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4146)|
| 1:09:13| And so the bigger piece of that would be in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4153)|
| 1:09:16| You'll see things on there from sexual offender registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| All that money at the end of the year are reserved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| and then what we do after we reserve that we estimate and appropriate as it is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| And so the auditors just recommend that we get legislative body approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| and they're okay with it being at the end of the year as that is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| So you'll see things like that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| An example of a commitment that is on this list is victim assistance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| and so that is you, Mr. Andrews, you may remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| You may be the only one who was around during this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4190)|
| 1:09:53| So the commission passed a fee to attach to court fees for the Family Justice Center a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4193)|
| 1:10:05| and so that money is reserved for that purpose, and we estimate and appropriate that every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| And so that is what you see for the most part in the general fund as you go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| We do list designations, but that's already approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and you'll get on there as you'll see we estimate and appropriate funds for, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| the farmers market jail concessions, technology fees, income tax, things as it involves like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4226)|
| 1:10:36| The other funds are much more small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| So, like, in Fund 114, you will see that there is estimating appropriating of an operating transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4238)|
| 1:10:45| Anytime you see that, basically that fund to end the fiscal year was in the negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4245)|
| 1:10:51| and so we didn't want it to end in the negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| so we appropriated some funds via general fund to get that fund back in the positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| So you'll see, like, Fund 114 was basically $5,000 in the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| You'll see that 115 was fine, but appropriating encumbrances is just something that rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| So if you see encumbrances, that's going to roll from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| So we roll those encumbrances year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| Estimate and appropriate Rothschild Estates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| You all just approved one of those, and so that's what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| You'll see in Fund 116, which is solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| estimating appropriating operating transfer that would show you that fund would have been in the negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| You'll go down from that to air quality, engineering and public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| A lot of that in engineering and public works was additional funds from gas tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| that came in that we estimated and appropriated as that did come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| Same thing for the schools as it relates to BEP and things of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| So this is something that you'll start to see from us annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| We prefer to bring it once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| At the end of the fiscal year, instead of bringing you one or two every month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| because, as you could imagine, a lot of these, like in the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| when they'll call and say, you know, we're buying this, can we estimate and appropriate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| Sure, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| It's got a reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| It's a legal restriction, so that is perfectly legit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4337)|
| 1:12:22| It's just the auditors recommend that those are approved by the commission before we issue our annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4342)|
| 1:12:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4355)|
| 1:12:37| Chris, on page one under the column for the $187 million, the last entry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4357)|
| 1:12:44| is that for the workers' comp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| The million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| And is that from the haul income tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| When you say income tax, what are you referring to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| Yes, and so basically what that would be is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| What we did is we decided, because the haul income tax exceeded what we had budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4379)|
| 1:13:08| so that estimation and appropriation came from the haul income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4388)|
| 1:13:12| So we just increased what we had budgeted for that fund so we could expense it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Next time maybe just put the word haul in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| So it doesn't appear that the governmental entity is paying $1.8 million in income tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4402)|
| 1:13:31| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| Okay, next item is 41 was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| Next item is item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| Madam Clerk, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| It's resolution 901, requesting the Tennessee Department of Transportation, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| to design and construct certain transportation improvements, including alignment, turn lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| and traffic signalization to the intersection of Fairview Road and Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| State Route 331 with Knox County, to procure all the necessary rights of way and easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4448)|
| 1:14:13| per the plans generated by TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4453)|
| 1:14:16| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Okay, motion to approve has been made by Commissioner Wright and seconded by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| All right, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Long overdue, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| The only reason why I pulled it, Commissioner Wright, was we had a very interesting meeting with TDOT just last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| I had the staff forward out the documents for it, so it's just I thought that would be good additional reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4482)|
| 1:14:48| that it can be a challenge to work with them to get all of our stuff on their list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| The issue at this intersection is that it's not aligned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| and at the other end of Fairview Road, TDOT currently has a project underway for signalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4501)|
| 1:15:09| and realignment of Fairview Road at Thompson School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| That's going to make Fairview Road in this section sort of a bypass, cloverleaf, cut through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4514)|
| 1:15:22| ever how you want to describe, missing Harbinson's Crossroads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4522)|
| 1:15:28| and there is already crash data at this location suggesting there should be some road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4528)|
| 1:15:38| In months gone by, I would like to thank Commission for already approving a swap in property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4538)|
| 1:15:46| between the local property owner and Knox County to get the right-of-way at this particular intersection primarily in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4546)|
| 1:15:55| There may be other issues on the other side of Tazewell Pike, but it's things that can be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4555)|
| 1:16:03| It's a group effort between local property owners there, us, Knox County, and then the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4563)|
| 1:16:10| Thank you, my fellow county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| All right, the next item before us we have is item number 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4585)|
| 1:16:32| Resolution 902, approving a qualified service organization agreement on coordination of substance use disorder treatment services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4592)|
| 1:16:40| between Cherokee Health Systems and the Knox Recovery Court and Veterans Treatment Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| Okay, a motion has been made by Commissioner Anders to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| It was seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| Is there anybody here to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4612)|
| 1:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| We may want to entertain a substitute motion to carry it over to the next week's meeting because your motion was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4625)|
| 1:17:14| Do we want to talk about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| I don't know who pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| I'm comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Well, Larson, this is the one you pulled, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| No, he pulled the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| Well, this is 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| I'm the one who pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| The main reason that I pulled it is I think we've made a big focus in this community about substance abuse, opiate addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4649)|
| 1:17:36| I guess I just wanted to make sure that the public knew that this is one of the many things that their local government is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4656)|
| 1:17:42| to help our community battle through these demons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| So I have absolutely no problem passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| I merely pulled it to call attention to it so that we're all aware that this is just one extra step that is happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| in particular the fact that these are services that are done for our veterans that are suffering from addiction-related disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| So, everyone, this is just something to pay attention to as we continue to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| Item number 44, resolution 903 is approving an amendment to the Knox County contract number 15-545| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4705)|
| 1:18:33| with the Aetna Life Insurance Company for group life insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| which amendment extends the term of the contract through December 31, 2020 and updates the pricing in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4717)|
| 1:18:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| Is there a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4727)|
| 1:18:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4728)|
| 1:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| The motion was made by Commissioner Anders and seconded by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| I see a light on by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| Mr. Jones, can you just talk a little bit about how often you go out to the marketplace to review as you're looking at this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4739)|
| 1:19:07| And this extends the contract and how often you go back and sort of review it against the marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Mark Jones, 400 Main Street, room 345.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4756)|
| 1:19:21| This is a group life insurance policy that was first put out to bid in 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4761)|
| 1:19:31| So this is for the years 16, 17, and 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| And so our recommendation would be that this be amended and renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4776)|
| 1:19:43| This is usually the typical contract that the county has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| It's for a three-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| And it has a one, two-year option to renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4789)|
| 1:19:53| So we usually, and maybe Matt Myers might want to address exactly how often we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4793)|
| 1:19:59| but it's usually a three-year contract with either one-year renewals for a total of five or one two-year renewal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4799)|
| 1:20:07| is the common practice for benefit contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Okay, this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| All opposed say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| Okay, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4827)|
| 1:20:29| Okay, the next item on our agenda for this evening is item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4829)|
| 1:20:39| That's line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| Second motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| There is a motion to send without recommendation by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| It was seconded by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| Is there any discussion that would like to happen tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| Okay, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4857)|
| 1:20:58| I'll go ahead and amend that recommendation to pull out the one-line item on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| Well, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4863)|
| 1:21:04| I was just going to send it up because there was a change in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| I didn't want to approve or disapprove tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4866)|
| 1:21:11| I would like to hear the situation on where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| We can do that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| I haven't read 150 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| We're pulling the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Sorry, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| We're pulling the resolution for the funding for the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4889)|
| 1:21:38| Where are we at with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| I don't see this conversation being had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| Page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| Page two of the line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| I don't know what we're talking about, but where are we at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| I know we're pulling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| There's no question of that, but what's the next steps, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| I'll go ahead and recognize Chris Caldwell, please, to shed a little bit of light on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| I know you all are well aware of the funding issue with BMX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4920)|
| 1:22:05| What we thought we would do is the mayor would like us to bring before commission next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| wait until October, and bring before you all the new budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| so broken down into phases, phase one and phase two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| and go over what phase one will cover and what phase two will cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| We're going to have PBA here to go over their project budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| and also visit Knoxville to go over the economic impact standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| Just to give you all a better understanding of where we are going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| and to show you that we're well aware that the $750,000 doesn't cover everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4957)|
| 1:22:45| So let's be transparent and show you what all that does cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| and the additional amount that is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| I'll give you a little sneak hint that the amount of that transfer means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4972)|
| 1:23:00| For us, it's a multiyear fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| and so we can postpone that transfer unlike the closeout funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| That's not an issue for us from an accounting standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| So it was just to be able to provide you all more information next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| as it relates to where BMX is and where it is going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Commissioner Andrews, your line is still up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5004)|
| 1:23:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Chris, on the line item transfers as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| At the end of the year last year, we had a bunch where it says department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| and it's finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5013)|
| 1:23:35| Wouldn't that be recreation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| So what we do at the end of every fiscal year, it's hard for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| and I'm not going to pick on departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| but it's hard for us to get departments to look at their accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| and fix what is negative from a legal standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5028)|
| 1:23:52| So what we try to do is go through and fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| Sometimes we can get them to sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Other times, from a time constraint, we'll sign it as we're trying to close the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| But if we get time for them to sign it and educate them, we try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5040)|
| 1:24:06| But sometimes we run into constraints of time and don't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| Well, I mean, it's very vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| It's buildings to improvements to non-buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5053)|
| 1:24:15| It would be easier to understand if we saw what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| So what department it comes from would be helpful at the top of the form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| We're revising that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| I talked to Commissioner Schoonmaker about that form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| and we're going to revise it, which I think will give you all some more clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| Because I know from our accounting world, a lot of times it's easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| because we just know org numbers and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| But I think we're also going to bring before the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5081)|
| 1:24:45| maybe a different way to look at the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| more like the state would do it compared to the level that we do it at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5090)|
| 1:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5094)|
| 1:24:57| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Okay, just I want to clarify exactly what we're voting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| The motion was made to send with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5103)|
| 1:25:07| We know that this is going to need to be modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5107)|
| 1:25:14| Mr. Law Director, is that the only motion we need to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| to verify that we're just sending with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| and then by next week's meeting we'll modify the actual motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| That motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5123)|
| 1:25:24| That motion to send with no recommendation is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| All opposed, say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5131)|
| 1:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| Next item that is before us, we have item number 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5137)|
| 1:25:47| Discussion item regarding a permanent early voting facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| in the North Knoxville Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5156)|
| 1:25:57| Motion to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5157)|
| 1:25:58| Point of order, there's no motion to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| No motion, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Yeah, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Go ahead, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5164)|
| 1:26:05| I'm going to let the person explain why I brought this up for the North Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5165)|
| 1:26:12| Cliff Rogers, Administrator of Elections for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Work Address 300 Main Street, Room 218.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5175)|
| 1:26:20| Mr. Chairman and Commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| my purpose in being here this evening is simply to begin a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| a very important discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| with you all about trying to identify and earmark some funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5188)|
| 1:26:32| to build a facility in the Powell community to be used for early voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| in each and every countywide election beginning in February 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5197)|
| 1:26:43| for the next presidential preference primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| And this is a perfect time to begin this discussion since this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| for the very first time ever in a countywide election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| we are compelled reluctantly, I might add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| to utilize three different early voting locations off of Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| Just think about that for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| From the perspective of a voter out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| three different early voting locations in a six-month time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| You think the voters will be confused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| Of course they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| And some of them will think that the Election Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| is carefully orchestrating chaos and confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| in an attempt to keep them from early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| It could certainly appear to a reasonable voter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| that we are bouncing them around like a pinball out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| I think that's how I might feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Well, let me give you a brief background about this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| so there's no erroneous speculation about what's happened to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| We started out this year in the Clinton Plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| for the Knox County primary election back in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| with the help of my friends at Hallrob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| That's exactly where we were for all three elections in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5268)|
| 1:27:52| However, we found out three weeks before early voting began for the August election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| basically at the very last minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| that the Clinton Plaza Shopping Center had gone into receivership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| The new landlord, a bank in New York City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| could care less about providing free space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| for the Election Commission to use for early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| In fact, from what I gathered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| the new landlord didn't even care about leasing space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| to new clients who were willing to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| Fortunately, our friend Tim Graham bailed us out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| and allowed us to use the Expo Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| for early voting in the August election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| Although, I might add, we were unable to vote there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| for the first two days of early voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5311)|
| 1:28:33| because of prior commitments at the Expo Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5313)|
| 1:28:36| And some voters were, of course, upset that we did not open there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5316)|
| 1:28:40| until what was, in effect, the third day of early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| However, this fall is a very busy time for the Expo Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| so that location wouldn't work for the upcoming November election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| So we hit the road again in North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| trying to locate a spot for early voting for that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| Fortunately, Gary Yow of Yow Properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| is allowing us to use a spot we located on Merchants Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| 314 Merchants Drive, Suite E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| and one we used back in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| So we got lucky. Again, real lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| We were very close to having no early voting spot in North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| So what we desperately need for the citizens and voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| who work and live out there is a permanent and suitable spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| owned by Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| which the Election Commission can use anytime we need it for early voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| Commissioner Bussler, a former election official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| is well aware of our problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5373)|
| 1:29:35| And to that end, Commissioner Bussler called me several weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| about trying to find a permanent solution to this early voting dilemma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| by identifying a suitable location in the Powell community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| Now, while I would admit that I would prefer an early voting spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5386)|
| 1:29:50| right on or closer to Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| a spot in Powell has considerable potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| as an early voting spot to serve those folks out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| because the county does not presently own a building on or about Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| and probably buying property out there is going to be a whole lot more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5404)|
| 1:30:08| So it didn't take me a very long time to drive to the Powell area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5408)|
| 1:30:13| from Clinton Highway after Commissioner Bussler and I spoke a few weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| And Commissioner Bussler and I do not think they'll take an exorbitant amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| to perhaps buy some property out there and to construct a suitable facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| so that the Election Commission could have a separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| therefore secure area in a building out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| in which to vote and safely store our voting equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| As I understand it, Commissioner Bussler is still getting some numbers together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| I think from riding our construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| so that you all will know more precisely at a later time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| what we need in money for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| But we really, really need a permanent location out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| Anyway, I'm going to stop and see if you all have any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5455)|
| 1:31:00| Okay. Commissioner Bussler, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Okay. What I want to say is I'm trying to find a facility out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5463)|
| 1:31:08| that will do a multi-use facility also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| We couldn't use or expand our community center out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| because we found out that the building that we have out there is in a floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| and we couldn't add on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5481)|
| 1:31:23| But I found another piece of property that we have out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| that is very reasonable where we could also expand the community center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5486)|
| 1:31:32| and have an election facility and it would be a multi-use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| at a much reasonable cost that we normally would spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| in a million or two million dollars for a community center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| And our community center out there runs that building by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| We don't pay any county employee to work it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| And all the funds, electricity and everything else is paid by the people out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| However, we did find a piece of property we're talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| and we're looking at to get and build a new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| that will expand into a permanent voting place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| and also can be used in multiple different ways when you're not using it to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5527)|
| 1:32:15| What we want from you all is permission to go ahead and start the process now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5535)|
| 1:32:22| that we have everything together so when the next physical year comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| we have the fundings, we can start at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| and we can have it open for the next election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| And that's why we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| I thought we had it all planned out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| but then Mr. Meyer showed me the evils of my ways of trying to get something done out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5557)|
| 1:32:43| so I had to look someplace else and did find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| And I think it's a good location and it would be easy for the voters to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| So anyway, this is what I was here for is to give you that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you, Commissioner Buschler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| Cliff, is there an opportunity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| I guess the Clinton Highway area is on the bus line that gives us a better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| I guess that's the reason you want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Is there something that we could lease down there that could possibly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| because I'm trying to quickly think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| There's not a reasonable close area there for a clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| or any other trustee's office or anything like that in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| So is there somewhere down there we could lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| kind of like we're doing downtown west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| but also have a trustee-clerk kind of occupancy along with you guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| I have no idea about what they might want to use out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| I just know after doing this for seven years that that, along with South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5622)|
| 1:33:48| but we've kind of got that under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| but out in North Knoxville has just been so problematic trying to find somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| We don't have suitable county facility out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| I'm talking about leasing a downtown west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| But downtown west, we had to do it because they were leasing all of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| There is property out there, but then doing it long term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5647)|
| 1:34:13| when we're in there just every other year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| downtown west we're at least voting people there all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| We don't vote in North Knoxville every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| It's just every even year that I don't know that you all, this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| can justify leasing it because they're going to want to do a long-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| Nobody wants to do short term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5670)|
| 1:34:31| You'd have to do a long-term lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| and I just don't know about trying to do that and finding the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| But is there property out there we could do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| Absolutely, we could probably do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| Well, if it's on the bus line, it'll be a city election as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| Well, we've never done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| I'm just saying the city of Knoxville tells us how they want to conduct their elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| and certainly if we had something out there, maybe the city would want to utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| But so far we only go with five early voting sites for city of Knoxville elections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5697)|
| 1:35:01| and that is not an area that they traditionally have us open out there, Commissioner, in order to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5701)|
| 1:35:08| But not saying we couldn't do it, just that we've never done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| But, again, those are city elections, and they tell us how to conduct that election for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| Yeah, I'm not opposed to what Charlie's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| I'm just, if you want one on the bus line, I think possible leasing a space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| and using dual purpose for it for a trustee and clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| I mean, because East Town's not that far away, but it's quite a drive for some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| Well, but we're already at New Harvest Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| so we've got our early voting site out there for all practical purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| I'm going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5737)|
| 1:35:38| I'm just talking about if you had a dual purpose facility on Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| the clerk could occupy that space and pay some rent, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| And that would be great as long as everybody understood that we have to have a secure part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| where we run everybody out but us during that early voting cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5749)|
| 1:35:53| and that just makes it tough when you're trying to lease a space, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| But I hear what you're saying, and certainly we're open to looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| but Commissioner Bussler certainly came up with an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| about maybe we just kind of move a little bit over to the Powell community and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| and I'm open to anything out there that would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| I agree with that, but I hope we're going through the proper process of requesting proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| and not picking spots on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| I think that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Very good. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| I'm not sure that Knox County, as it's our fiduciary duty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| and it's financially conservative that we start buying spots that we use so seldom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| I get Charlie's angle here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| He's trying to get into the community center in Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| and we would really like to have one in the third district, an area that is affected by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5802)|
| 1:36:47| and I think we disenfranchise the voters of Norwood, West Haven, Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5807)|
| 1:36:52| if we move from that location, that general area, out into the county farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| I think that's a consideration we need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| I hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| Mr. Rogers, can you tell me how many other permanent facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| does the Knox County Election Commission or Knox County have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Well, the way it works is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| If there is a county property, the Election Commission can take it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| and nobody can say no to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| That's the situation I like to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| which means that we get the Town of Farragut building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| We get New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| We get the Carnes Senior Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| We get this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| I'm probably missing one here off the top of my head, but-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5861)|
| 1:37:43| John T. Mascott Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5863)|
| 1:37:45| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5865)|
| 1:37:46| Excuse me, Carter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| Yes, Carter Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| They have to give it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| But the other ones, we're kind of at the mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| Love Kitchen has been great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| South Knoxville, as you know, we've got a church out there now that we work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Downtown West, we've got a long-term lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| so we're in good shape out there as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| Given exactly what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| aren't there ample opportunities to find churches in the same area that you're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| to partner with on long-term leases or agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| We have a Powell Library that's big and beautiful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5901)|
| 1:38:24| It seems before we start building buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| I would agree with Commissioner Smith that we ought to look for the partnerships that work in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| We're not proposing to build a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| We're partnering with a church on a long-term location and a lease in Downtown West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| and it seems like this is a lot more than just using it for a few days and finding a permanent home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| This is a capital expenditure that's going to require a tremendous amount of maintenance and upkeep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5926)|
| 1:38:51| and I just think that we ought to look at the options that are working in other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| before we start on a different option of building assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| I hear you, but I want to be very clear about one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| This church situation is problematic every go-around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5940)|
| 1:39:05| They have to vote on it after every election to decide whether we're getting that spot back or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| And I sit there holding my breath, hoping that nothing's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5952)|
| 1:39:16| that nothing has made that church mad in the May election when we went to August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| and nothing in the August as we went into November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| I have no idea whether they're going to want us there for city elections or in the elections coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5964)|
| 1:39:29| I have no control over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| I'm like you. I like control over stuff, and I have no control over a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| And as far as the churches out there, we talked to the, I think it's Wallace Baptist Church out there off of Merchants Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5976)|
| 1:39:44| They've got a child daycare center in there, so they said absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| It presents security issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| And every church is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| One of them I have to deal with the pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5993)|
| 1:39:55| He has the right to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5995)|
| 1:39:56| Of course, you get a new pastor and it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Other ones I deal with the Board of Deacons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| The one in South Knoxville, the entire congregation votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| So every election I'm just sitting there hoping that, golly, I hope something doesn't fall apart where we get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6004)|
| 1:40:10| So there's no easy solution to this is my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| Well, and I understand that perhaps the church side of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6013)|
| 1:40:16| but Downtown West is a long-term lease on a space that was essentially vacant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6016)|
| 1:40:21| that you found a good term with them from Knox County to create a permanent lease space, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6021)|
| 1:40:27| Clinton Highway is half empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6027)|
| 1:40:30| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| So it would seem to me that we would spend all of our time and effort to try to find a permanent space that we might lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| and be fiduciarily responsible versus building a brand-new building before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| I just feel like we ought to exhaust that option before we decide to build a new structure that is owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| and have to be maintained by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| Well, like I said, this is the beginning of a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| But if I don't bring it in to focus, I'm out here just floundering around by myself out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| and nobody really understands how it goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| And I want everybody to be in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| It's a fair statement, and I think that you're right to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| The idea of bouncing around continuously is not the right thing to do for the voters of our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| And so I would agree with trying to find a permanent space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| but I would encourage you and others to start focusing on long-term leases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| or places where we're going to have permanent lease space versus building new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6087)|
| 1:41:29| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| I want to echo some of the sentiments that has been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| And I appreciate that the Powell is a valued community, but it's not the entire district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| And could you talk to a short-term or long-term lease in terms of what number of years is a long-term lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6102)|
| 1:41:50| versus a short-term lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| I don't really feel comfortable looking at the entire assessment of our election window of saying we need one area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| over another area, and we value and appreciate the Love Kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| but that service is very limited in terms of the scope of what the community there needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| And I know we have John T. O'Connor Center for our election cycle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| but I would like to understand, especially when people don't have access to the bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| how that will impact the larger needs of the community that would like to participate in the election process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| What window is a long-term lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| What would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| Well, I mean, long-term is what we have at Downtown West.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| That's simply five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| A short-term lease, most of the commercial developers that I talk to, nobody's interested in a short-term lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6155)|
| 1:42:43| I can't get a lease for just a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| If they have something, they give it to us for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| That's traditionally what they've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| And that's why I'm out there begging for places to vote, and I've got no money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| And it's really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| And if I didn't have personal relationships with so many of these commercial developers here in town who will return my call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6177)|
| 1:43:04| at least I can get the conversation started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| But the landlords don't always live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6186)|
| 1:43:08| They're in another state, and they have very little motive to do anything for free here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| It's probably the most frustrating, I won't say the most, but it's right up there in terms of frustrating aspects of this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| It's trying to get early voting situations to serve as many people as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| And you all have heard me say it, and I've gone on TV before, and I'll say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| I don't want to see one person on election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| I want it so easy for early voting, everybody can vote early or absentee by mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| All of my problems are on election day, so I am trying to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| And the commission is trying to serve all the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6221)|
| 1:43:45| And if you all have got any ideas or solutions, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| I follow up on every one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6230)|
| 1:43:52| I can promise you that because I want this easier for us and for the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| so they know where we're going to be from one election to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6237)|
| 1:44:02| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| Do we use Crown College on election day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| And that's a recent development, and I reached out to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| I reached out to them about trying to do early voting there in this next election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| but because the room where they have and where they want us had already been leased out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| for several of the days during early voting, it just wouldn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| We can't be there for three days, get out for two, go back in for three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| So I did reach out to them as a possible solution once we had the problem with the Clinton Plaza out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6270)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6280)|
| 1:44:41| Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| Mr. Smith hasn't been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| He's been once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| I certainly understand the situation that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| and I appreciate Commissioner Boesler being proactive on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6296)|
| 1:45:02| but I just want to reemphasize what Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6302)|
| 1:45:07| The Clinton Highway Plaza actually affects District 2 and District 3 very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6307)|
| 1:45:17| We've got Harvest Park, and that really takes a lot of your 7th District, 8th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| some of your 1st and 2nd Districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6324)|
| 1:45:28| So to move all the way from the Clinton Highway area right there all the way out to, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6328)|
| 1:45:37| Emery Road at Powell, where we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| that leaves a big void for all of your Inskip area and your Pleasant Ridge and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6340)|
| 1:45:49| So I think whatever we need to do is to put out the fillers out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| and try to find something that stays in that Pleasant Ridge-Clinton Highway zone area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6355)|
| 1:46:01| and that Northwest area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| I guess I would want to call it Northwest area right there as to have an early voting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6364)|
| 1:46:13| Then I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| If we need another one out more in the Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| But I think we need to really focus on that Northwest area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6384)|
| 1:46:25| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| I know, Randy, you've been called once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| Let me speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6391)|
| 1:46:34| How many of you all have run an election facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| You can't understand the complaints that you get when they are used to voting in one area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6400)|
| 1:46:48| Now, you've got to get voters in a habit that they know that this is from now on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6408)|
| 1:46:55| this is where it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Now, you've got a five-year lease down west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| Will you be able to renew that five-year lease when it's over with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6419)|
| 1:47:03| Somebody mentioned the Powell Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| Go out there and take a look at the room that you have to hold the election in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| You can't get far enough away from the machines to be legal from the recorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| and people coming in and out of that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| It's not big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| The parking is not there, and they don't facilitate for parking for voting at the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6438)|
| 1:47:28| Why I said this out here, and I talked to Cliff and I was going to tell you all about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| the Powell Community Center, I'm proud of that thing because it's small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| it's run by the community, and they take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| But they're running out the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| Now, we do the Veterans Affair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| We had over 160-something there this past Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| The seniors meet there that day that they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| They have over 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| All this other stuff that's going on out there, we're busting out the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| I wanted to add a little room on the Powell Community Center to take care of voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| but we can't do that because it's in a building of a flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| Now, we've got a piece of property out there that just can be used to expand a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6488)|
| 1:48:18| and we're not talking a million dollars or two million dollars for a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| like everybody else has in their communities and where they build out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| but it would be the money that we could afford to build it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| and it would be there from now on out, and people will know where they can vote at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6511)|
| 1:48:36| Right now, they don't know, not even at NSKIP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| You don't have it out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| If you even get a lease long term, five years after five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| what if the demand on the property is more and you have to move again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6525)|
| 1:48:51| What are you going to tell the voters then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| I mean, you're going to say, oh, we could only have this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| Now we're going to move it again, and you know what they're going to think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| We're trying to keep them from voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| You know, you have people in my area out there that's so entrenched on what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6542)|
| 1:49:09| you move the hour in which you have a meeting out there by an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| because there's some reason that you can't get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| they're upset because it's not open at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| And the thing here is being consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| Are you going to be consistent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| Are you going to do a lease for five years and then have to move it after five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| You've got an opportunity here for a piece of property we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| or are going to have that is very inexpensive right now that we can get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| and we can build a block building, not one of these fancy brick buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| with everything else on it, that we can use for voting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6584)|
| 1:49:47| and an additional use for the community out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| So not only will you have it for the voting, which Cliff will have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6590)|
| 1:49:54| I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say it, Mr. Rogers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| I mean, you are running an election and trying to make sure the voters vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| You're telling me, and by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| we've got an opportunity to help solve and get a stable voting place out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| If we need to run a bus out there, let's find a way of running a bus out there on election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| But let's don't go out here and spend three to four million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| to build a building someplace just for the voting and a one-place use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| I'm not talking about that kind of money, and neither are we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6623)|
| 1:50:26| We're trying to get a budget in here to take care of it cheaply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| so people can vote regularly at a particular building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| And like you say, if you want to run a bus, let's lease a bus those days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| and say it's going to run out there on these times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| It would be less expensive on us and much better response to our community by doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| than sitting here saying, well, I need it here or I need it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| But the people that vote want to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and they want to vote consistently where they normally vote at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| Let's show the citizens that we really want them to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| Have a vote in our election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6660)|
| 1:51:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6664)|
| 1:51:05| We are spending a lot of time on this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| so I want to ask my commissioners to add things that we haven't heard yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| So go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| Commissioner Bussler, you have parks, you have community centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6675)|
| 1:51:17| you have a lot of assets for the people of Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| The people of the 3rd District have one tiny little park, no community center, no senior center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| So if we're going to build a facility that is going to be used just for voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| that can be used as a multipurpose building, I think we need to look in the 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6689)|
| 1:51:35| Mr. Rogers, I know I work with you in locating these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| not in locating but helping on one aspect of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| Do we pay for these leases, these short-term leases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| The only time that we have paid for it has been with the church out at Meridian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6707)|
| 1:51:52| where we pay them $200 a day, that's what we pay for election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6712)|
| 1:51:56| Everything else for the last seven years, to the best of my ability and knowledge, has been for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| And that makes it really tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| And even for $200 a day, for a lot of commercial realtors, they could care less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6727)|
| 1:52:12| They just look at it as community service if they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| So that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| There's no short-term leases, and that's really election-by-election lease there in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6736)|
| 1:52:21| Would it help if we did offer some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6741)|
| 1:52:23| That would certainly be cheaper than building a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6743)|
| 1:52:25| And is there any way we as a commission could probably give a property tax incentive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| to some landlord or a property owner for this short-term use of their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| Well, that's beyond my ability to answer about the tax break or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6754)|
| 1:52:39| but I'm in favor of anything that will motivate the landlords.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| But the problem is it's all shifting targets out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| These shopping centers are owned by one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| At this point in time, I have an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| Then by the time I get around to the next one, somebody else owned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| and it ends up being in receivership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6773)|
| 1:52:55| And remember, this is just one little one I've got going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| I've got all of this going on at the early voting sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| and I've got all the drama on election day at polling places, things moving around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6781)|
| 1:53:06| So anyway, I don't know how else to answer you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6786)|
| 1:53:10| I can tell you this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| You all talk about what you're going to tell voters in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| I ain't going to be doing this job in five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| I'll tell you that for the record right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| It's going to need a younger man some point on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6798)|
| 1:53:23| Mr. Rogers, I've got a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Are we looking at stuff by bus lines and things of that nature or specific square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| something like the Norwood Library that is located in the third district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| Is that kind of what we're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| Bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6817)|
| 1:53:38| That library ain't going to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| Listen, if it wasn't the Carter community, that library wouldn't work in other areas of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| But libraries traditionally don't have a secure room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| I tried to find one of those in South Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| We had to shut down the whole library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| And I guarantee you, the library folks aren't going to like me at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| And the people that use those libraries, the senior groups, they hate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| This is why it's an appointed position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| I just make people mad all day long doing this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| And I try not to step on too many toes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| But the libraries have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| There's not enough parking down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| And I can't judge in advance how many people are coming on what day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| although the voters think I'm supposed to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| Is there a specific amount of square feet we should look for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| Well, usually you get into that 1,800 square feet where we can get set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6861)|
| 1:54:28| But then I need a separate room where I can lock the machines at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| I need a place where my workers can have a little kitchen area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| You've got to have bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6875)|
| 1:54:36| Some of these spots, people say, go down there and look at this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| It's got a leaking roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| It needs plumbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6879)|
| 1:54:40| It needs electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6880)|
| 1:54:41| I'm going to spend all that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| and then I don't even get to use it the next election cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| It's a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6885)|
| 1:54:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| And Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| I kind of agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6891)|
| 1:54:52| This has kind of gone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| You might want to consider calling a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| where the Election Commission can sit down with us, show us maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| show us costs, show us what their needs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| so we have a little bit more accurate information to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6905)|
| 1:55:10| Because I'd like to know exactly what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6910)|
| 1:55:13| That could be something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| I'm beginning to formulate a schedule of chairman's briefings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| and I think with the energy behind this topic, that would be interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6917)|
| 1:55:24| I was just talking to Drew about that earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| about getting all of our space reserved and laying out a schedule for the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| Based on the energy I've seen in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| you can count on that being a topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| Mr. Rogers, Commissioner's briefing is when we have a non-voting meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| dedicated to one topic where we will drill down in great detail and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| kind of like what we've done today on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| Stay tuned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6950)|
| 1:55:51| We'll get that on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6951)|
| 1:55:53| 2019, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| It will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6957)|
| 1:55:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| The next item for discussion is item number 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6962)|
| 1:56:08| Go ahead, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Discussion item regarding float protection in new subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6974)|
| 1:56:15| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| That's item 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| I want to move on with no recommendation since Mr. Green is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| And no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6986)|
| 1:56:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| We can move that to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6990)|
| 1:56:32| We can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| We can have that as a question item for when we're in zoning next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6997)|
| 1:56:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| The next item is item 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| That's a discussion item regarding physical fitness tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| And, Commissioner Bussler, that was one that you asked for discussion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7009)|
| 1:56:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| I've given you all and handed out to you all this information about this tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7011)|
| 1:56:59| that was passed by the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| And it comes October the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| It goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| We're talking about having people healthy, work out, and things of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7026)|
| 1:57:11| Yet we have our state legislators want to tax your working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7031)|
| 1:57:17| They want to tax your sweat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| Taxes are regressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7041)|
| 1:57:22| They're not progressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| They don't encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7043)|
| 1:57:24| They discourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| And I just brought this up to let people know when you're voting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| remember the state passes laws like this to tax your ability to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7049)|
| 1:57:38| I'm serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| Isn't that crazy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| Isn't that stupid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7060)|
| 1:57:42| I mean, to me it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| If you want somebody healthy, you encourage them to work out and be healthier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| But I just want to bring that up and just say, hey, guys in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| look at what you're doing to the people out here in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7077)|
| 1:57:58| Thank you for bringing that to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7078)|
| 1:57:59| Commissioner Skinmaker, you've got any add on to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Commissioner Buster, it's my understanding that this tax has already been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| if a health club has a square footage less than 15,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7086)|
| 1:58:13| and that if the health club, which is usually a local-owned entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| probably going to be less than 15,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| they also pay the 9.25% tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| But if it's also located within the city limits of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7106)|
| 1:58:30| they pay the additional 4.5% amusement tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7110)|
| 1:58:35| So to me, what the state has done previously is allowed outside entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7115)|
| 1:58:42| corporations outside of Tennessee to get basically a tax break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7122)|
| 1:58:46| but yet the local entities are being taxed, and I don't think that is fair at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| But currently, if you have a membership in a health club in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| and it's less than 15,000 square feet in size, you are paying tax on that membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| But if you read the whole act right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| if you hire somebody in that facility as a trainer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| the trainers are taxed for you working out with a trainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7153)|
| 1:59:18| And really the only thing that's really not covered under that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| that they can't tax you on or what they didn't put in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7161)|
| 1:59:24| is somebody that plays tennis and wants to get trained physically for tennis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| I don't know what the big deal is about tennis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| There must be a lot of people down there playing tennis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7170)|
| 1:59:33| Speaker of the House, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| Oh, sorry, Speaker, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7174)|
| 1:59:36| Okay, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7176)|
| 1:59:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Let's not be picking on the state legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| Well, we've got a couple of months that we can get at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| I reviewed this letter just today at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7186)|
| 1:59:51| not being distributed by Commissioner Bussler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| but by being handed to me by my stylist or my makeup artist or my spouse or my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7196)|
| 2:00:10| Pat received this letter in the mail saying that Tenova Health and Fitness and Pal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7210)|
| 2:00:16| will now have to charge her sales tax on all the services provided to her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7216)|
| 2:00:23| at the Pal location of Tenova Health and Fitness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| an issue that she's not dealt with for the past 8 or 10 or 12 years that she's been a member there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7228)|
| 2:00:38| The leading health issues in the state of Tennessee are opioids, smoking, and obesity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7238)|
| 2:00:49| and charging sales tax to people that want to go and sweat, to me, sounds like it's counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7249)|
| 2:00:59| I know what she's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| She's going to cancel her membership on this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| So is that productive in the state of Tennessee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| I think not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| And I'd almost be to the point of saying we, Knox County Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7272)|
| 2:01:19| should consider maybe a letter to the state in the form of a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7279)|
| 2:01:27| saying that we oppose the implementation of this sales tax from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7287)|
| 2:01:38| Thank you, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| I might add one personal take I have on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| You all may remember at last month's meeting when I had someone come in to say the grace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| from my men's group called F3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7307)|
| 2:01:51| This is a grassroots men's and women's fitness group, and all the workouts are free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7311)|
| 2:01:58| and we've got locations throughout Knox County and always looking to plant different workout groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7318)|
| 2:02:05| I would see groups like that for men and women who want to get great workouts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7325)|
| 2:02:10| and not have to bother about paying anything or taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7330)|
| 2:02:13| It just had to put in a plug-in for that particular group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| I appreciate your plug for that group, but what does that do for Tenova?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| Next steps, we should probably consider a resolution on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7344)|
| 2:02:32| This meeting is getting long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| Go ahead, Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7355)|
| 2:02:36| I was just going to say that the sad part is with the state of Tennessee this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7356)|
| 2:02:41| having a surplus of $703 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7361)|
| 2:02:45| this just is insane that they would tax the people that are trying to get healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7365)|
| 2:02:51| It just is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7371)|
| 2:02:56| To tell you about the, excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7379)|
| 2:03:00| I'd go say Commissioner Jay, then Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| I'm just trying to figure out why we're spending time on something that's a state of Tennessee tax issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7384)|
| 2:03:09| You don't have to get taxed to go out and work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| Go walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| I just don't understand why we would spend our time on something that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| if you want to send this to the Legislative Affairs Committee to have a discussion with our state leaders, go for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7396)|
| 2:03:21| but to spend time doing a resolution saying we don't want our gym membership tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7401)|
| 2:03:26| It's a goods and services, and they can decide that as they will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| but I just can't figure out why we're spending our time on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| instead of sending it to our Legislative Affairs Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7412)|
| 2:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7414)|
| 2:03:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7415)|
| 2:03:36| Go ahead, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7416)|
| 2:03:37| Well, the one thing that you're elected for as county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| as I was told, you have the fiduciary responsibility of the taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7421)|
| 2:03:48| Now, if we don't let the state know, it's not a big deal to some of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7428)|
| 2:03:54| but it is a big deal that the state can tax anything that they want to and can be counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7434)|
| 2:04:03| That's all we want to send a message for, and like you say, it's not a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| but there's a lot of tax dollars they will be collecting off of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7449)|
| 2:04:12| and they could have done one thing that would have taken care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7452)|
| 2:04:15| Number one, they could have passed a resolution or a law that did away with the original law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7455)|
| 2:04:23| instead of incorporating everybody in there, but they wouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| And the reason why they wouldn't do it is they couldn't get everybody down there to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7467)|
| 2:04:33| to operate on less tax dollars from what they're already receiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7473)|
| 2:04:38| And to me, that's a slap in the face of the taxpayers, even though it's a minor thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7484)|

| 2:05:24| which we should have back within a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7524)|

| 2:05:52| that could be great for tourism in Knox County, given all the things that we have to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| Is there any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7560)|

| 2:07:31| to your already strong position in the sports tourism industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7651)|

| 2:07:58| On top of that, I wanted to comment about visit Knoxville in the last three years has done a phenomenal job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7678)|
| 2:08:05| of putting together a sports commission where a lot of things are already happening and things are in the works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7685)|
| 2:08:11| And so there's multiple AAU volleyball and basketball courts that we've purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7691)|

| 2:08:24| There's more tournaments coming this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7704)|

| 2:08:32| and I hope that this is just an extension of that as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7712)|
| 2:08:37| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7717)|
| 2:08:38| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7721)|
| 2:08:42| I gave you or put out a report of how you reserve some fields through the Parks and Rec Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7722)|
| 2:08:53| and a certain type that you, how you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7733)|
| 2:08:57| Now, read that real carefully, and we might want to look at the policies on how these fields are reserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| and see if they're being discriminatory against certain groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| and we just need to look at that because I've had complaints from people from out of town coming in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7748)|
| 2:09:14| and trying to use our facilities as doing regional tournaments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| and that's what you want, people to come in here and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| So, anyway, we just need to look at that and review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| and then have it a discussion item down the road before we get deep into developing fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| and that's sort of like baseball and softball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| I just want to follow up on what Brad was saying about the Visit Knoxville and the sports commission that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7775)|
| 2:09:40| They have done an excellent job with the limited resources they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7780)|
| 2:09:44| It would be quite amazing what they could do if they had adequate support and assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7790)|
| 2:09:51| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7791)|
| 2:09:52| Is there any other discussion on this topic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| Okay, the next and final item that we have, actually, excuse me, we did have two ads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| We do have, we're on item 57, which is a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7800)|
| 2:10:04| It's a discussion item regarding the upcoming ethics committee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7804)|
| 2:10:10| I've got a memo from the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| Basically, I'll read to you for the record the memo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| but we are going to be appointing another person to the ethics committee at the upcoming October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7817)|
| 2:10:24| Please be advised that the term of Jonathan Cooper on the Knox County Ethics Committee expires October 31, 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7824)|
| 2:10:31| Mr. Cooper is serving as one of Knox County Commission's citizen appointments to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7831)|
| 2:10:36| Pursuant to the Knox County Code of Ethics, members of the ethics committee are permitted to serve only one full four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7836)|

| 2:10:47| However, if no qualified person is interested in filling a vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| then an ethics committee member is permitted to serve a second four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| Next paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7855)|
| 2:10:57| Please note that the Knox County Code of Ethics requires notice of all vacancies on the ethics committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| to be published in a newspaper of general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7863)|
| 2:11:06| In addition, citizen members on the ethics committee must be citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7866)|

| 2:11:26| Please make the necessary arrangements for the commission to appoint, at its regular October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7886)|
| 2:11:32| one new citizen member to the ethics committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7892)|
| 2:11:36| Thank you for the attention to this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7896)|
| 2:11:38| If you should have any questions, please feel free to contact me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7898)|
| 2:11:41| That was from our law director to me regarding this important appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7901)|
| 2:11:49| We basically are going to need to make sure this gets posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7909)|
| 2:11:54| We need to accept applications, which will be shared with all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7914)|
| 2:11:58| and then schedule a public forum here to interview the candidates at our October meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7918)|
| 2:12:06| I'll open the floor up for discussion on this matter, but that's the outcome that we want to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7926)|
| 2:12:11| Thank you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker, did they get the rules, changes, did they get all that complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| I'd hate for Mr. Cooper to start that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| Is that all complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| Yes, we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7941)|
| 2:12:23| Okay, just making sure that we're done with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7943)|
| 2:12:25| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| Yes, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7947)|
| 2:12:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| What will be the deadline for resumes, applications, the process forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| so that people just outline the procedural aspect of what that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| Procedurally, I know we're going to have to post that this position is open in newspaper general circulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7960)|
| 2:12:47| I believe Drew will handle that in the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7967)|
| 2:12:51| The application will be to send their resume or letter requesting this appointment to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| In turn, as soon as those come in, Drew will be forwarding those applications to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7977)|
| 2:13:04| As far as I'm considered, we could probably take those up to the day of our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7984)|
| 2:13:11| because we might get a strong candidate that could come in at least the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7991)|
| 2:13:16| That will give us a chance to review their resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| and then have any person who would like to be considered will come to a specially called meeting that day of our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8000)|
| 2:13:29| for us to interview them and then do a vote on who we'll appoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8009)|
| 2:13:35| I'm seeing a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| Has that helped clarify just a little bit, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8016)|
| 2:13:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8019)|
| 2:13:40| Yeah, for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| Go ahead, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| I believe there are also appointments to be made by the mayor to this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| so there might be a need for some coordination of making sure that whoever applies also is known by the other body to have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8029)|
| 2:13:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8039)|
| 2:14:00| I see the mayor is here and his staff, and we will work with you all on this particular opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| There was another light here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| I thought, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8047)|
| 2:14:08| Procedurally, I would prefer that their resume be in before when the work session agenda is released,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8048)|
| 2:14:14| and that's kind of the cutoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8054)|
| 2:14:16| Anybody can nominate from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| I would prefer a cutoff of that when the agenda is released, if that's okay with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8058)|
| 2:14:25| There's nothing illegal about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| That's what I would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8067)|
| 2:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| Looking at the calendar here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8071)|
| 2:14:34| It would be the Thursday before she sends it out, Thursday before the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| So the work session is going to be on October 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8078)|
| 2:14:43| The cutoff then would be the 11th of October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8083)|
| 2:14:52| Drusilla, can you get this posted within the next two days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8092)|
| 2:14:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| So if we got this posted, today is the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| We should get it posted and run really for the next three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8104)|
| 2:15:11| That should give us the opportunity, and frankly, a lot of this is going to be word of mouth, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8111)|
| 2:15:15| within our community here on commission to encourage community leaders to apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| So if it's acceptable to this body, we could accept resumes through the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8121)|
| 2:15:29| On the night of our leave on the work session, which is on the 15th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8129)|
| 2:15:36| we can have the interviews take place either at 6 o'clock or as soon as the conclusion of our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8136)|
| 2:15:43| if that's acceptable to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8143)|
| 2:15:46| I would do 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8146)|
| 2:15:49| It is 7.16 right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| So would that be acceptable to this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| I'm looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8155)|
| 2:15:56| I'm seeing heads nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| Okay, so the plan will be we will have the interviews take place at 6.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| the night of our October work session, or as soon as the work session is concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8165)|
| 2:16:11| So 6.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| If we wrap up a little bit before then, that might give us a ten-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8172)|
| 2:16:18| Does that sound good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8178)|
| 2:16:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8180)|
| 2:16:21| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8181)|
| 2:16:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8182)|
| 2:16:23| I guess a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8183)|
| 2:16:25| We can still take nominations up to the day of the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| You can take a nomination from the floor as you're nominating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8190)|
| 2:16:36| So we can do the interviews, but there may be a person nominated that went through an interview is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8196)|
| 2:16:42| That could be possible, but that's a policy issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8202)|
| 2:16:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| You know what, I'd like to go ahead and just have a vote on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| or at least a show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| You can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8215)|
| 2:16:56| All right, we can't vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| All right, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| You set that up as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8220)|
| 2:17:01| I'll set it up as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| But my intention is to do, as we've discussed, to set that up for a 6.30 vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8222)|
| 2:17:06| to have the applications due by the 11th so we'll have them by the 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8226)|
| 2:17:10| And I'm seeing, generally speaking, all the heads are nodding at me, so I think that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8230)|
| 2:17:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| Moving on on our agenda, Item 58.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| This is a discussion item brought to us by Commissioner Schoonmaker about our Legislative Committee on Affairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| I want to give you a quick update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| First, we are very fortunate to have Representative Bill Dunn as part of our Knoxville delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8251)|
| 2:17:40| And, of course, most of you know he's the senior member now in the House of Representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| This summer I presented a proposal to him, and he considered it and agreed with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| and took it to the House Legal Office in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8273)|
| 2:17:58| He then went to the House Clerk's Office and spoke to them about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8278)|
| 2:18:03| and then spoke with Speaker Beth Harwell about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8283)|
| 2:18:08| The initiative was to make it easier for citizens to navigate the Tennessee General Assembly website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8288)|
| 2:18:16| and make language easier to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| So, as a result of that, this morning at 10 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| House Speaker Beth Harwell sent a letter to all of her members of the House of Representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| adopting this new access to the Tennessee General Assembly website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8311)|
| 2:18:37| Basically, they're going to move to put amendments on the website after it's approved by a subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8317)|
| 2:18:45| even though it's not been formally voted on by a full committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8325)|
| 2:18:49| so that people can understand what actually the bill is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8329)|
| 2:18:53| This is going to make it not only beneficial to our own Legislative Affairs Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8333)|
| 2:18:58| but it's going to make a great opportunity for all county mayors, all county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| all associations across the state of Tennessee, even the lobbyists, as well as the trade groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8343)|
| 2:19:09| So I really commend Bill Dunn for taking the bull by the horns and going to task for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8349)|
| 2:19:17| because he really did an awesome job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8357)|
| 2:19:20| If you're a bulldog, you can get things done, so I really appreciate him doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8360)|
| 2:19:26| But I was thankful he sent me the information from Speaker Harwell this morning on what the resolution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8366)|
| 2:19:33| So they're going to continue to make improvements to make access to the Tennessee General Assembly website much easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8373)|
| 2:19:41| John, thank you for taking that proactive approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| That's going to help a lot of Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| I think that's a good extension of the leadership you've been exhibiting on our Finance Committee as the leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8386)|
| 2:19:51| and bringing a lot of the state-related financial information to us on the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8391)|
| 2:19:57| That is appreciated, and thank you for taking that additional follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8397)|
| 2:20:02| So I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8402)|
| 2:20:04| Okay, the next item is Item Number 59 in the order of tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8404)|
| 2:20:12| It's the Joint Education Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| Okay, was that Larson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8417)|
| 2:20:18| I'm happy to serve on the Joint Education Committee along with Commissioners Gill, Smith, and Carringer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| and I have been in contact with Terry Hill, the chairperson for the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8425)|
| 2:20:32| and have put some dates on our forum to look at and agreed to just sort of help coordinate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8432)|
| 2:20:39| once we can agree on a couple of dates that work for all of us in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| They will cross-reference that and pick a date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| and we will at that meeting then set the agenda for the rest of the year and then next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8447)|
| 2:20:52| and everybody's looking forward to working together on some more regularity and discussion together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8452)|
| 2:20:57| So things are underway, and if you would all look at the forum, then we'll get moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8462)|
| 2:21:04| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8464)|
| 2:21:06| That concludes our regularly scheduled agenda for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8466)|
| 2:21:10| I'm sure there might be some announcements by Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| Before we do that, though, I do want to check and see if there have been any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8473)|
| 2:21:17| I haven't noticed anyone coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| I haven't been contacted, but is there anyone from the public who would like to address County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8478)|
| 2:21:26| Is there anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8486)|
| 2:21:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8488)|
| 2:21:29| Any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8489)|
| 2:21:31| All right, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8491)|
| 2:21:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8493)|
| 2:21:34| Not really an announcement, more of just a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| I would like to let Mayor Jacobs know that I appreciate his initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| to have your senior staff down here front and center so we can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| As a commissioner for three and a half years, it was always difficult for me in this spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8507)|
| 2:21:51| to actually see in the shadows along the back wall where most of the senior staff would hide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8511)|
| 2:21:57| and we couldn't really identify who that individual is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8517)|
| 2:22:01| And I appreciate you suggesting to your staff that they be down here in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8521)|
| 2:22:06| and be proud to be part of your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8526)|
| 2:22:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8532)|
| 2:22:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8533)|
| 2:22:14| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8534)|
| 2:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8535)|
| 2:22:16| The Asst. Commissioner will be at Gap Creek Market this month on September 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8536)|
| 2:22:22| Change of time, it's going to be like 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8542)|
| 2:22:27| And I'd like to get Dr. Buchanan, she's still here, come down and tell us about flu shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| I think we've got a couple of dates this week or is it next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467180917?start=8552)|
