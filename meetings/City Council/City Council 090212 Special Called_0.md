| 0:00:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=0)|
| 0:00:03| We're going to go ahead and call this meeting to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3)|
| 0:00:05| This is a special called meeting of City Council for the purpose of electing a new council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=5)|
| 0:00:11| for the 6th Councilmanic District to replace the Vice Mayor, Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=11)|
| 0:00:16| And in getting the meeting started, we'll go ahead and call on Council Member Pelow to deliver the invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=16)|
| 0:00:24| And if Mr. Woodhull would lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=24)|
| 0:00:28| If you will all stand, please, and let's bow our heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=28)|
| 0:00:34| Our Father, we come together tonight with a very special task of determining who could best serve the 6th District of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=34)|
| 0:00:52| We feel a great compulsion to give every consideration to every individual who has come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=52)|
| 0:01:02| and in a sense volunteered to take that very important spot on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=62)|
| 0:01:10| We pray that you will be with us as we hear each person bring to us what special talents they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=70)|
| 0:01:22| that would be a contribution not only to the council but as an advocate for their 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=82)|
| 0:01:31| We pray that you'll be with us during these deliberations and may we all find our way home safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=105)|
| 0:01:58| Well, let me start off by admitting that I am not Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=118)|
| 0:02:10| And the mayor extends his apologies for not being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| He had to be out of town today and hoped that he might be back in time to chair the meeting tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=133)|
| 0:02:18| But, unfortunately, he's not going to be able to be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| And so council has asked their attorney to preside over this meeting so we can move things along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=141)|
| 0:02:31| I want everyone to know that council has worked very hard to put together a process for this election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| that is fair to those who wish to be considered for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| I think that has been the ultimate goal that the members of council have really sought in putting together this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=166)|
| 0:02:54| to do something that's fair to everyone who wishes to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| And so we have tried hard to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| Hopefully, this process will have an appearance of objective fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=182)|
| 0:03:07| Now, any time that you have a position where seven folks have applied for the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=187)|
| 0:03:13| and only one person can be selected for that position, there's going to be some subjective unfairness to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| Those who do not get selected to the position are going to feel in some way that that was unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=199)|
| 0:03:25| Hopefully, even those who do not get selected to the position will be able to see that council has worked very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| to put together a fair process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| and given everyone a fair opportunity to be heard with regard to their qualifications in regard to this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| I think council would also like for me to say to everyone who has filed an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=222)|
| 0:03:47| and is here tonight to be considered for this important position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| that they very much appreciate your willingness to put your name forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| They recognize, perhaps more than anybody in this city, the sacrifice that is involved for public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=235)|
| 0:04:04| that putting your name up for public service is not an easy thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| And the willingness to do that by those who have come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| and submitted their application for this is something that's really great for this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| And they want you all to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| And they want you to know, regardless of the outcome of this election tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| that they very much appreciate everything that you do for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| and everything that you are willing to do by submitting your names for consideration for this position in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| Having said that, I would like to call on Ms. Mitchell to call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=275)|
| 0:04:41| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Councilman Pillow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| Councilman Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Eight members of council being present, we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| But the ground rules one more time for how this process will follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| There are seven applicants who have signed up to be considered tonight in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| And what we will do is that each applicant will be called on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| They will be called upon in the order in which they drew a little number up here a few minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| So everybody, I hope, remembers what their number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| But we'll call upon you in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| And the person who is called on will then come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| And they will have an opportunity for five minutes to speak to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=328)|
| 0:05:32| to give a presentation to council, to talk about their qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=332)|
| 0:05:36| and anything they feel that the council needs to hear with regard to the subject that's before them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| After that five-minute presentation is done, then there will be an opportunity for city council to ask questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| and to engage in dialogue with the applicant at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=351)|
| 0:05:55| And then when city council is done with the question and answer process from city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=355)|
| 0:06:01| there will be a ten-minute period within which folks who have signed up to speak on behalf of an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| will have an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And that ten-minute period will be divided among the number of speakers who have signed up to speak for each applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| I believe that we have already conducted the sign-ups, and so we have those up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| And so we will divide the ten-minute period between whoever has signed up to speak for each applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=383)|
| 0:06:31| Are there any questions from council members about the process that we will follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=391)|
| 0:06:36| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| If folks in New Orleans do want to sign up, what should they do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| If persons want to still sign up, then I guess they should probably come over and see Melissa right over here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=401)|
| 0:06:50| and she will assist you in signing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| We would like to get that done as quickly as we can so that people can devote their attention to the speakers as they arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| So if anybody else would like to sign up, please go ahead and do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Otherwise, we'll go ahead and get started if there are no other questions from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| The first person in order is Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| And everyone, if you would, when you first come to the podium, if you would just tell us your name and your address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| and then go forward from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=447)|
| 0:07:29| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| My name is Evelyn Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| I'm at 2504 Linden Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=452)|
| 0:07:43| I'm standing before you to say I would like to have my name withdrawn from full consideration of the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| Then we will move to the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Ann Dingus has signed up for the second position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| Ms. Dingus, if you would, please give us your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| And the time is 610.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| My name is Ann Dingus, and I live at 2117 Natchez, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| Honorable councilmen and councilwomen, you may not have noticed I have not asked anyone to come to speak for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| There's no one here going to speak on my behalf, and I chose not to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| There were several who wanted to be here tonight, but for the interest in time and fairness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| I had a little apprehension because in the 6th District, we all know some of the same people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=518)|
| 0:08:45| And I didn't want to alienate anybody for the future, especially my supporters, Walter P. Taylor Holmes, Austin Holmes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| Lonsdale, and McCannisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| These are my testimonies, people who have spoke for me and people who would speak for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| Therefore, I have come on my own interests and my qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| I hope that you will respect this choice, especially since the selection process is left up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| I would like to have this appointment of the caretaker position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| I trust your judgment, and I know that you will be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| The Honorable Vice Mayor Mark Brown has left an excellent job in helping and promoting this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| standing in the gap for us, strong leadership and his integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| This community must have a strong leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| I know that I will represent the city of Knoxville, friends, and families to the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| I'm dedicated, a long sufferer, and I have not quit because I believe in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=583)|
| 0:09:50| I love this community, and I love Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| I respect everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| I will serve this community with respect, honesty, integrity, courtesy, judgment, confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=595)|
| 0:10:04| perseverance, respect, patience, and reverence when I'm appointed to this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=604)|
| 0:10:10| My religious faith is Methodist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| I serve in my church as a leader, a missionary, usher board, community outreach, and a counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| But I have not yet had the nerve to join the choir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| I serve on my community boards in leadership and fellowship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| I will be honored to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I am willing to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| All I ask is that you give me the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| I pledged my interest in 1987 when I came in second to one of the most powerful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| and respectful councilmen, Ed Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=641)|
| 0:10:44| This community has already spoke for me to serve at city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| My vote ended in 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| I realize that this is only a 10-month appointment, and I will not promise to build sand castles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| in this shortness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| However, I am willing to bring the former mayor's works to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| What he has started must be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| I will roll up my sleeves and get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| All I need is your vote and confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| I have worked entirely for this community, and I will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| I have done this with pride and dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Admiration for my community, and I would like to stand as your profound leader in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=679)|

| 0:11:29| Realizing when I am selected to this position to have the powers to be as a team leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| to make the decisions that will impact all of us for the rest of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| Council, you know what it is to run a race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| You know the commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| Why should I want to be city council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Why do I feel like I'm qualified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| I passed the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| I ran the race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=713)|
| 0:11:55| I knocked on doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| I gave speeches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| I listened to all the concerns of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| I made telephone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| I'm not an opportunist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| I just didn't come when I heard about the opening for the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| I prepared for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| I gave my time, money, and I placed yard signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| I laid the groundwork for this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| This is not a transitional power for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| It's a burning desire for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| I have done sweat equity in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| This is who I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| This should not be about popularity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| It should be getting back to the basics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| It should be for the right people, the right time, and the right job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| It's imperative to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| I do not know everything about being a city councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| This is why I'm asking you for your vote and your confidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| because reality don't spur a fantasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Someone once said it was a livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| No, this is not my livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| This is a service to the people and for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| When you lose and you come back, it's not a fantasy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| It's dedication and commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| So I have been dedicated, and I have been committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| I have delivered my resume to you on my interests and my qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=794)|
| 0:13:15| I respect your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| And I'm honored and I'm humbled to have placed my name in nomination for the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| Thank you for your vote and your confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| I understand the decision has already been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=808)|
| 0:13:30| I know promises have already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=810)|
| 0:13:32| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| But I did not foresee just to sit here and not put my name in nomination when things are so critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| and making the budgets and people making good decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| I'm glad that I came forward, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=823)|
| 0:13:46| And I want to express my desires and commitment to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=826)|
| 0:13:49| Ms. Niggis, about 30 seconds, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Okay, just a moment, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| I'm not going to have a speaker, so just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| I hope that people in Austin Home and Lonsdale are listening, because those are the people that I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| My purpose as speaker was to be here tonight, but unfortunately, last night, death dangers came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| So she was not able to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=849)|
| 0:14:11| And I ask that you would just give the family the courtesy of just a silent prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| In the end, it is not about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| It's about you and your hearts, and that you truly are committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=859)|
| 0:14:23| Sometimes we don't understand when things happen, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| They did not mean for people to have status quo, and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| So let the people say and let the people make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| Thank you, Ms. Niggis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| Are there any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Quick question, Ms. Niggis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| First, if you are selected, do you intend to run for this seat in the fall of this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| I want to be the caretaker for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Also, I don't personally, I don't bet no other members of council take exception to you not having speakers here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=889)|
| 0:14:59| or you're not going to it's not going to count against you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| Someone having 15 minutes of speakers or 10 minutes of speakers, that's not going to be in favor of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| So I think you should rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| I think you should rest assured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you so very kindly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| The people who stand there are the ones that will get the most attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| I appreciate you totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| He asked my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| Any other questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| There are no speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| So we will proceed to the next applicant who is Bob Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=931)|
| 0:15:40| Mr. Booker, please give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| My name is Robert J. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| I live at 2621 Parkview Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=944)|
| 0:15:53| Honorable members of the Knoxville City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| I am honored to offer myself for consideration for appointment to the 6th District Councilman seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=957)|
| 0:16:06| I have lived in the district since it was reconfigured in 1969.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| Since I was 17 years old and a senior at Austin High School, I have been involved in community activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| I have taught school, worked as a community organizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| and for 16 years was Executive Director of a local nonprofit agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| For two years, I worked for the City of Knoxville in the Codes Enforcement Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| and with the Knoxville Housing Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| I have served on numerous boards through the years, including the United Way, Goodwill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=999)|
| 0:16:45| and the East Tennessee Historical Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| I also served on the Tennessee Committee for the Humanities and the State Civil Service Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| Currently, I am a volunteer at Knoxville College and serve as President of the Local Alumni Chapter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| Having been elected to three terms in the state legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| and having served seven years as Administrative Assistant to Mayor Kyle Testman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| I have some understanding of how city government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| I am also aware of the current economic downturn with the closing of local businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| and the loss of jobs by their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Surely those closings and layoffs will reduce city revenues and influence the coming budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1046)|
| 0:17:35| Though it may be a trying time, I believe City Council will make decisions in the best interest of the people of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1055)|
| 0:17:44| and I want to be a part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I have been committed to public service most of my adult life, and probably always will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1067)|
| 0:17:55| That is the spirit in which I offer myself this evening, and I thank you for allowing me to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1075)|
| 0:18:05| Thank you, Mr. Booker. Are there questions? Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Mr. Booker, same question. It will be the same question for all candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| Do you intend, if selected, to seek this seat in an election in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| No, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| None. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| We have one speaker signed up for Mr. Booker, Margaret Gator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| Ms. Gator, you have ten minutes as the only speaker signed up, and it is 621.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1112)|
| 0:18:39| If you would give us your name and address as a start, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you. My name is Margaret Gator, and I live at 212 Gator Circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1122)|
| 0:18:49| And to the members of Council, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1129)|
| 0:18:53| And I stand before you asking your support for Bob Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| And may I say to you that Booker did not ask me to speak for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| I chose to do it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| I believe I have known Booker throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| I've worked with him with the housing, I've worked with him at Beck Cultural Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| I've worked with him at Knoxville College, and also Austin High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| and just as a person in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| And as I think of the crucial time this is of our nation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1164)|
| 0:19:30| I believe that city council and local leaders will need those persons who are trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| and who have had experience to turn this and move our nation forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1178)|
| 0:19:45| I commend each of you for your untiring service that you give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| I don't think you make a lot of money serving on city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| so I commend you for your untiring work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| And I believe that Bob Booker is an independent thinker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| I believe that he would strengthen the work of the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| and I believe that each of us must start within our homes and as individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| Obama cannot serve and settle these problems by himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| I think it's going to take leaders working on a local level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and I believe that Bob Booker will strengthen your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| I believe he will be a voice for East Knoxville and the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1229)|
| 0:20:34| And I ask that you support him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| Thank you, Ms. Gator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1240)|

| 0:21:17| and I have been back living in Knoxville for the past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| I moved back here from Murfreesboro, Tennessee, where I lived for approximately seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| When I knew that I had to spend five minutes talking about myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| at first I became highly nervous because I'm not the one to brag on myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| and I'm actually a humble person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| but then I thought, Saranda, this is for you, so you got to do what you got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| Well, I'm 30 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| I'm unmarried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| I don't have any children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| I graduated from Carter High School in 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| I participated in different clubs like Mu Alpha Theta and National Honor Society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1312)|
| 0:21:57| I was offered several scholarships to attend college,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| but I ultimately chose a full academic scholarship to MTSU, Middle Tennessee State University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1321)|
| 0:22:08| where I initially double majored in math and art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1328)|
| 0:22:13| but I focused on art and I received my Bachelor of Fine Arts in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| I worked in my field for a while in Goodlessville, Tennessee for this multimedia company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1339)|
| 0:22:25| but then I started to really miss my home in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| So I moved back here with hopes of finding a job in my field and focusing on my career in art,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| but when I got back to Knoxville, my life took a different turn towards community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| See, I grew up in Austin Homes, which is a public housing community in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| and it has a rich history, both positive and negative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| and when I did move back, God immediately laid on my heart the need for a leader that will focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1370)|
| 0:22:58| on the youth, and in particular the at-risk youth and the youth that are at the poverty level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| And although I've always been involved with youth activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| the call for me to do more was urgently put on my heart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| because many things aren't being addressed concerning the inner city youth of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| I initially became active in the Austin Homes Resident Association, which is HUD funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| and it has over 200 resident membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| My grandmother was treasurer, and I began to build my leadership skills through that organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| and reaching out to other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Through my work in Austin Homes, I've accomplished many personal achievements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| and developed my leadership skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| I've participated in community petitions against harassing police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I helped start the Austin Homes Preservation Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| which attempted to preserve housing within my community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| and although we weren't successful, we were able to put the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| and concerns of the demolition on the table for the city to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| The actual demolition was put off for approximately a year and a half with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1439)|
| 0:24:06| Our association also participated in President Bush's faith-based initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| which was administered through Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| I was the main contact person for my association, and the program lasted almost two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| and it taught organizations how to fine-tune their programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| and ultimately receive grant monies to run them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1467)|
| 0:24:31| Lessons were taught in capacity building, locating funders and foundations, fundraising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| building relationships, and creating partnerships and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| Through that, we were able to recognize and develop relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| with different organizations and grassroots organizations within East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| and surrounding counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| We also wrote a grant proposal where we received $1,800 to fund our youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1494)|
| 0:25:01| at-risk youth program, Reality Check, which was initially started by Andrea Hughes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| who was then Executive Director of the Lighthouse Ministries at Austin Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| Bridgewater Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| And it was a group that mentored teens and pre-teens and discussed real-life issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1513)|
| 0:25:20| We had Bible studies, independent living skills, and dancing and sewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| and different things that would develop these youth into productive adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| Currently, I am still active in the Resident Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I was recently re-elected president last year, July 2008, and before that I was treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1532)|
| 0:25:39| We still have our youth programs that actually operate between July and October months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| where we do have a dance team that participates annually in the Austinese Homecoming Parade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| and different events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| Actually, our dance team is one of the first dance teams that participated in the parade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| Now you'll see a lot of dance teams, but Austin Homes started that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| When the position came open to fill out the rest of Mark Brown's term at city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| my first thought was, wow, that is for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1568)|
| 0:26:14| That would allow me to have a true positive influence over East Knoxville and Knoxville as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1574)|
| 0:26:20| I feel that I am highly qualified for the position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| and have put hundreds of community service hours in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| This is the truly...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| About 30 seconds, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| This is truly the focus of my life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| and my many talents are directed towards improving, uplifting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| and inspiring the many peoples on this earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| That's the will of God for my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| I accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| And this position will be the next step that's needed for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| to share my true ambition and dedication to community service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| I look forward to the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| and I honestly hope that it is me, Saronda Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| is who you will choose tonight to fill out the rest of Mark Brown's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Thank you, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Ms. Thompson, you mentioned in your letter to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| that you have participated in several leadership development programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| And I'm interested in hearing more about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| and how those experiences might affect your ability to serve the citizens of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| Well, actually, the things that I have participated in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| a lot of the programs were HUD funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| We do some training through KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| and the main big leadership program was through Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| It actually developed me to be able to deal with different organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| and different peoples and personalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| and how our personalities can work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| Because after our year was up and we received our monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| we actually carried on a leadership development class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| where participants from different organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| around the different counties actually were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| And actually Chris Woodhull actually spoke at several of our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| But those have developed me to be a leader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| and to be able to work with different personalities to progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| That's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1693)|
| 0:28:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1694)|
| 0:28:15| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| I'm going to ask Mr. Forrest a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| because it's, I think, a question a lot of us share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| If you're appointed to this, do you plan to run for the office in the fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| I wouldn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| I can't tell the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| If that's God's will for my life, we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| I just want to say we all remember you from the workshop three or four years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| involving Austin Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| and you did a fine job presenting yourself and your position then as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| Any other questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Seeing none, thank you very much, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Signed up to speak on behalf of Ms. Thompson is Tynesha Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| Ms. Davis, you are the only person signed up for Ms. Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| and so you have 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| 631.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| I am Tynesha Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| My address is 5983 Tenney Hill Drive, apartment 19B, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| Tonight I am honored to share with you why I believe Ms. Saranda Thompson is a choice candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| for the vacant 6th District Knoxville City Council seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| Saranda can be found among Knox County citizens who serve their community with consistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| and perseverance to promote growth and a more wholesome life for everyone around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Citizens of such caliber are too often overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| However, as we have seen, you all have noticed and recognized Saranda Thompson's talents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1786)|
| 0:29:53| You may be wondering what Saranda has done in this capacity tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1793)|
| 0:29:58| and we all have witnessed it and have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| For well over a decade, Saranda has been a pillar in the Austin Homes community of East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| because although she went to school and came back and was here for six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| she was still active in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| Saranda is a proactive organizer for the Austin Homes Rental Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| She stood for her community and submitted petitions concerning residential and housing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| Saranda stepped right in to fill a large gap left by a community legend, the matchless and late Dolores Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1828)|
| 0:30:36| known in the community as Mrs. Doohickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| Mrs. Doohickey directed the Austin Homes Recreation Center for just about her life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| I remember her even when I was younger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| I didn't live in the Austin Homes community, but my family and my relatives lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| And I remember I come to stay nights on the weekends with my aunt and my cousins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| We all go down to the recreation center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| We love Mrs. Doohickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| We love her so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| It's really hard to feel the shoes of a woman such as her, such as she.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| I just had to mention that because it made me cry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| It brought tears to my eyes just writing about her story, writing about her to support her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| She told me this last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| I didn't even realize that this was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| She just called me and told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| And I said, oh, my goodness, you don't have anyone to say anything for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| I have to write something, say something in your behalf because your story is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| What you do for the community is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| It's selfless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1899)|
| 0:31:41| She's truly dedicated to people, and she loves people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Saranda was there to comfort the children during the loss of Mrs. Doohickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| She alleviated their pain, and she developed a new beginning of mentorship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1910)|
| 0:31:58| while passing on the legacy left by Mrs. Doohickey, whom they still cherish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| Today, the children and adults alike in Saranda's community hold her with high regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| She has developed Reality Check, a self-initiated mentoring program for at-risk young girls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| And as she has stated, she picked that up from Andrea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| Reality Check is one among other programs Saranda has participated in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| or developed for the youth of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Daily, Saranda is sought out by her friends, relatives, and her community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1946)|
| 0:32:32| for direction, advice, and guidance second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| At heart, she is exceedingly compassionate, genuinely cares about others' well-being,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| and will stop at nothing to stand for what is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| In her personal life, she is grounded and highly focused, strong, and developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1966)|
| 0:32:52| I do not doubt for a split second the minute she fills the City Council seat, you will agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| and find Ms. Saranda Thompson alert and prepared to serve every citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| within Knoxville City's 6th District with sincerity, tenacity, and commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| From your fellow citizens, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you, Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| The next applicant is Dewey Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| Mr. Roberts, it is 636.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| I'm Dewey Roberts II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| I currently reside at 4701 Asheville Highway in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| And I'm a council person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| I just want to tell you that it is a great honor to sit up today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| and be considered for an appointment to the Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| In December of 2008, I retired after 35 years of service at Tennessee Technology Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| and I was looking forward to kind of a peaceful, quiet retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| A few days ago, my phone started ringing, and it just rang off the hook,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2029)|
| 0:33:54| and people were just urging me to seek this appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| So I thought, well, you know, you've been doing this all your life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| so you might as well continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| But one of the things that struck me, and one of the reasons I decided to go ahead and do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2044)|
| 0:34:08| was because so many of the people that called were concerned that their issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| and concerns of the community could not be met if we just had a caretaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| I don't know what the definition of a caretaker is, but I consider myself an activist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| And so my thought was, you know, if I can do this, I would only do it if I can do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| to improve the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| So my thought was, during this time period, I would, if appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2074)|
| 0:34:40| I would go and immediately conduct a listening tour of the 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| and find out what the concerns and issues are that plague our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| and bring them forth and put them on the table for city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Now, this will require some effort, especially in a 10-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| But I'm up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| I feel that it's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Right now, I sense a sense of excitement in the air in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| It could be because of the last recent election, but people are excited about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| and I want to keep that excitement going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2113)|
| 0:35:15| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2115)|
| 0:35:16| There's no way I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2116)|
| 0:35:16| And I felt that this would be the best way that I could keep the community involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| in what's going on with city council would be to end this position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| and really work toward keeping people actually involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Let me give you a little bit of my background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| My first public service was I was a representative on the Knox County Charter Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| a couple of years ago, a few years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| And, you know, it was a great experience because not only did I learn a lot about how city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| and county governments work, but I met some great, some of the brightest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| and most enthusiastic people that I have ever met here in the city of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| for serving in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| And I learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| I learned how city government functioned and county government functioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| and the details and intricacies of those different entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| So after I did that, my first experience really, public experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| was coming before city council back in 1992| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| and giving one of the first dozens of presentations urging the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| to adopt a police oversight board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| And I learned six years later the mayor really went ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| and did it by executive proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| But I learned a lot from that because I learned, what I learned from that experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| was that working together, what started as a very contentious situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| we used to come out and sit on one side of the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| and stare at Chief Keith and Mayor Ashton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We'd have this kind of confrontational, contentious situation going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| But after many years, we ended up working together and creating an agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2206)|
| 0:36:53| a city agency that not only served the city of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| but became a model for other cities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| So I learned from that experience that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| no matter how you start out, if you're persistent, you can make things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2223)|
| 0:37:08| And that's what I've tried to do in this community ever since I've been part of community leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| is to make things happen, to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| And also, I just, again, it's just a learning experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| it's just becoming involved in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| One of our major accomplishments during my tenure as president of Knox NAACP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| was our quest to equalize education opportunities in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| after the city and county school systems merged in the mid-'80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| And that effort resulted in over $50 million being spent on urban school development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| I'm very proud of that because, again, it's just hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| There's no substitute for hard work and getting in and doing what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| My most recent appointment was in 2003 when I was selected by Knox County Mayor Mike Rice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| to chair the joint Knox County Hate Crimes Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| And that was an organization, a task force that both mayors appointed people to represent the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| and county to look at finding ways to resolve the hate crime situation we had at that time in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| And we went around and we talked to a lot of people in the city and also in the county about how we can make things better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| And we did have a final report in the latter part of 2003 that had some recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| that I think both city and county governments took up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| In regard to this appointment, I want to say right now I have not personally lobbied any of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| nor have I asked anyone to lobby anyone on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| And I did that out of respect for the integrity of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2317)|
| 0:38:42| I want you to judge me with what I've done and what I've tried to do for this community and no other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| About 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| And knowing each of you guys, I know that you will make a decision based on conviction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| and what you feel that each of us can do for this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| And although I have no idea how any of you will vote, I am confident, just from knowing most of you personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| that you will select the person that you feel is best suited to lead the 6th District into the future that it deserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2348)|
| 0:39:17| And when the 6th District prospers, the city of Knoxville prospers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| And I thank you very much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| Mr. Roberts, you have three people who have signed up to speak on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I'm about to get out of order here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| I've got to have questions and answers first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| And Mr. Frostlight is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Same question, Mr. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| If you are appointed, do you intend to seek the election of this seat in the fall, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2381)|
| 0:39:46| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I'm going to use these ten months to do what I can to get the community involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| and set the stage for the next person, the elected representative, to hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2392)|
| 0:39:58| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| I suppose I have to ask this because you started your presentation saying that you actually were expecting a quiet retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| And I guess given what you've done and how people look at it, what made you think you'd have a peaceful retirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I know my mentor, Ms. Sarah McGreen, told me years ago, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| you never retire from public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| People always call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| Further questions from counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| Seeing none, thank you, Mr. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Now back to where I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| We have three speakers signed up for Mr. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| They are Charles Frazier, Belinda Kincaid, and Evelyn Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| You all have a total of ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| It's 643.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| You don't have to divide it up equally, but you need to average three minutes and 20 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| Mr. Frazier, you're listed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| You don't have to go first, but you're listed first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| I'm Charles Frazier, 244 MLK Jr. Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| It's indeed a pleasure to stand before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| I do thank God for that honor to be able to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| I want to tell you folks tonight that I have to speak for my friend Dewey Roberts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| and he's a friend and a colleague that I worked with for more than a decade with the NAACP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| as he was president and I was first vice president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| Dewey is a person of integrity, a person who is a hardworking person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2469)|
| 0:41:14| and one who is intermingled with all elements of our community, business, political, and churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| And tonight, Dewey has a little bit of support here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| If the people would stand up, the people that are supporting Dewey Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| So that's kind of important because one of the things that happens is sometimes we get far removed from people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| and what it's about in terms of politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And I learned that when I was in elementary school is government is supposed to be for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| I think Dewey has some real tough competition in getting this appointment tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| Bob Booker is a guy that I have a tremendous amount of respect for who served our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| and our city and is an awesome person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| I got to know a lot about him in the 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| And this young lady who spoke tonight, a graduate of Carter High School, Ms. Thompson, what a nice presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2517)|
| 0:42:03| Ms. Ann Degas, Stephen Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| And it's really just a pleasure to have people that are concerned about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| But I want to tell you all tonight, if you choose Dewey Roberts to represent this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| you're choosing someone, I think, if we were going to have a vote more than just six people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| that Dewey Roberts would win by way of vote from the people of the 6th District and City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| And the reason that he would win is he's been a winner in this community trying to make Knoxville better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| And Dewey Roberts needs one vote, one vote from each one of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| to acquire eight votes to be our next city councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Thank you, Mr. Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2562)|
| 0:42:44| Ms. Kincaid is the next to stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| It is an honor to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| My name is Belinda Kincaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| I reside at 1621 Lawson Avenue, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2574)|
| 0:43:02| Dewey Roberts II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| There is just one word that describes him to me, and that is integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| He is a man of integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| He is a man of great character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| When there are decisions to be made, he will not only think of the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2597)|
| 0:43:22| but he will think of the entire city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| And he will think of what is best for everyone that is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| Because he has spent his life, ever since I came to live in Knoxville from Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2609)|
| 0:43:37| he was one of the first people that I have ever recognized the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| And when I got to meet him in person, it was just such an honor to know the man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| that I have seen on television on many occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| to go and be able to comfort those who have lost their children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| to get up in the middle of the night and just fight for the rights of our people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2637)|
| 0:44:02| as he will do for all people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| But he has spent so many endless nights and days just giving of himself to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2645)|
| 0:44:13| giving of himself to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| Dewey Roberts is a man of great character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| He is a man with compassion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| He is a man with care and concern for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| And when you do vote for him, and you will vote for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| when you do vote for him, when you do vote for him as a 6th District Councilman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2677)|
| 0:44:44| your vote will be that greatly earned, and it will be that awesome vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2684)|
| 0:44:53| It will be that vote that is deserved because of all the time that he has spent in leadership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2693)|
| 0:45:04| giving of himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| And we thank you in advance for voting for Dewey Roberts II, 6th District Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| Thank you, Ms. Kincaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Evelyn Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| And I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| I've known Dewey one plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| I really don't want to tell my age because I've known him 14 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| And let me just say for the record, Dewey, since I've known him, has been a citizen ambassador,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| not only of the 6th District, but of the 5th District, the 4th District, the 2nd District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| and the 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| He's been an ambassador for the entire city of Knoxville for as long as I've known him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| What we fail to recognize is the fact that he has been an advocate for many community people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| and issues to improve this environment from the moment I've met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| He's a strong leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| And what he brings to the table is the capacity to help serve not only the people of the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2764)|
| 0:46:11| but to help improve the city of Knoxville, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| The next applicant is Cynthia Stansel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2780)|
| 0:46:27| Ms. Stansel, it is 649.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| I am Cynthia Stansel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| I live in the heart of the 6th District at 2003 Washington Avenue in the Park Ridge neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| Mark Brown has been a great leader as the representative for the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I know that he will continue his leadership in his new capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| We now need a leader, though, who can pick up where he left off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| and take the 6th District to its next level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| And I believe I'm that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| I've been very active in my district since I moved here with my husband a little more than three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2813)|
| 0:46:58| I applied for this position out of my desire to broaden my level of service to the entire 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| I know many who, like myself, have dreams yet to be fulfilled for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| Part of fulfilling those visions and dreams is a leader who is willing to do things differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| than we have done them in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| and who can help our neighborhoods knit themselves back together into a quilt of harmonious diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| I believe that that basic diversity is what makes our neighborhoods so rich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| and is the foundation on which we must build to sustain and enrich| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| and uplift the lives of all who live in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| Council has expressed a desire for a caretaker to fill out the remainder of Mark's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| Several fine people have stepped forward willing to serve in that capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Since the timeline for filling the seat was so compressed, I, too, applied for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| After talking with and seeking advice from those that I respect most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| I have decided to seek the position through election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| I would like for you all to know how much we appreciate your professional behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| and your thoughtful and contemplative decision-making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| You have shown Knoxville how to be a better public servant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you, Ms. Stansel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Are there questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2890)|
| 0:48:13| I think you answered their question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| Ms. Stansel, you have one person who has signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| and I just discovered why I will never be mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| Ann Santomasino-Ianides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| Close enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| It's Ann Santomasino-Ianides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| I live at 1620 Washington Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| 7917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| There are very few people who I would voluntarily speak in public for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| And so when I heard that Cynthia had chosen to apply for this caretaker position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| I really volunteered to do this because I felt that she is the best person qualified for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| And somebody needed to tell you some of the things that she's far too modest to say herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2940)|
| 0:49:07| I was trying to write down a few things that I wanted to say about Cynthia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| and my husband said, you know, go ahead and run over what you wanted to say to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| And I said, no, I'm not going to do that because she would never allow me to tell you all of the wonderful things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2955)|
| 0:49:20| that she's done for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| You see, Cynthia's commitment to this district is unparalleled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| Now, she hasn't been in this city for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| but most of you happen to know her and her husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| And I think when somebody makes a commitment to a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| when they really choose to make a home somewhere and buy in on every level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2979)|
| 0:49:46| on the community service and public service and neighborhood commitment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| she's done more probably in three years than I've heard so many people who are lifelong Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| They say to me, you know, my gosh, they do more with their time and Cynthia and John| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| and with their commitment to this community than people who've lived here their entire lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3005)|
| 0:50:11| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| They don't just live in the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| They actually embrace it, and they actually recruit people to embrace the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| You know, my husband and I were living out in West Knoxville when we relocated back from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| My husband's a native here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| And, you know, Cynthia and John were the reason that we chose to move to Park Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| because they are the district's greatest champions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| She's served on the board of our neighborhood organizations for multiple years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| And, you know, she's really committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| and contributed to solving the residential and commercial problems we face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3045)|
| 0:50:52| Well, some of the neighbors were saying that speeding traffic was a big problem in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3052)|
| 0:50:59| You know, and it's a threat to pedestrian safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| So she actually sought out the ways to get public funding for traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3062)|
| 0:51:10| and she is now bringing that to the neighborhood, and that will be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| And that doesn't affect her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3074)|
| 0:51:15| That's not in front of her house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| That's not her street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| She's doing this because she wants to make the district a better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3079)|
| 0:51:26| You know, there are other things that she does in the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3086)|
| 0:51:31| It's like working on a responsible business plan for the Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| You know, this is just, you know, one way that she is just looking for ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| to make this neighborhood a more viable place for new business to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| and hopefully new opportunities and new jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| Moreover, Cynthia is a visible, available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| and responsible person who will be there for her constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| She's always got the city's best interest at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| She's going to force you to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| So, you know, if you're not already on her speed dial, you better be prepared to be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| You know, because she's going to expect no less from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| than she's willing to give of herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Well, you know, the Cynthia Stancil that I really want you to know tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| that she's not going to tell you about is the more personal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| The woman who devotes her free time to mentoring disadvantaged local kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| through the college application process for financial aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| The woman who hosts fundraisers for nonprofit organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| who make commitments to our district, like Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| The person who tries to help troubled neighborhood kids find summer jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| that would teach them a trade for use in securing future employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| The person who spends weekends cleaning brush out of the botanical gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| The woman who delivers her very fantastic home-cooked meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| to elderly shut-ins of this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| The person who inspires you and inspires me to be a better neighbor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| to be a more responsible citizen, and a better caretaker of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3192)|
| 0:53:20| Well, you know, Cynthia's a person who makes a commitment to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| in my estimation, when nobody's watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| And I think that is truly what makes her an exceptional person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| That's the kind of person I want as a city council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| specifically my city council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| And that's the kind of person I think you should want, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| Thank you. Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| It's too late to ask a question. I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| Of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| With the consent of council, I think we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| I see no one shaking their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| Ms. Stancil, I just wanted to clarify that your intent was to withdraw from the selection process this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| because you do intend to run for the seat in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I do intend to run for the seat in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3255)|
| 0:54:16| You do not want to be considered this evening, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| That is your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| Okay. That's where I was not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| That is your decision, but I did want you to know that I do intend to seek that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| But you're not withdrawing from the selection process this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| That's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Okay. Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| I'm glad I clarified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| The final applicant, Stephen Mark Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3276)|
| 0:54:44| Mr. Dupree, it is 657.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Could you give your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| Stephen Mark Dupree, 112 South Gay Street, apartment B337902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3288)|
| 0:54:59| I want to introduce myself to you guys formally, but most of you know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| We've spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| I don't think I've spoken to Mr. Hall, but we could have accidentally run into each other at a Harley rally somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3303)|
| 0:55:10| I've been a rider for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| If you walk out to the middle of the Hill Avenue viaduct and look over the edge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3313)|
| 0:55:20| you'll have to use your imagination to visualize the dirt road neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3320)|
| 0:55:27| That was where I spent my first two years of life, so I'm told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| I don't really remember it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| And Mom and Dad bought a house over on Cruz Street off of Vine just down the street from the Phyllis Wheatley YWCA blocker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3332)|
| 0:55:40| so away from Mr. Roberts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| And that was where I reached the age of my majority, 18 at the time, went into the military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| When I came out, I moved into a Morningside neighborhood and registered to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| I voted at Eastport Elementary School, where indeed I went to elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Currently, I live downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| I have been all through the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| I've walked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| I've bicycled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| I've driven it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3371)|
| 0:56:13| I live 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| I've participated on any number of, well, I say any number, okay, maybe a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3378)|
| 0:56:25| boards and city people, Bijou Board with a guy you might recognize, Bill Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3385)|
| 0:56:33| I've recently joined the Race Relations Center Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| I was very active in Nine Counties, One Vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| I was the list owner for a number of years for K2K, which was an award-winning e-mail form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| award-winning model of citizen participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| I've been involved for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| I couldn't even begin to guess how many public meetings on how many different subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| I've been involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| And today, it's a little rough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| I'm having to compare, you know, that with his and Bob's and everybody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| And I'm thinking, you guys have a good group from which to choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3434)|
| 0:57:18| This is excellent company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3438)|
| 0:57:22| I can and will do the job if you so desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3442)|
| 0:57:26| The thing that I think sets me apart from some, if not all, of the candidates is I understand the huge diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3446)|
| 0:57:38| of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| It is Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| It is downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| It is East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| It is farther on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| There are affluent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| There are not so affluent neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3468)|
| 0:57:51| And the person who fills that seat, ideally, is going to be someone who recognizes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3471)|
| 0:57:59| and who seeks to engage all of those folks, all of those disparate views and disparate lifestyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3479)|
| 0:58:05| and everything else, who can speak to anyone, listen to anyone, and act accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3485)|
| 0:58:12| This I can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| I would also point out that the City Council has a certain balance, or at least had a certain balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3495)|
| 0:58:23| And I'm the closest of the candidates in weight to Mark Brown, so I keep that balance going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3503)|
| 0:58:35| I'd point out that I'm in robust health and able to make the meetings and all of that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| And I appreciate your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| I've enjoyed speaking with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| It is not my intention to suffer the serial torture known as running a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3527)|
| 0:58:57| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| I was just going to say the rest of my colleagues on Council might enjoy having someone on Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| with a sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Mr. Dupree, we have not had a resident of downtown represent the 6th District in recent memory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3551)|
| 0:59:18| and I wondered how you felt your residency downtown might affect your representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3558)|
| 0:59:24| of the citizens of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| We've seen a lot of change in downtown, and I'm just interested in your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| I think that as downtown grows, as a residential neighborhood in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| they deserve a level of representation, perhaps a step up from what we've currently seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| a level of consideration, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| It is too often overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3588)|
| 0:59:49| Typically, when we say 6th District, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| we usually mean the black neighborhood over there in the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3593)|
| 0:59:57| And that's not the totality of it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| That is certainly a major part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| But I am generally opposed to the casual disenfranchisement of any of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3602)|
| 1:00:08| I want everybody to feel like they have a voice on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| I also would point out that I do understand that all of you were elected citywide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| and, therefore, have a responsibility to all the citizens of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| I'm aware of that, and I'm willing to serve in that capacity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Well, you just, Mr. Dupree, you just brought to my mind an observation I'm going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3632)|
| 1:00:38| I don't know how aware everyone here is who is a resident of 6th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| that the 6th District extends very far west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| Actually, the western boundary, I won't put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3650)|
| 1:00:56| That would not be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| But it's so interesting because I share the boundary line with the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| and maybe to a lot of people's surprise, it actually is Hollywood Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3663)|
| 1:01:11| and it is west of West High School, which is a very diverse district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| And where I went to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3677)|
| 1:01:18| A very extraordinarily stretched out district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| So I think Mark Brown and I have very much shared some interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| and concerns about a part of his district which is a little bit more contiguous to some of my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3689)|
| 1:01:36| But it is, you've made, I mean, you all have made an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| It is a very large district, a very diverse district, and, therefore, I think extremely important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3699)|
| 1:01:45| and a very rich district, and especially in terms of our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3705)|
| 1:01:50| And that's what I've always been fascinated about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| But it just keeps moving farther west, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3713)|
| 1:02:00| Any further questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| Thank you, Mr. Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| That's, he has no speakers listed to speak on his behalf, so that's all of the applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| and all of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Let me, first of all, just say thank you all for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| This has been most interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| The thing I think that we have all learned is how blessed the 6th District is to have the type of leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| that has come forward tonight and offered yourself for public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Again, please accept our gratitude for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| At this point, Mr. Frost, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| Just a statement, General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| I was going to say we've got to, we're in a good situation and we're also in a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| The good situation is that we do have really well-qualified folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| The bad situation is, obviously, we can only pick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| In each round of voting, you can only vote for one person at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3777)|
| 1:03:04| I don't think anybody should take that as a slight whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| As I've looked over the resumes and listened to the folks, the candidates themselves speak tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| we have some people that are pretty well-versed in not just the 6th District, but the city as a whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3799)|
| 1:03:27| whether it's through their work in different organizations, getting away from here for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3807)|
| 1:03:35| seeing what works in other cities, and coming back here and wanting to implement the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| Like I said, this is a good situation, but it's also a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| So, hopefully, when folks leave here tonight, I mean, I do not think by any stretch of the imagination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3825)|
| 1:03:52| there's going to be a unanimous vote for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| I want to be clear about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| And one of the tough things you have to do is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| I might vote for the person who isn't going to be appointed, and likewise for other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| And whoever the ultimate appointee is, that does not mean that's a slight to anybody whatsoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| because like I said, we do have good choices tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3855)|
| 1:04:21| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| I just want to thank everyone for coming, and especially the candidates and the presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| And I think we've been very impressed by all of the candidates, and we'd be well-suited with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3868)|
| 1:04:36| I thought the presentations were excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| I appreciate the sincere interest and the enthusiasm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| and I could just feel it that your willingness to serve, and that's very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| And I would hope that all of you consider running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| And so I have large seats coming up in the very near future, and, of course, the 6th District in 10 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3895)|
| 1:05:04| And I know a number of you have your sights set on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3904)|
| 1:05:08| But I think, you know, it's a great experience to run for public office, even if you don't win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3908)|
| 1:05:16| And we're all, you know, better served when we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3916)|
| 1:05:21| I will not support anyone tonight that plans to run in the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3921)|
| 1:05:26| because I think that would give them an advantage being an incumbent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| And I hope to see a very good race with good debate and discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3930)|
| 1:05:35| because I think in the end when you interact with the constituency, the taxpayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3935)|
| 1:05:40| you end up being a better council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| But I'd just like to say I'm sorry I can only vote for one candidate at a time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3944)|
| 1:05:50| because I think several of you would do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| And you've got some tough shoes to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| Vice Mayor Brown not only did a great job for the 6th District, but really for the city as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| And he served the city very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| So I think you have a great role model in Mark Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| And I'd just like to say I hope you don't hold it against me if I don't vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| That doesn't mean I don't think you'd be a great city council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| But thank you all very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| I could say ditto, and that might be enough, but it's hard when you're up in this position just to say one word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3988)|
| 1:06:34| So I won't stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| But I agree, it's an incredible group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| I was just sitting here thinking, if we have this kind of a slate of candidates that file petitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4000)|
| 1:06:49| these people are other people of equal quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| It's such an impressive group that filed petitions to run for the 6th District seat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| or any of the council seats as far as other people of similar character and ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| We'll be doing very well in the upcoming elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| I just hope we do have that many good, good candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4025)|
| 1:07:10| I know some of you may run, some of you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| That's a comment in terms of what I believe we have in terms of quality of choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| And as everybody said, it's going to be tough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| and I don't think any of us want anyone to take our vote as a slight to anyone that we don't vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| I'll just say that I'm leaning towards someone also that will be more of a caretaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| that's not clearly running for the seat, although in a way I hate to even limit it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| But I'm really reluctant to sort of try to position anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| and I think I probably will try to focus the vice mayoral vote, my vote for vice mayor the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| I just want to say ditto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| Mr. Woodhull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I also want to congratulate all the people for putting their hat into the ring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| and being willing to come forward and go through the very nerve-wracking process of speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4092)|
| 1:08:20| and having people ask you questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4100)|
| 1:08:25| And this is an extremely impressive group of people for lots of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| It would be great to have one person that consolidated all of these different talents into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| I do want to just comment on this idea of the word caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| I don't necessarily resonate with the word caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| If you take that word to mean being on cruise control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4123)|
| 1:08:48| because it's not possible to be in the 6th District and to be on cruise control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| That's a very demanding district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| All the districts are demanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| but there are particular challenges in being a district council member in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| And so we are actually placing someone in a very difficult position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| difficult in the sense of its history and its current challenges and its future potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4149)|
| 1:09:17| So caretaker in the sense of taking care of the people, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4157)|
| 1:09:23| but not in the sense of just on cruise control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| And the people have experienced, as we have on council, a very abrupt shift in leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4167)|
| 1:09:33| And so the people are going to be we need somebody who's going to be real available and engaged for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4173)|
| 1:09:41| So as we think about this decision, I take one of those comments to be out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| Well, I agree with all the comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| And I want to thank you all for taking the time to come out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| I think all the candidates we've heard from tonight would make an excellent council person in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4199)|
| 1:10:06| And so good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| Well, I'll certainly echo all of the words that have been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| It's really been an extraordinary opportunity to hear each of you speak about yourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| and about your accomplishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| Extraordinary group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| I think particularly in the sense of I know how much courage it takes to talk about yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4228)|
| 1:10:34| and to sell yourself, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| So I just think how rich this community as a whole is to have had the kind of selfless individuals that each of you embody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4240)|
| 1:10:53| Knoxville would not be the wonderful city to live in that it is if it were not for each of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4253)|
| 1:11:01| and for all the contributions you've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| I've worked with a lot of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| Many of you have been before us in the past few years and have admired you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| I feel I know almost everyone well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| and know that you all have made enormous contributions to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| And then I want to thank you for making yourself available and vulnerable to this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4285)|
| 1:11:31| because it's such an important process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| And I think I want to echo what Councilman Woodhull said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4294)|
| 1:11:38| in the sense of the caretaker little phrase that we've used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| because I guess I thought of it as caretaking for the district for this short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4303)|
| 1:11:53| On the other hand, it is a very engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| There's just no being up here and not feeling very engaged, very involved, and very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4318)|
| 1:12:08| I think I see one of the largest challenges before anyone who steps into this short-term situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4328)|
| 1:12:17| as being, gee, we've all been here, we've had the opportunity to have a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4337)|
| 1:12:23| had a lot of past discussions that we have heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| And it's going to be a tough position to walk into this kind of new, in a sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| although I know you've all been so engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| So thank you so much for putting yourselves in a position where you will have to catch up quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4360)|
| 1:12:46| and really jump on your feet and get running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4366)|
| 1:12:50| But thank you so much, and thank you particularly for what each of you all mean to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| And I truly hope that we'll see a lot more of all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4377)|
| 1:13:02| I know the decision on our part is to make one person be able to serve in this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4382)|
| 1:13:15| But I see you all as just so valuable, so valuable to this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4395)|
| 1:13:21| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| I agree with Councilman Pilo that I don't think any member of this council is ever on cruise control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4405)|
| 1:13:31| So, you know, I think every one of us is engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4411)|
| 1:13:34| and it may be a unique challenge in the 6th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| but I think it's a unique challenge for every member of this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| And I think we all do take our work very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| I wanted to push back a little bit on one of the candidates' statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| that it was their understanding that this council preferred a caretaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| If that is the sense that the community has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| I would blame that on anyone who might have reported on this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| because I think this council has taken very, very seriously the obligation not to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| with one another who the candidates are or who we might prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4444)|
| 1:14:09| or who we might hope run or any part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| So, you know, certainly members of the media can talk to us one-on-one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| and a consensus might be gained in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| But, you know, I would hate for any member of the public or the candidates to feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| that there was somehow already an agreement on this council that a caretaker was preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| I certainly can see advantages to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| You know, someone who is interested in running in the fall gets a head start on representing the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| in the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| On the other hand, there's the, you know, the perception of incumbency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| So I guess I'm undecided on that and can see advantages for the citizens both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4488)|
| 1:14:55| And certainly our calling is to pick the most qualified candidate that we feel can best represent the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4495)|
| 1:15:01| of the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| Seeing no other lights, let me recap the process that you all have agreed on for the voting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4505)|
| 1:15:13| With the exception of Ms. Gill, who has withdrawn, there are six now applicants who have put their names in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4513)|
| 1:15:22| So all of those folks have been placed in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| So what's going to happen next is the city recorder will call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| And when your name is called, if you would state the name of the person you wish to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| When that process is completed, if we have less, it takes six votes to select a new council member for the 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4537)|
| 1:15:48| So if we go through this process and no single applicant has six votes at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| we will delete from the next round of voting the person or persons who have the lowest number of votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| and then we will vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| And we will continue that process until some person has six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| Any questions about the process we will use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Everybody understand that when your name is called, you announce the last name, please,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4570)|
| 1:16:17| of the person you wish to vote for for that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4583)|

| 1:16:34| Dingus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| Dupree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4604)|
| 1:16:48| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| Mr. Booker has five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Mr. Dupree has two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Ms. Dingus has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| And there were no votes for Stansel, Roberts, and Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4625)|
| 1:17:13| So those three will be eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| No, because zero is less than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| So we will now go again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4645)|
| 1:17:31| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090212specialcalled?start=4651)|
