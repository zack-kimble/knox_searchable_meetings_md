| 0:01:23| For those of you who received an agenda and for all the folks who may be watching at home, the next item on our agenda is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=83)|

| 0:01:41| But I want to find out if there's any members of the public who are here today that would like to address County Commission because I haven't gotten any advanced notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=101)|
| 0:01:52| Is there anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Okay. Prior to this meeting, Kim Frazier reached out to me to address County Commission at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| If it pleases this body, I know that she wanted to speak to us regarding the planning discussion that we have around that resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=122)|
| 0:02:11| I spoke to Kim and I think it would probably be best served if we allowed her to speak to that subject when we get to that item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=131)|
| 0:02:19| If that is okay with my fellow commissioners, seeing general nods, then that will be, Kim, we will move you to the agenda when we come to that particular discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=139)|
| 0:02:33| Moving on to the amendments or changes to set our agenda, there were two items that we discussed in the finance meeting that were both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=153)|
| 0:02:45| we decided we would table them and bring them up at the end of tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=165)|
| 0:02:50| One was to add a discussion item regarding the VSP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| We're going to add that to be discussed at next week's full commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| I think we'll have the full details on that so we will need to, we can add that tonight to be added to the agenda at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=181)|
| 0:03:09| The other item that we'll discuss tonight, and I want to thank Commissioner Schoonmaker for running a really informative finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=189)|
| 0:03:16| One niche that John has done really well in his finance meetings is sharing with us the state of Tennessee revenue information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=196)|
| 0:03:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker, we will add at the end of tonight's discussion an opportunity for you to share with the commission and our public the information around state of Tennessee revenue collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=204)|
| 0:03:35| So that is another item that we will formally add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=215)|
| 0:03:40| Other than that, the items that we have to put on the consent agenda, I will review those and we did have a couple of folks weigh in during the, at the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=220)|

| 0:04:14| 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=254)|

| 0:04:48| One request that Commissioner Jay had was the discussion item that he brought up is item 42 was pertaining to item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=288)|
| 0:04:58| So if it pleases this body, we will discuss item 42 prior to item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| Are there, another item we will need to set up later at the end of our agenda tonight is we need to set up a date for a public hearing for zoning ordinance 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=306)|

| 0:12:13| This is at the corner of Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Is there any plans for the school to address those two problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| while we're maybe looking at this one also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Well, this particular item is part of the larger streetscape project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=742)|
| 0:12:29| that the city has planned in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| And they plan to do some significant work around South Knoxville Elementary School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=752)|
| 0:12:37| and on Barber Street as well, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| The specifics of speed humps, I'm not sure about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| I think those may exist, but I can run that down and get back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| If you would, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Is there any other discussion on this particular matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| The motion for approval is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| I should have said this at the beginning of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| but we had a great finance meeting that was led by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| and a lot of folks in the audience were not here for that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Hearing Commissioner Daley weigh in on this reminded me that if there's one person in this room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| that deserves recognition, it's Commissioner Daley just for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| Let's take a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| He's a friend to all of us, and, boy, you've had a really painful go this last several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| I mean, it's months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| And I know it was hard work just to get here, and we are so grateful to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Your journey is not over, but you've got a lot of friends and colleagues on this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| who are praying for you and pulling for you and will do anything we can to help you get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| So good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| I know it hurts like the devil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| But you do have a little more coloring in your face than you did the last time you were up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| So that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| It makes me feel better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| I also wanted to thank John Lott, who is sitting out in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=846)|
| 0:14:12| who gave several of us commissioners a tour through our Knox County Forensic Center, the new Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| So I wanted to thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Okay, Madam Clerk, moving on with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| Okay, Item 10, Resolution 202 is approving a contract with Humatech of Nassau, Tennessee, Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| for humidity control panels for coolers and freezers in school cafeterias| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| as needed up to $40,000 annually for the term of January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=877)|
| 0:14:45| with the option to extend for four additional years, one year at a time, for a possible total of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| The Chair will entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| And there's a motion for approval by Commissioner Daley and a second by Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| The Chair will entertain discussion and call on Commissioner Daley for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| Mr. Oaks, in my previous job I had the opportunity to, I know the owner of Humatech, so I'll recuse myself from a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=908)|
| 0:15:18| But I think this is a very, very cost savings for the schools and the nutrition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| Would you just briefly tell everyone what this does, how it saves money for the school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=924)|
| 0:15:32| I don't have the details on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| What I can tell you, though, is that we do have humidity controls in all of our coolers and freezers right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| and this contract is really for repair parts and replacement for those that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=942)|
| 0:15:48| Yeah, it's almost like a refresher where vegetables might be a week, it'll extend it another week or so by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=948)|
| 0:15:57| It keeps the appropriate humidity for either fruits, vegetables, or frozen foods in all of our coolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| I just wanted to say that I've seen this on hand and I think it's a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Point of order, Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| If you recuse yourself, you can't make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| I don't think you have a gain other than knowing the guy, so I don't know if there's any reason not to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=977)|
| 0:16:24| Okay, is there any other discussion on this particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| Okay, this motion is, Commissioner Daley, if you are going to weigh in on this one, then this motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| So, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| The next item is number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| It's Resolution 207, authorizing the acceptance of the 2019 Read to Be Ready Summer Program Grants from the Tennessee Department of Education for Green Magnet Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1010)|
| 0:17:00| Lonsdale Elementary School, Saramore Green Magnet Academy, and South Knoxville Elementary School in the total amount of $168,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1020)|
| 0:17:11| All right, thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| I was the one who actually pulled this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| It looked interesting, and in particular what we can do to help kids with summer reading for our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| So, the Chair, I pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1042)|
| 0:17:25| I'd like to have another Commissioner make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Okay, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders, and the first second came from Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| So, I believe I see John Ryswick, who they do sell razors over in Walgreens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1055)|
| 0:17:43| So, just I almost didn't recognize you, but if you'd like to add some insight to this, it looks pretty interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1063)|
| 0:17:50| and I'm sure it's something we probably do on a routine basis, but any time where by addressing this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| it also gives you all a chance to tell us what you're doing to help our kids how to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| So, by calling you on this, I thought it was a good opportunity to talk about some of the good things you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| So, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Thank you, Mr. Nystrom, and I missed No Shave November, so I figured I'd just take care of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1086)|
| 0:18:13| No, we are excited about this grant in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| This does target four of our elementary schools, Green, Lonsdale, Saramore Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| and this year we're happy to add South Knox to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| And these are dollars that come from the state to provide some literacy training for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1106)|
| 0:18:34| So, we typically hire our own staff for that who have already been highly trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| but it really prevents the summer reading loss that can happen for students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| So, it gives them, it doesn't extend their school year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| but it's a program where they can go to their school and receive that instruction in grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| and it targets first grade through third grade students to try to close that gap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| which is a big focus of our school system as well, that third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| You've probably heard Mr. Thomas speak to that, but our third grade literacy rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| although we're 28th out of 144 districts in the state, and by far of the large metropolitans further ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1141)|
| 0:19:10| I think Metro Nashville and Shelby are south of 100, we're proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| We still only have about 40% of our third graders reading on grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| with a goal to get to 75% by the year 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| And so, we have about 228 third grade classrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1163)|
| 0:19:27| and that would mean we would need one additional student per year over the next seven years to reach that 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1167)|
| 0:19:33| If we were to reach that, we would by far be a nation leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| and we have our sights set on that, so I'll leave the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| So, we think this builds off of some of the things that we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| We train our teachers in a year-long reading course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| because some of their teacher prep programs don't spend a lot of time on literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| It really is brain surgery, how you do that, rocket science, how you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1191)|
| 0:19:58| because it is a difficult concept to teach the foundational skills of reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| and to teach a student who doesn't know anything around that and teach them how to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1203)|
| 0:20:09| and especially in our high poverty areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| So, we are doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| It will build off some of the work that we're already doing for our professional development in the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| and training our teachers, and so we're excited to expand that through the summers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Commissioner Gill, I see your light on pertaining to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, because is it the summer reading program, the entire summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1225)|
| 0:20:32| is it three days, five days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Will we track the students as they complete the school year, then how they do during the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1234)|
| 0:20:42| and what will be the benchmarks that we begin to measure as school reopens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| Does that involve transportation and food for kids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| Because it is a summer essential bridge component that really will just measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| how well those kids retain some of the reading skills that they need to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| It is a four- to five-week summer program, and there are, in those schools already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| there are a lot of the meals programs and supports that exist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1271)|
| 0:21:15| It's actually an initiative of the state, and that's required for funding for the grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| that we do track that data and turn it into the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| It was one that they actually had reports statewide, as we participated last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| that actually they made significant increases and gains in those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| So we would expect to see a very similar outcome this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| I just got one follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| So the Ready to Read program is the program to train our teachers that's coming the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1297)|
| 0:21:42| or second week in February, it's the same program for the training component that will take place here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| So we do our own training in-house to identify those teachers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Yes, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| It's kind of a combination of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| So we do a lot of training specific for early literacy for our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| and the state also offers training that's required for this grant for our teachers to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1322)|
| 0:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Thank you, Mr. Wysak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| This item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| All in favor of it, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1340)|
| 0:22:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Item number 22, Resolution 501,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| is approving a grant contract with the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency for Homeland Security Grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1354)|
| 0:22:40| in an amount not to exceed $352,071 for first responder equipment and training for the 16 counties comprised in Tennessee Homeland Security District 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1360)|
| 0:22:51| including Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1371)|
| 0:22:52| No local match required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Good to see you, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| I was actually the one who pulled this specifically because I think any investment that we make in safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| in particular from Homeland Security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| is probably something that the public would want to know that we're investing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| But first, the Chair will entertain a motion for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| There's a motion from Commissioner Anders and a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| So, Dwight, if you'd like to add some insight to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Dwight Vanderveet for Knox County Community Development, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| This is a program that has been in place for 13 years, and we're very proud of the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| Although, over those 13 years, post-9-11, obviously, the dollars have diminished significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1415)|
| 0:23:41| We are the urban county for Homeland Security District 2, which is the largest Homeland Security District in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1421)|
| 0:23:48| Actually, our current chair is Mayor Terry Frank from Anderson County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| In the past, our committee has been chaired by Mayor David Perkey from Hamblin County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| who went on to be the Commissioner of Safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Homeland Security funds come in from the state to the districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| and the state requests that the districts decide what their needs and priorities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| and make funding decisions accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1447)|
| 0:24:09| Rather than the state doing it from the top down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| they give us federal priorities and ask the districts to do it from the district area up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| Our district has a long history of having a robust training program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| the most robust training program in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| We're very proud of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| You'll see it's the largest funding item, and this goes back to a conversation many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1466)|
| 0:24:32| When these funds first came in, it was led by Chief Robert Presley from the Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| who has since passed away, who made the point that training was our single biggest need in this area throughout these 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| These counties actually vote to take the lion's share, probably about 40% of the money that comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| and devote it solely to training in these 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| It continues to bring us value to this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| Active shooter training, we have trained in counterterrorism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| We have trained in dynamic rescue-type trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| We've trained across all disciplines, fire, police, EMS, and it has been very successful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| So I don't know if there's any questions about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| but a program of longstanding that has brought a lot of value and continues to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1513)|
| 0:25:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1518)|
| 0:25:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Are there any other questions from any of our fellow commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| This item is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1525)|

| 0:25:34| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Item number 26, Resolution 702, is approving a contract with Gresham, Smith, and Partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| in the amount of $300,000, largely funded by a grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| for a Greenway Corridor Study for Knox County to identify priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| and long-range improvements for four major corridors, including North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Beaver Creek, Chapman Highway, and a portion of John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1558)|

| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| Seeing no discussion on this item, all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1577)|

| 0:26:24| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Item number 28, Resolution 802, approving and authorizing the acceptance of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| from various sources in the fiscal year 2019 Knox County budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| for the furtherance in certain programs as described on the attached list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| There's a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1605)|

| 0:26:47| And a second from Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Is there any discussion on this particular item from the finance department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| I'll go ahead and call on, yeah, I pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Anytime we've got financial transactions going through here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| I do think it's proper not to just give them a quick pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| but I'll go ahead and call on Mr. Caldwell to give us a little more detail on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1627)|
| 0:27:14| You're not just updating us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| You are updating the public through this form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| We started this process a year ago as we closed out FY18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| and what we're doing is we're just asking the commission to approve these estimations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| and appropriations as it relates to the items on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| and you will see things on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| A lot of them in the general fund are related to the sheriff's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| from sexual offender registration, inmate money, interchange money, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| So it's just taking that money that came in, estimating and appropriating it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| and you'll also have some in a public library that, I think there's one that's the Rothrock Estates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| which we get once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| And so our plan is to bring this at least twice a year for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| and not just wait until the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| but it's things that we anticipated, and you'll see some things on there for schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| And so it helps to get that approval so it's formally as an amended budget item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1694)|
| 0:28:23| in these funds that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| Is there any other questions for Mr. Caldwell, Commissioner Skinmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1711)|

| 0:28:37| what is the designations for $163,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1717)|
| 0:28:45| That would have came when we brought those the last time at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| I could get you a list of what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| I don't recall what made up that list of designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| That got approved with the other designations last August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| But I can get you a listing of what those were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1742)|

| 0:29:30| the mediator fee in the amount of $3,150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| court costs and Knox County Outside Counsel Arnett, Draper, and Haygood, LLP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| in the amount of $48,895.20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| all related to the lawsuit style Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1782)|

| 0:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Do I have a motion for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| He can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| Well, I know that we've got a blank right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| I guess before we have a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| what I'd like to do is ask Mr. Caldwell to come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| if this is okay with my fellow commissioners, this does need to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| You're pointing to Commissioner Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| I was just going to make the motion, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1817)|
| 0:30:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1819)|
| 0:30:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| So we have a motion for no recommendation from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1822)|
| 0:30:24| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| And a second from Commissioner Gill to move forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| But moving on to discussion on this, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| I know you placed this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| If you could give us a little more insight on this particular question that you need us to help you answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| So there is, I think, a total of two items on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| one being the fees that is related to the lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1847)|
| 0:30:56| and then there's a second item where it is a reimbursement of employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| and I can speak to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| And so I think the last time this was brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| the commission voted for us to be represented by Arnett, Draper, and Haygood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1864)|
| 0:31:15| so we contacted them through the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| gave them all the files that they had to have to go through what they deemed was the appropriate steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| to figure out what would be a reasonable amount to reimburse said attorneys from the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1885)|
| 0:31:37| And in doing that process, they did recommend that we seek mediation through former Chancellor Darrell Fansler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1897)|
| 0:31:47| which we did, and that's the $3,150 amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1907)|
| 0:31:55| And so we have not got the amount for court costs yet, so we are awaiting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| So I will say that that's not part of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| And so what you have are three different costs in Resolution 803,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| one being the agreed-upon amount of the class attorneys, which is the $97,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| which you probably have a breakdown of the three amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| Holyfield was the most expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| He was like around $78,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| Herb was, I think, like $17,000, and the other amount was like $3,000, I think, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| And then you have the amount for the mediation, which went to Mr. Fansler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| and then you have the fees paid to Arnett, Draper, and Haygood, which was J. Mabe and Robert Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1962)|
| 0:32:52| And so that's what this resolution is, and I can speak a little bit to Resolution 804 in this sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1972)|
| 0:33:00| As we were going through mediation, what kept on getting hung up were the amounts that employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1980)|
| 0:33:09| and former employees had already paid to said class attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1989)|
| 0:33:14| and they talked about, you know, you've got to calculate this with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1994)|
| 0:33:18| And so finally, Rob Frost said, the best thing we can do is let's reimburse those employees separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| and just get to the heart of the matter, which is their fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| And so that's why that is separate in 804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| And so that would be the total of the entire case, excluding court costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| which I don't know how quickly the court would give that to us, but once we do, we can bring that in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2019)|
| 0:33:47| What I wanted to do was this, was bring this before you for informational purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| and also get direction on how to proceed with where to charge this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2034)|
| 0:34:00| We have basically temporarily put it in our non-departmental account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2040)|
| 0:34:12| and so that can be transferred, which is what we're looking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I just want direction from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| I know the last time we had this discussion, there was a lot of back and forth on where this should come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| And so I think we held off on a lot of transfers, so that's fine, and we'll bring that back next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2065)|
| 0:34:33| But I'm just looking for direction, and wherever this commission directs it to be paid from, that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2073)|
| 0:34:40| And if it's an estimation and appropriation from fund balance, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2080)|
| 0:34:46| I'm just looking for guidance on where that payment should come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| All right, thank you. The motion's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| You've provided insight, and I do have a light from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| Yeah, and I may be missing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| I'm looking for a detailed bill from Draper and Hager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| They're getting $48,000 for, in essence, a couple of weeks of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2104)|
| 0:35:10| and Mr. Holyfield worked almost a year on his lawsuit and is getting $77,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| I can get you those details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| I'd like to see the breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| And so they actually ended up doing, there were three attorneys that worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2119)|
| 0:35:25| They tried to get the, I don't want to call it grunt work, but some of the churning of the work to the lower paid guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| And so I'll send you all the detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| There was two or three invoices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| Let me send those to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| I think they do them like they normally do by month, and so I'll send those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2142)|
| 0:35:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| And is there a PREV for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I think we have an outside counsel fund, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| Is that what we have in the law department now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| or is that what we were holding up on the balance transfer or the line item transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| There is an outside legal fee account, and so currently that account resides in Fund 266,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2158)|
| 0:36:06| and we talked about transferring that to 101 because Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2166)|
| 0:36:11| found where the commission is supposed to approve the outside legal fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2171)|
| 0:36:18| and worked with the law director and said we would transfer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| I think that transfer got brought back about the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| and so we chose to hold off to wait to see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| And so you have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| If you wanted to charge, if you wanted to direct me to charge that there, you have two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| You could say charge it there and we charge it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2197)|
| 0:36:40| You could estimate and appropriate so we could increase that account by a set amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| and that way it's not really affecting anything that is currently going on in that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| So you do have some options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| But either way, whether it's in 266 or 101, we're going to transfer it to 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| That has to be done for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| I guess weighing in, calling on my own light, Chris, something that you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| if we transfer that to the outside legal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I know we've got some other legal things that the law department is managing right now for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| I don't want to put the law department in a position where they're hamstringed about doing their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| So did you just say that if it went to that account that we could appropriate money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| from the general fund to, for lack of a better word, put it in that account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| because that might be the right way to track it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| but then do we increase the budget for that particular line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| so that if we need to spend money on outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| say related to the lawsuit that was filed about the jails or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| I guess I don't want to have Bud's office hamstrung about doing anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| if that's what this body wants, however we want to track the accounting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| That's so correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2276)|
| 0:37:57| So I think it's as simple as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| You all could direct me to charge it to wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| But then you can also come back and say we're going to charge it to account X,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| but we prefer to estimate and appropriate to pay for that expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| That way it doesn't have an impact on what their balance is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| So as an example, in the outside legal fees, I think the normal budget is $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2300)|
| 0:38:27| $525,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| So what we would do is just call this amount $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| I don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| And we could just estimate and appropriate, which would increase that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| That way there's not an impact to that account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| So the available balance left to the law director's office is not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| The question is then a direction of where to estimate from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Is it from fund balance or is it from a revenue source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| That maybe you think would be over collected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| First I'd like to say that over the last,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| since Bud's administration has been in charge of the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| they have never came close to using their total outside legal fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| and that's a testament to the fact of how he's ran his office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| and the quality of lawyers that he has there to handle different cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| that we don't have to use outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| In looking into this, if you look into our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| it says that within the law director's budget we, as commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| are supposed to set the amount of money that is available to him to hire outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| And what has been happening that's been hanging out in an internal fund, the 266 fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| what that is a check in a way of we set that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| and if the law department needs to hire outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| they have to come back to commission to ask for the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| Now, Bud, I don't know where you're at in your budget right now on outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| but I imagine if you followed any of your past years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| you're probably nowhere near reaching that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| Well, there's a misnomer about the account being outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2409)|
| 0:40:16| The account where we do hire outside counsel also includes court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| It includes expert witnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| It includes court reporters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| It includes a lot of litigation costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| Where we have tried to manage that is in the world of outside counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| Up until this one particular case, and I felt the same way about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2437)|
| 0:40:42| what happens, and I'm not going to use any particular department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| but we might have a lawsuit that includes three or four different employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| And evaluating that lawsuit, we see that employee A and employee B are really righteous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| but employee C could end up not getting a good defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| because A and B may need to go against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| So if we're representing the county and we end up representing A and B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| then I am forced to hire outside counsel for C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| so that their constitutional rights will be upheld,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| that they will have good representation and the county is not in a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| The same is true as if it's an internal thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| I mean, we hire outside counsel or outside counsel is hired for these salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| Even if it's an internal department that doesn't have outside counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| in the sense like it used to, the sheriff's department would do us a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| We're using letters of agreement now, but even at that, that would be where that would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| We don't just generally hire outside counsel to relieve a workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| We're getting pretty close right now, but I will advise commission to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2518)|
| 0:42:04| We have one particular case that is extremely taxing coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| Well, we have two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| One, that we have a venue in Chattanooga with over 30 witnesses that may have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2530)|
| 0:42:16| may have to eat some of that, which is extraordinary from your experiences with me in the past six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2536)|
| 0:42:23| We also have one in Nashville where we have 40-something witnesses and two experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| that will hit this account and it will hit this account this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| I have no idea what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| So the other side of that thing is it says that the commission shall fund the necessary expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2557)|
| 0:42:43| to litigate and cover for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| So to a degree there is a discretionary in the way it's been done in the past for this entire account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| I think it's been budgeted for $650,000 to cover everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| but within that line item we can move money around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| I try my best to stay away from outside counsel because, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| we have probably one of the best, if not the best, law firms in state Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| I believe that, especially for a governmental type law firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| And we've got a tremendous success rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| I have had to hire outside counsel before for some of our school's issues just because of the overload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2602)|
| 0:43:33| At one time I had one very experienced school attorney and one gaining experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| And so we were hit with more than one attorney could really handle effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| and so we've had to hire outside counsel for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| And it's not been in a conflict situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| Today, over the years that I've been here, we've been able to mitigate that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Now we have three different attorneys with educational specialization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| and one with a special ed specialization where together we have the resources to hopefully offset some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2643)|
| 0:44:10| But I may be sending three attorneys to Nashville, and this could be a two-week trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2650)|
| 0:44:16| It's not cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| So what is that dollar figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I don't know, but that's why we manage that account the way we manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| And it's really not paying outside attorney fees in the sense most of our expenses come from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2663)|
| 0:44:31| I just wanted you all to know what the account really does, and it's not just to hire counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| All right, but either way with these two lawsuits coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| it sounds like at some point you may be having to come back for commission too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2680)|
| 0:44:45| Well, it depends what happens tonight as to whether I may or may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| I believe without a doubt I think I can manage these cases with what I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| but with the uncertainty because you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| You know, you get in a case, it's two weeks, well, it could be two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| Not at one time, but they may reschedule and kick you on down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| That just goes with the nature of the beast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2707)|
| 0:45:11| It could be scheduled two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| A lot of times the judge will say, can't you all go outside and work this thing out before you ever get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| Sometimes you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| It may be one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| So there's that world of uncertainties, and like I tell every client, we can take care of business on this side of the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2723)|
| 0:45:32| When we walk through that door into that courtroom, all bets are off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| And when we leave, it is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| And I can't tell you that once we go inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| I've had judges and advisors tell me about particular cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| For example, I've actually had this told me to my face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| But the law is in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| The facts are in your favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| You're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| And they split the baby in the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| We didn't really lose the entire case, but who knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| So you just have to be ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| And then there are times you work into situations where we have bad facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| And it can cost us to try to save our employees from a situation where they actually followed the letter of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2775)|
| 0:46:22| they actually followed their training, they actually did the right thing, but in a jury trial it won't come out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2782)|
| 0:46:30| And so some of the costs are associated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| So I don't have an answer to you in terms of what you ought to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| Number one, I can't advise you on this anyway because you have counsel related to these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| I'm just talking about the bigger idea of the account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| So just to give you a feel of what that's really all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| Do you have a number in your head over the last two or three years, the average that you've used for this $650,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| How much of it do you have used for these different 6-7 legal liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| Probably less than half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| Less than half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2827)|
| 0:47:08| I'm guessing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| I'll have to go look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| I can tell you that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| I think that's the number whenever I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| But as I said, in the past I don't have these two cases that I do have this year, which could be a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2835)|
| 0:47:24| I'm not saying it for any other reason that I don't want to have to come back down here and say, hey, here we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2844)|
| 0:47:30| and I need $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| I just don't want to have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| And we fought real hard not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| So anyway, I'll get you a number and see what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2857)|
| 0:47:41| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| I'm not seeing any other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| I want to remind everybody that the motion that is on the floor is a motion to send forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| so it would not be on the consent agenda, and this is for the public at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| The final decision on this would actually be made at next Monday's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| Personally, not speaking as the chair, but just as another commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| I do not want to see the law department or a lot of other departments not be able to hire things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2890)|
| 0:48:16| with some of these things moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| We can discuss all this in greater detail next week, but anyhow, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| Oh, sorry, Commissioner Bussel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| Mr. Caldwell, our finance director, said he's not sure exactly what some of the bills are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| Is that correct, Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| The only thing that I have not saw would be court costs, and so that's the only thing that is left that is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| I can check with Chancery Court and see if they can give me an estimated figure on what that's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| I think they charge per page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| I'm not certain, but that's the only other piece that we haven't got yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| So will we have that cost when we put a number in here of what we're going to need to appropriate from you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2939)|
| 0:49:09| I'll ask Mr. Hogan this week if he can give me an estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| and then we could include it in this amount if that's the commission's desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2953)|
| 0:49:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| I think it would probably behoove us to get as many of the unknowns on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| including, as Commissioner Anderson said, the itemized bill from Arnett, Draper, and Haygood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2964)|
| 0:49:28| and if we can get either an actual or a close-to estimate on the court cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| just so that we've got some of those unknowns are clear by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| I know that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| I'll send the detailed invoice today or tomorrow to you all, and then I'll work on court costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2978)|
| 0:49:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Commissioner Carringer? All right. Your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| The motion before us is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| Item number 30, resolution 804, is authorizing the reimbursement of attorney's fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| previously paid by current or former employees of Knotts County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| as shown on the attached list, and in the total amount of $17,562.60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3013)|
| 0:50:19| in the lawsuit style, Knotts County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| versus Knotts County Retirement and Pension Board, et al.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| Knotts County Chancery Court, docket number 195-629-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Okay. Motion to send forward with no recommendation is from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| and there is a proper second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| Okay. Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Are these the only six current and former employees that we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| I just need to make sure, because I saw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| and I just wanted to understand that's what we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| All right. I do believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| Mr. Caldwell, you're nodding your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| That is correct. That's what we got as a listing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| and so that is the total and the only employees that paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Commissioner Gill, has your question been completely answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3076)|
| 0:51:17| The motion before us is to send forward with no recommendation to Monday for a final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| All in favor of this motion, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3085)|
| 0:51:26| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Okay. The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| Item number 36, Resolution 906,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| is authorizing the acceptance of the Administrative Office of the Courts'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| AOC Court Security Grant Award in the amount of $28,170| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| with the required matching funds in the amount of $3,130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Okay. There is a motion for approval from Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| and a second from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| Mike, I pulled this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| You'd sent us a great note providing some background for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| so I wanted to give you an opportunity to share with the public through this venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3124)|
| 0:52:08| as well as my fellow commissioners a little more information on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman and commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| Every day hundreds of people come into this courthouse for court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| It could be chancery. It could be circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| It might be a civil matter. It might be a criminal matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Obviously, courthouse security is a concern for everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| for the staff, for the judges, and for the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| I want you to know that we have an excellent, excellent court security team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| through the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| They work very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| They are very diligent, and everything from checking the people in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| all the way into the actual courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| We became aware of the fact that some money was being made available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| from the state for courthouse security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| and so I contacted the Sheriff's Department and said we should apply for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| They agreed, and so I worked very carefully with Hugh Holt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| to send in our application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| It was an application process because a lot of counties were vying for this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| And so we received notice that we had received the grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| and so we were excited about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| and so that's why we brought it to you here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| $23,400 will go for bulletproofing the clerk's area in our courtrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| The Administrative Office of the Court each year will provide a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| of what they consider to be the top courthouse security measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| that the courts need to take across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| and if we haven't taken those measures, then we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| and so they have provided some money to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| Currently, all of our judges' areas are bulletproofed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| but the clerks' areas are not, and that was one of the high priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| that the Administrative Office of the Courts put on each of the counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3217)|
| 0:53:42| And so this money will bulletproof our clerk areas in all of our courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| both civil and criminal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| We were also able to get some handheld detectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| and also some money for training for our court security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| The total amount of that is $28,170, but there is a 10% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| Now, at the time, we were under the gun to get this to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| so that we didn't miss out on the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| So in talking with Hugh, it was $3,130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3246)|
| 0:54:10| I told him we would cover that through my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| You're very generous in giving us $373,000 for our actual office operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| We have carved out $3,130 to be paid for the match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3258)|
| 0:54:23| so you will not take it out of your general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| We will pay for this through our office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| but it also will benefit our circuit, our chancery, our juvenile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| and also, of course, our criminal courts as well as our court security staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| So we're asking you for approval of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3274)|
| 0:54:36| and we thank you very much for accepting this money from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| and also the matching funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| Any of my fellow commissioners wish to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| The motion is, yeah, and great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| This motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3298)|
| 0:55:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Okay, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Item 37, Resolution 907,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| is expressed in support of the Tennessee General Assembly's ongoing effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| to eliminate any requirement for a comprehensive growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| either by statewide legislation or by a specific exemption for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3316)|
| 0:55:21| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3323)|
| 0:55:24| Okay, the motion was made by Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| and seconded by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| I know we'd like to have some discussion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Kim was here and expressed a request to weigh in during public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| and I said what we'll do is we'll wait until we get to this item on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| I also see Gerald Green from MPC here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| We'll probably, I'm sure you'd like to weigh in on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| although we haven't talked about that, but I see you're here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3349)|
| 0:55:52| so I'll probably call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| I also, knowing that we've got a large group of commissioners on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| we've all looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| This has been an item that has been top of mind for County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| for the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Knowing that the public is probably at home watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3366)|
| 0:56:11| one thing that I just wanted to do, I guess, to help tee up this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| is I pulled the original law, or a copy of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| as passed by the state almost 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| and I just wanted to take just a few minutes to read for the record the caption on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| And frankly, this is a lot for our folks at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| who may be watching this conversation more so than my peers on County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Also, this law was passed in response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| There was a whole lot of, and while we sometimes have discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3402)|
| 0:56:48| or disagreements with our counterparts in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| I want to remind everybody that compared to where we were 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3411)|
| 0:56:57| the city and the county really were not getting along that well at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| You had, at the time, there was a lot of what is commonly referred to as finger annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| that had been taking place, and you had folks who were being brought into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| who did not necessarily want that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| And it became a very intense discussion, both locally and at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| where you had rural versus urban counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| and a lot of discussion of wanting to find ways to control this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| This law that was passed that asked all counties to establish growth plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| was a result of some of those discussions that happened here and across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| Tennessee's Growth Policy Act, known as Public Chapter 1101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| created a growth planning process for local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| At the same time, it changed the state's annexation laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| to require consent outside cities' urban growth boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| The purpose, as stated by the General Assembly, for the act is to, and by bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| eliminate annexation or incorporation out of fear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3479)|
| 0:58:03| establish incentives to annex or incorporate where appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| more closely match the timing of development and or the provision of public services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| stabilize each county's education funding base,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| and establish an incentive for each county's legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3495)|
| 0:58:18| to be more interested in educational matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and minimize urban sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| While the focus of the act was to deal with Tennessee's tumultuous battles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| over annexation and incorporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| it was also an attempt to further the growth planning statewide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| This is a summary that came from the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| in reference to this law's passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| Since this law was passed, you had another law that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| that really kind of said no more annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| And if that law was the first step towards annexation on a statewide level basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| and we did a great plan in response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| a very detailed plan, a multi-page plan, which I've got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| that exceeded the requirements of that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| There were other laws, other counties that did something more simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| that was just establish growth areas, establish ag areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3550)|
| 0:59:13| That was sort of like the basic bare minimum that they had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| In the 108th General Assembly, though, which convened in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| which some of us were in office as commissioners at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| or this is probably something that was top of mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| At the 108th General Assembly, which convened in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| concerns from citizen groups prompted the debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| about whether the changes should be made in state's municipal annexation laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| which dated back to 1955.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| What happened is that a law was passed that basically said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| folks cannot be annexed unless it's by consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| And that sort of put a lot more teeth into one of the objectives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3592)|
| 0:59:57| of that original growth law that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| So those are some of the things that have gotten us to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| And then as we look at what MPC has been doing to try to do planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| there have been times where our partners at MPC have had limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| when maybe they wanted to do creative planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| As we've been trying to manage growth, we've had growth happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| in areas where it didn't match up at the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| And at least me personally, I felt like in order for us to do something new,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| because this planning stuff was dictated at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| for us to make any changes, there's also some provisions in this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| that said that it should be updated every few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| otherwise it almost by consent moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| So there's just so many moving parts to this, which has made it difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| frankly, to either update or create a new growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| or for us and our partners at MPC to really do a whole lot of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3646)|
| 1:00:52| And we've usually had to pass stuff at commission that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| well, we're passing something that's an exception to the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| really because this growth plan is almost 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| So I wanted to get all that out there, sort of tee up this conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| for my fellow commissioners and the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| So that's kind of where we've gotten here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| So that motion, with a lengthy soliloquy by Commissioner Nystrom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3671)|
| 1:01:17| is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| So what I'd like to do is see if there's any discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| And I'll entertain some discussion from the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| and Kim, I'll call on you in just a few minutes if that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3688)|
| 1:01:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| So go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| Any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| Were you on before me, Ms. Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| Go ahead, Commissioner Gill and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| I just simply wanted to hear from Director Green with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| before we move forward with this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| I'll go ahead and call in Commissioner Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| Excuse me, Mr. Green from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Gerald Green, Knoxville-Knox County planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| I think we all understand the limitations that the growth policy plan places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| on the planning for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| As Chair Nystrom said, the growth policy plan was prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| some 20 years ago and did not acknowledge the current trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| or anticipate the type of development pressures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| that Knox County is under now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| To say that we need to update the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| is probably an understatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| We need to update the plan and update the county's general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| which followed the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| The general plan was adopted in 2003 following the dictates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| I'm speaking now for the executive committee of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3777)|
| 1:03:02| Knoxville-Knox County Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| They have opined that the growth policy plan and the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| need to be updated to provide a direction for the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3790)|
| 1:03:15| and decisions that guide and direct development in the Knox County area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3795)|
| 1:03:22| that that updating needs to be done quickly with the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| of resources and assistance from the county commission to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| and that that plan needs to be updated before we jettison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| And that's their opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| They'll be speaking to you next Monday at your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| But their concern is that we need something to direct the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| and the development of Knox County to ensure that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| infrastructure to serve the development that occurs in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| that we identify places that are appropriate for employment centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| and preserve those places, provide the resources that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| employment centers need, roads, information highways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| as well as vehicle highways, to provide access to schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| to shopping areas from residential areas, to look at the way we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3854)|
| 1:04:19| Knox County to grow and the way it can grow efficiently and economically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| to best serve you as the county commissioners, the future commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| and the current and future residents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| They'll be able to state that better and more fully next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| without me as a messenger, but that's the gist of their direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| again, from the executive committee of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3880)|
| 1:04:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Do we have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| I know we've got Evelyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| Would you like to ask what you made the original motion to ask him to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| You hit the nail on the head to have a policy or something in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| before we actually make the decision to eliminate this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| because what kind of time frame would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| What would be the process to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| Because it would be countywide and more of an exhaustive look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| at how the county needs presently and in the next five to ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3914)|
| 1:05:20| to have something in place long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| And I would recommend that the county seriously consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| retaining a consultant to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Our staff is 20% less than it was a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| We have a number of development activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| We have the Hardin Valley Mobility Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| the John Sevier Scenic Highway Corridor Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3940)|
| 1:05:44| the Chapman Highway Strategic Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| We've been requested to do some planning initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| I'm sure we'll be involved with the North Shore project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| that Commissioner Jay is proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| We don't have to do it efficiently and effectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3956)|
| 1:05:59| I think a consultant and about a year to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| I can do additional research between now and next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| to get more information regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Thank you. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| When I was on the MPC, we were dealing with this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| of what you call urban sprawl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| and people had ideas of trying to control it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| Controlling development is almost like controlling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| the way water wants to flow downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| So people want to develop where they want to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Twenty years ago, it was a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| Right now, we have it right now that more communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=3998)|
| 1:06:42| are developing communities instead of subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| where they're planning around a certain, maybe, site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4005)|
| 1:06:51| to where you have, and I'll use my district out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| as downtown Powell, where they're redeveloping down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4016)|
| 1:06:59| where people want to meet, and you have Greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| and the Beaver Creek development and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4022)|
| 1:07:06| So it's changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| But the big thing is this was a state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| and we will have to get the state, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| to do it as a county project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| That's what happened last time when we tried to get it changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4040)|
| 1:07:24| We didn't send it in the right way or in the right language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4044)|
| 1:07:27| or have the right people to support this bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| So in doing that, like Mr. Green said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| the idea is you need a developer that's like in the Powell area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4054)|
| 1:07:41| We've got a group that is Enhanced Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| and they're trying to design their area out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| They meet, they discuss what they see for their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| within that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| And I guess what we're going to have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| is the way we do development now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| It's a lot different than what we did back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4078)|
| 1:08:00| I know we were putting lights in the courthouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| when I was on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| It's probably what you all want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| But we almost had bloodshed over trying to get everybody together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| to agree on how their land was to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| And what we do, we need somebody to advise us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| and go into the communities where there are communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| And you have communities in south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4103)|
| 1:08:25| You have two or three different communities out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| In north Knoxville, we have communities within our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| So we're probably going to have to just go by district by district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| and things like that to get people to agree on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| how they want their community to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| And we've got to take their ideas into our ideas to get things done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| because they're the people that's going to live in those communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| So in saying that, we do need some guidance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| on how we're going to construct what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| We just can't open it all up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4141)|
| 1:09:03| But we need to have an idea where we can see how growth is going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4143)|
| 1:09:09| and how we can fit the infrastructure to fit that growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| And that's what we tried to do years ago, and it fell flat on its face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4154)|
| 1:09:18| But you're going to have to have a review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| And I mean a really review because it was passed every three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| that we're supposed to review the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| It never was touched again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| That was in the agreement that's set forth by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| And the state didn't enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Now it's back on our shoulders, and we ought to do it right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| So anyway, whichever way that you go, you need to go community by community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| or maybe by district by district when you start your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| And that's going to be a big undertaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| It took over ten years before we could get it done when we started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4195)|
| 1:09:58| and it may even take even longer now with the way we're growing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4198)|
| 1:10:02| So let's do it right, and let's do it slowly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| and let's have the advice of how we should do it within the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| My suggestion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| This question is for Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| So is the Executive Board of the MPC basically opposed to this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| as it's currently stated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4230)|
| 1:10:34| I'd rather you ask that question of them directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| I'll state what I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| and there will be members of the Executive Committee here next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4239)|
| 1:10:43| at your regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4243)|
| 1:10:44| But they feel that the growth policy plan as currently formulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| does place some restrictions on their ability to make good decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| but they don't want that just eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| They want, as you've stated, the general plan updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| and then without the bounds of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| I think we need to talk with them more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| and probably with the law director and others is how we structure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| to have the updated general plan ready to go at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| that the growth policy plan is done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| And then also, is the Executive Board and your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| also aware of the Attorney General for the State of Tennessee's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4287)|
| 1:11:33| that was released in August of 2017 regarding the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4293)|
| 1:11:39| that it does not need to be updated every three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4299)|
| 1:11:43| Have you seen that document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| I've seen it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| I want to make it perfectly clear to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| that nobody on this commission is saying we do away with planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4314)|
| 1:11:59| I think it's very important that we have adequate, up-to-date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| and moving forward planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| and we've been held back by this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| I have a question for you, Director Green, and I may be wrong about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| but I think the statute said it was a 20-year plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| And we will be in year 20 in year 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| So this plan has to be updated anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| I would say it should have been updated years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| We're running on a 2003 general plan and a 2000 growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Those have changed greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| And I don't think anybody's saying we just drop the growth plan without anything in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| But we do have sector plans in place that could guide us for a year or two, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| But those sector plans fall under the umbrella of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| which falls under the growth policy, so they build on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| What we need to do is create a new foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4381)|
| 1:13:04| But I guess what I'm getting at is even though we have the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| which is going to have to be updated in less than a year probably by statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4386)|
| 1:13:14| since it was a 20-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| we will be following the guidance of the sector plan at some point until that gets done anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| And, again, we need that new foundation to guide the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4403)|
| 1:13:29| because now even the sector plans are restricted in some cases by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4409)|
| 1:13:34| But the way, as Commissioner Busler was saying, the way things are developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| the way people want community centers, it's not easy to do under the plan we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| And I concur with Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| We need the input of the communities, the entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| The community involvement in updating that plan is critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Is there any plans in place since the growth plan expires in 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| Have we taken any steps towards what we would do if we stayed under the growth plan and we hit that mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4442)|
| 1:14:09| We at staff level have talked about the need to update the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| but beyond that we haven't gone much further in terms of a process for doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| or the costs and resources needed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| I just want to, Mr. Green, if you could stay, just to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| I just want to be fairly clear because I feel like it's a little bit of who's on first and what's on second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| We have sector plans which are sort of super local, neighborhood by neighborhood, region by region, district by district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4483)|
| 1:14:49| You know, it's very, very focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4489)|
| 1:14:51| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Above that we have a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| That is for Knoxville, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| And then above that on a state level is a growth policy plan that is a state comprehensive look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| The growth policy plan is mandated by the state, the public chapter 1101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| but it is a Knox County growth policy plan that designates the urban area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| the urban growth boundary, planned growth area, and the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| So it's essentially the same as the general plan, just with a seal of approval from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| Less detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| So if we have a general plan that is Knoxville, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| and we have sector plans other than it is state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| why do we need a state level one that ultimately looks like almost a duplicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4538)|
| 1:15:44| with less information on a state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| Because to me this resolution seems like the conversation is about who is planning our planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4546)|
| 1:15:56| Are we able to plan and work on sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| and growth plans amongst a body of elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| and a group of experts in planning and growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| or are we then waiting for a state sort of pat on the head?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| I mean, to me this resolution reads as if we're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4572)|
| 1:16:17| thank you state, you wanted to do something, we had reason behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| you put it into place, nobody enforced it, nobody paid attention to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| and 20 years later it's kind of a worthless thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| so we can kind of handle planning on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4589)|
| 1:16:31| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| We'd like to remove ourselves from the state level and just focus on planning on a local level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Well, I think, and Commissioner Jay, you're looking at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| so I'm going to take the liberty of answering with my response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| Only because you had such a good diatribe at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Soliloquy, I prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| I think we had a lot of counties when that law was established at the state level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4611)|
| 1:16:56| that didn't have growth plans at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| and we had the issues related to annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| What they were trying to do when they passed this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4622)|
| 1:17:05| was to give the county commissions in each county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| here's the politics behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| they were trying to give the county commissions and the citizens at the county level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| a tool that they could use to say to the cities and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4633)|
| 1:17:17| you can't annex this area because it's not part of our plan for growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4637)|
| 1:17:23| And that was what they were, frankly, they were trying to create a tool for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| So they mandated it, and you'll see if you look at a copy of the actual plan that we sent to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4647)|
| 1:17:33| it is a pretty, even though we say it's simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| but it's a pretty detailed plan with the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| and I can only imagine that some of the other counties probably did something that was a lot more simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| with a highlighter on this area we're going to grow, this area we're going to preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| Well, that was the bare minimum requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| whereas we actually, the committee at that time did put a lot of effort into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| to craft a comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| The challenge is, as we've discussed, it's never updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| and in recent years it's really been non-applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| and it's held back both commission and our planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| Stop right there, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| If we were to take, let's take middle level of our local general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4688)|
| 1:18:14| and want to make changes to it, we would then have to submit it to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| and say please approve of this or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| Are we restricted by the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| What we're trying to do is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| We would not have to, the general plan would have to follow the guides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4707)|
| 1:18:33| or the standards that the growth policy plan dictated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| in terms of where growth can occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| and I think that's where the planning commission wants your assurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| that if you jettison that foundation that you have to update the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| to accommodate what Commissioner Busseler said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4730)|
| 1:18:54| work with the community to identify how those communities should grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| how those communities grow with the county purview in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| Let's not just jettison it, but let's create a new foundation for making our decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4743)|
| 1:19:07| But currently right now in the way we currently are structured,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| again I'm just trying to get some clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| if 20 years ago they looked at Hardin Valley and said this was a technology corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4754)|
| 1:19:22| and it didn't have a lot of residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| and 20 years later that plan has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| we don't have the ability to sort of go totally left turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| based on what the market is asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| because it's not in line with what's going on in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4778)|
| 1:19:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| Okay, so that's the restriction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| is that we're held by what was submitted at the state level 20 years ago and never updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| So could we function as a community in planning and growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4786)|
| 1:19:51| by having a general plan and sector plans without a state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4791)|
| 1:19:57| That's probably a change in the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| I think so, but I think it's imperative that as we do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| we update that general plan, revise that general plan to provide a direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| to acknowledge the changes and trends and conditions that have occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| where we want to go, the involvement of the communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| And one last question, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4815)|
| 1:20:17| and I'm sorry I'll relinquish the mic here just in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| but Chairman Nystrom, I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| If that's the case, is this resolution asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| basically saying we as a body are asking the state to let us out of that layer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| so we can focus on planning ourselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Is that what this resolution is asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| Or effectively, we could create a plan that would meet both requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4834)|
| 1:20:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| But we're asking to sort of remove ourselves from that layer first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| and Mr. Green is saying get the plan in place first and then ask for the removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4843)|
| 1:20:48| Is that where we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| Kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Ultimately, I think we all want a new plan is kind of where we all are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| and it's just a matter of what reason we're here is to discuss, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4855)|
| 1:20:58| how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4858)|
| 1:20:59| If we get exempted from that state law, that will allow us, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4859)|
| 1:21:03| to create our own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| I think I'm clear, but I may not be, and I apologize if I confuse it even further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4865)|
| 1:21:11| Sorry, I'm going to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| The law director has got his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| I'm going to go ahead and call him, Bud, real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| and then get back to the order that I recognized everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Commissioner Jay, you just spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Commissioner Anderson, you've already spoken on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| Okay, so it will be Jay, Anders, Biggs, and then Smith in that order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| Also, Kim Frazier had expressed an interest in speaking at public forum earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| and I made a commitment to her that I'd give her a chance to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| So what I want to do is, in fairness, give each commissioner a chance to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Then we'll have, for this topic, a version of public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| where I'll allow Kim Frazier to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| Now, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| The only reason I'm interjecting myself is I hear the dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4911)|
| 1:21:54| and I'm not sure that we're totally clear on what the issue is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| You have one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4920)|
| 1:22:04| Director Green has brought the idea, which is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4924)|
| 1:22:08| that if we get rid of the gross policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4928)|
| 1:22:11| we should have a plan put together by Knox County to take care of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4931)|
| 1:22:16| But currently we have a growth policy plan requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| and we don't have a growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| So to do what either Mr. Green wants done as a county or under the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4945)|
| 1:22:34| currently you are required to bring in Farragut, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4954)|
| 1:22:39| in Knox County to put together a growth policy plan by state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4959)|
| 1:22:46| If we keep the plan, in other words, if the legislature doesn't do anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4966)|
| 1:22:53| MPC is in a conundrum right now either way you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| and that's what the executive committee is trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| But you cannot cure their conundrum without, if you got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| I'm going to weigh in a little bit just on what the law director has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| If you look back at this original law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| and then forgive me I'm just using Chairman's discretion to weigh in on this as we work off our list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=4996)|
| 1:23:22| The way that law is written is that each plan has to be established by the county legislative body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5002)|
| 1:23:29| in partnership with each municipality inside of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| Since that law, and it goes back to since that law was passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| and that was because there was horse trading going on as it relates to annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5016)|
| 1:23:41| If we tried to update our current plan in accordance with the current state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| then we would begin a county-level planning process where we would have to incorporate Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| and the city of Knoxville to help us to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| when part of the concern around annexation has now been eliminated because of the follow-up law that was passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| So if we pass this to allow us to craft a new plan outside of that state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| that allows us to craft a planning document that would just be county-specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| because we no longer have the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| It would just be something that we as the county could plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| So I hope, Bud, have I just taken what you said and said it in English?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| Yeah, that's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| I just wanted the body to understand we're talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| Mr. Green was talking about a county plan, which we cannot do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| But if we abolish the urban growth plan, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5077)|
| 1:24:42| If you do not abolish the urban growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| you have to bring in all three parties and create a new urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5085)|
| 1:24:50| That's your two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| And I think that MPC is in the hard place right now of having nowhere to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| because the three bodies, by their own action, terminated their own plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5097)|
| 1:25:02| And not only have they not renewed it, they said it's dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5102)|
| 1:25:06| I'm not getting into any more of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| We're supposed to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| So legislatively, we need to get one, or you get rid of the urban growth plan and then we get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5110)|
| 1:25:18| But you're going to have to have something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| and currently you're required to have the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5120)|
| 1:25:24| That's where you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Yeah, Mr. Green, can you come back up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5128)|
| 1:25:32| We've talked about, through numerous meetings of zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| about needing to rid ourselves of the restrictions placed on us by the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| because we can't do cluster development where it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| We can't do the things that we need to do as a county to plan well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| You've said that yourself in zoning meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| and now you're coming to us tonight and saying we've fumbled a ball last year in legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5155)|
| 1:26:02| That was on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Now we're taking steps to fix it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| and the MPC is going to come and tell us that they may not want us to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5165)|
| 1:26:09| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| I don't think they're going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| I'm not sure what they want can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| What they would like is at the time the growth policy plan is done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5177)|
| 1:26:22| We, at that point, have another plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| We do have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| We have a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Well, let's adhere to that, update that, and put that end to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| I'm for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| I'm for mixed-use developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| I'm for everything you've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| but if they're going to muddy the waters in the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| when we sit here and talk about this legislatively for two years, I don't want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5198)|
| 1:26:43| I don't think they want to muddy the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| They want a commitment from you that as part of this effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| you'll make a commitment to provide the resources to update the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| We need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| We've talked about that for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| And if that could be part of this resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5216)|
| 1:27:01| This resolution just goes to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| It has nothing to do with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Another resolution that would say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5225)|
| 1:27:07| this commission will provide the resources and the support to update the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5227)|
| 1:27:12| What resources do we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| The basic one is money, you know, to hire a consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| What do we fund the MPC at every year as a county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5238)|
| 1:27:21| About 12% of our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| What does the city provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| And then the fees or the other 70-something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| Fees are about 16% to 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| And about 45% approximately comes from grant administrative funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Has the county ever not paid for their plans that they've asked for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| Not that I'm aware of, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| I think we've pretty committed to making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5267)|
| 1:27:49| I think you've got, over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| you've got an old group of commissioners that have committed to changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| and doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| We can't take that first step without eliminating the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| I'm in a difficult spot because I'm trying to speak for people who aren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| They should have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| If they're against it, they should have been here because this is a very important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| They're not against it, and I think you're misunderstanding there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| They are not against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| They understand the restrictions the growth policy plan have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5293)|
| 1:28:16| but they also understand the need for updating the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| and just want to be assured that there are resources available to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| We've never not done that, and we've talked about it for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| wanting mixed use, wanting all that corridor stuff we want to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| all the communities that are coming together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| We've talked about it for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| We're taking the first step, and now there's, given that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I think all they want is the second step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| just the commitment to provide the resources to update the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| And I would tell you history repeats itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| We've never not done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| I'll tell you this, Mr. Anders, if I might weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| The way we've got a resolution written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| and if you look at the resolution that we tried to get passed last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| it's, for lack of a better word, it's aggressive language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| that if you don't know in context the first time you read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| even our caption just to talk about this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| the way at first glance when you read it, it sounds like you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| that we just want to eliminate planning, which is not the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| But when you read the caption on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| I could get why some community members might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| and I'm not talking about you, Kim,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| but I can understand how the initial reaction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| even if I was an MPC commissioner, might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| what are they trying to tell us, we can't do planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| So I'm just trying to put that in context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| Mr. Anders, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| I just had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| What's the first steps of getting rid of the urban growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| as well as if that's not going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| how are we going to put together a committee with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| as well as Farragut so we can get something done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| And is there any way to get the data from the top three busiest areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| so whenever our plan, we know where we need to affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| Because I really do like Commissioner Bussler's idea of going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Is there somewhere where we can mine that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| and maybe have that by next week, Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| If you're speaking about the sectors of the community areas of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| that have the fastest growth, we cannot provide that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| Commissioner Biggs, if you don't mind if I weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Your question, as I heard it, was you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| how do we get this arranged where we're meeting with Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| and Farragut and some of the other municipalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| That is how the current law is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| And one of the outcomes that I'm hearing that we all would probably like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5435)|
| 1:30:39| to get to is where we can have the plan updated in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| because we have the issue-related annexation is no longer an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| unless people opt in, with a new law or exempting us from the current state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| that gives us the opportunity to pass really just a county-level growing policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| that we wouldn't, it's not that we don't care about the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| it's just that most of our issues are outside of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| And we want to get to a point where we can establish a planning group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| or do planning that's really county-specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| So that's one of the outcomes of getting this done correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| is we don't have to go back to the old way that they did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| where we get everybody trying to horse trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| So this is the first steps of getting rid of the urban growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| kind of what we're doing tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Okay, that's all I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Now, as I've said, I told Kim Frazier, who had requested to speak at public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| at the very beginning of the meeting, and thank you for staying until this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| yet out of respect to my fellow commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| I did want to give them the first chance to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| So now your public forum on this matter, you can approach the podium to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| I know you've got a lot of information that's probably already on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| You've addressed most of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| You can go ahead and address commission on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| I'm Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| If you go really long, I'm going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| I talk really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| I'm Kim Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| I'm with the Hardin Valley Planning Advocates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| and you've already covered a lot of what I was going to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| simply because, unlike you, many people in the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| they're unaware that the county actually has a comprehensive growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5528)|
| 1:32:12| and that it has just been outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| And so things that I want to talk about that are important to us as you move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5534)|
| 1:32:19| and things that we would like to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| I feel like this is kind of the appropriate time to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| And since you all understand that there is a conundrum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| and I have witnessed it firsthand sitting in NPC meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| and then county commission meetings when it comes to land use zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| there are a lot of issues that I don't even know that I'm trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| what level of plan we're trying to address is going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5563)|
| 1:32:48| But one thing I do want to say is there was a lot of planning going into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5568)|
| 1:32:53| that comprehensive growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| and I think there were possibly 26 public forums, 37 additional committee meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5576)|
| 1:33:02| an organizational meeting, even those in 1998.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| There's some good stuff in that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| There's some bones there that I think we could use as a launching pad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5587)|
| 1:33:11| to review and revise the general plan and then going even further down into sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5591)|
| 1:33:19| And as we have requested, and Commissioner Anders has sponsored a small area plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| it's just really taking a broad snapshot and then funneling it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| I think where we kind of lost out was when the state removed the penalties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| of implementing and keeping your plan up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| When they removed the penalties to not complete your growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| one of those was making certain counties ineligible for state grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| At that time, that's when Knox County just stopped doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5630)|
| 1:33:55| They just stopped doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| And that's where, as a county, we all suffered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| So you fast forward 20 years and here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5641)|
| 1:34:03| We're still trying to figure out where do we go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| Another issue that we have is that there is no accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| and responsibility for any of the growth plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| I've read them until I'm blue in the face,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| and believe me, that's not what I want to do on the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| But there are beautifully designed plans, especially sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5660)|
| 1:34:24| that you keep referring to, but nothing's happening with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| I've read them. Our county is behind them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| We were a part of developing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| My name is in this book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| And they're used as a convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| I've seen it time and time again where I will sit an MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| and an amendment will be asked of a sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5690)|
| 1:34:55| and there will be opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| There will be someone there for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5698)|
| 1:35:04| Let me just say, whomever it benefited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| that determined if the sector plan was valid or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| Meaning whoever was standing at the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| either opposing it or supporting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| that determined if the sector plan was merely just a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5717)|
| 1:35:24| a guideline, or something that we follow and are in compliance with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5724)|
| 1:35:31| That's a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| There's no responsibility. There's no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| Whenever you do get into these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| we would ask you to please consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5742)|
| 1:35:47| These should not be just recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| There is so much time, effort, and engagement with these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5750)|
| 1:35:55| Like you all have stated, the community wants to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| That is the only opportunity that communities have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| to voice the vision for their area or the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5762)|
| 1:36:08| and their recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| I have more questions than I do actually information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| because you all have shared that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| I was going to do that, but you've already done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5778)|
| 1:36:25| You've answered the question, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| I just wanted an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| Why couldn't we use the Comprehensive Growth Policy Plan as a starting point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5792)|
| 1:36:37| I'm a rule follower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| Everything that I have read and I have tried to find,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| and Mr. Armstrong stated that, too, we're in a conundrum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| because it's a law that we have a plan and we don't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5807)|
| 1:36:56| So what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| Then I also wanted to state that, I don't know if you all are aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| but there are processes in place for updates to policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| including zoning and coding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5828)|
| 1:37:12| We could currently introduce new policies and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| that would present new creative developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| like cluster developments and mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| That's something to consider as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Then you get into the fact that the county hasn't reviewed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| the county zoning and codes since the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5848)|
| 1:37:36| For instance, in Hardin Valley, we have a large agricultural parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| On the very corner that's surrounded by other farmland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| it's zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| So your resolution mentions referring to the sector plans as guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5871)|
| 1:37:58| Again, you should already be doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| so I don't consider that to be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| I guess I'm asking, are you stating that you're willing to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| the sector plans into full enforce and effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| at both MPC and county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| and hold both parties accountable while you do develop a new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5898)|
| 1:38:25| That's a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| I'll answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| There are things that we can't do under the current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| The sector plan, MPC recommends most of the sector plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| are approved by the MPC board and the staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5919)|
| 1:38:44| I don't want to say most of them, but a lot of them are approved by them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| because of changing trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| Every plan is going to be fluid at one time or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| You still have a general plan that dictates the sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| if the urban growth plan is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| So it's not like we have no plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| To say we have no plan is we have three plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| two of them work against each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| which is the general growth plan and what we need to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| I'm sorry, the state plan and what we need to do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| That's working against us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| So to say let's just take a parcel in Hardin Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| that's inside the urban growth boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| and it would be a great place for a town center or a cluster development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5969)|
| 1:39:33| we can't do that under the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| So even if we come up with our own general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| it's against the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| And so you've got to get rid of the urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| to develop our general plan for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| So you can't have a cluster development in that urban growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| if it's still in effect if that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| So you've got to take a step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| This is the step that doesn't eliminate the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| it doesn't eliminate the sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Everything will remain the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| other than some of the restrictions in the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| But we can't move, we can't take that first step without getting ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| because the city and Farragut are not coming to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| They have no desire to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6014)|
| 1:40:16| It doesn't affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| It affects our future growth and planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| And that's why we have to start that process to take it off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| and redo our general plan, do mixed use and cluster developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| and the things that we'd like to do that we can't do inside the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| Having said that, and based on the General Assembly's response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6033)|
| 1:40:37| to procedures available to a county in a municipality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| to amend a comprehensive growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| if its coordinating committee is unavailable or is undesired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| it states a county must create an alternate entity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6049)|
| 1:40:53| to perform the functions of the coordinating committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| Has that been considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| If I might weigh in, I think I'm familiar with exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| what you're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| One thing I might reference is that Gerald Green had also suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| bringing in a consultant that could possibly function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| in somewhat of that capacity as well to help lead something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| just referencing a recent discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| But, yeah, I'm personally familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| And then I wanted to ask, the term restrictive has been tossed around a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| when referring to the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| And I guess I just wanted to ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| can anyone tell me how it's restrictive and to whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| Any piece of land that's inside that urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| If you wanted to cluster a piece of property that's inside that urban growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6096)|
| 1:41:41| Gerald, correct me if I'm wrong, the density changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| And so instead of having a cluster of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| you've got multiple houses over a bigger piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| Is that the restriction that we mainly deal with in our growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| The plan would allow clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| What it does is limit the density in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6118)|
| 1:42:01| The density is limited to two units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| And under our planned residential zoning, it allows clustering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| or other forms of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| But where that development can occur is mandated by the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| What was a rural area, imagined as a rural area 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| may not be appropriate for rural development now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| And that's why we have to update our general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| to better identify growth patterns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| and where we want growth to go in the next 5 or 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| I would tell you if we stuck with our sector plans all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| you wouldn't have a Hardin Valley Elementary High School or Middle School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| because you wouldn't have a need because the sector plan didn't call for any of that 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| The sector plan called for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| Well, not 10 years, not 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| The one before the 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| Not until after they built Pellissippi State, which drove the growth out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| But, I mean, you have to be fluid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Oh, I absolutely agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| But there's still an accountability problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6182)|
| 1:43:09| So the reason I ask you about restriction is because in our group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| we communicate with developers on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| And Ms. Fraser, if you don't mind, we need to kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Sure. I just want to make sure that the term being restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| that it's not a response to developers wanting less restrictions on zonings and land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| and fewer required improvements to developments during construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| and more opportunities to purchase land cheaply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| and make it valuable to them with no concern for infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| because then it falls back onto the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Are you prepared to address those infrastructure improvements that would come along with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6224)|
| 1:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Thank you for your patience, Ms. Fraser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Moving on, I had Commissioner Smith and in order of the lights that I received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| was Smith, Bussler, Gill, Schoonmaker and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| Schoonmaker hadn't talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| Have you not talked on this subject yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| He has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| Yeah, he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6250)|
| 1:44:11| Yeah, I think he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| But Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6255)|
| 1:44:17| Is the problem this for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| We can't pass a general growth plan as long as we have the urban growth plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| because it will contradict it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6268)|
| 1:44:36| Gerald, you said we haven't passed a general plan since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6276)|
| 1:44:41| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6281)|
| 1:44:42| General plan, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| Why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| All I can imagine is no one was willing to undertake the effort to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| That and it was pretty much guided under the umbrella of the urban growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6291)|
| 1:44:55| There probably wasn't a whole lot of change that could have been made to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6295)|
| 1:45:03| I think there was enough room to better reflect what we wanted in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| There were some limits, but there was opportunity even under the growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| to address some of the things that Commissioner Anders talked about, mixed use, more clustering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| But those broad limits are still there where the density can occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| You basically broke down into three categories, rural, growth and urban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| And according to the growth plan, you cannot assign or change any zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| that do not fit into the existing categories of those regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| So there wouldn't be a whole lot of things you could change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| You can change outside the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6340)|
| 1:45:47| You could address, again, the mixed uses and more different approaches to development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| You're right that the density, which is a key element,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| cannot be addressed without changes to the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| The city is currently going under recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| With the urban growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| there is no way the county can undertake any kind of massive rezoning like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| with this plan and have any real effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| We could update our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| They would still have to match up into the categories and existing zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| We could better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I'll use the example of the amendment that's coming before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6385)|
| 1:46:29| I think the next item or one second item after this one is addressing just the standards for hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6389)|
| 1:46:37| going from a 1960s standard for hotels to a modern standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| So there are lots of tweaks we could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| but we'd still have that overarching density limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| limitation of where commercial and industrial lands could be designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6406)|
| 1:46:51| And the growth plan 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| the way it's set up, as our utilities have expanded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| we haven't been able to utilize land to its fullest in a way that probably could in some ways help it sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6421)|
| 1:47:11| We could better match utilities with infrastructure with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| That's another reason to update the general plan is to better assess where our infrastructure is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| and to ensure that development is in sync with the infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| Or look at where development trends are heading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| and ensure that infrastructure providers are aware of that and provide the infrastructure in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| All right. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Going back on just a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| Number one, state law always trumps county law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6465)|
| 1:47:51| So if we go against state law, then we can be sued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6471)|
| 1:47:58| and then it's going to cost us money because we're not following what the state told us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6478)|
| 1:48:05| It also can control development because a person says, well, they're not following that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6485)|
| 1:48:11| We can sue the developer to stop him because they're not following the plan as we asked them to do at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6491)|
| 1:48:19| All these things can come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6499)|
| 1:48:20| So the main thing we have to do is get the state's permission to do what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| That's why you have to do away with this plan that we have before us right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| Get rid of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6510)|
| 1:48:31| Then we can do our county like we're supposed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| And I guess that's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| And in other areas where you're developing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| there's things out there that you're going to see a lot different development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6521)|
| 1:48:46| even from what we've got right now and what people want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| We've just got to be flexible enough to change quickly and give out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| Gerald has to follow the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| I mean, he can't change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6536)|
| 1:48:58| He has to follow it as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6538)|
| 1:49:00| That's why they come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| So anyway, let's do a plan that's for the county and for the benefit of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6548)|
| 1:49:09| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6549)|
| 1:49:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6551)|
| 1:49:12| I just need to make the observation because I serve a district who really is in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| And the density, mixed use, and clustering impacts the constituents I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6557)|
| 1:49:23| So I need to acknowledge that we must have a plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| And I know the exhaustive effort of RECODE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| the county needs the nine commissioner visions around this table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6570)|
| 1:49:35| in order to set really a vision for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| But we're going to need somebody to help us with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| And I think I just need to make sure I acknowledge the direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6582)|
| 1:49:46| and the level of work and commitment that it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| I think I'm probably the only commissioner sitting here that back in 98-99| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| attended 90% of the 26 growth policy coordinating committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6602)|
| 1:50:08| So I've got a pretty good background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6608)|
| 1:50:10| But what I'd like to suggest to commissioners before next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6610)|
| 1:50:14| there's a great website that you can go to for additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| if you want to write this link down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| It's tn.gov forward slash TACIR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| That's T-A-C-I-R, which is the Tennessee Advisory Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| on Intergovernmental Relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| And then after TACIR, you put forward slash annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| And that will tell you everything you need to know about public chapter 1101,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| how to update your growth plan, everything you need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| But do not, when you go to the home page for TACIR, do not click on, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6649)|
| 1:50:55| I think it says public chapter 1101 because some of those links aren't active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6655)|
| 1:51:00| So go to where it says annexation in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| I know my fellow commissioners are good at computers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| but would you mind posting a link on our forum so that you can direct us directly there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| Sure, I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| But they've done extensive research on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6673)|
| 1:51:15| All right, thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| Let's see, Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| As we were saying, it had been since 2003 since we'd passed a general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6684)|
| 1:51:30| And you think some of that was really because housing and development, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6690)|
| 1:51:36| went into a big slump right about that time around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| And then it just started, you know, getting built back up and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| in terms of us not passing or putting it on the back burner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6706)|
| 1:51:52| I mean, you know, just because I know all commissioners before us have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| this has been an issue with them and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| and I just wondered if there was some of that that we think might have caused us not to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6720)|
| 1:52:08| Go ahead, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| I was going to mention something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| but those two years that that body was doing that process was a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6732)|
| 1:52:20| I mean, it was, I mean, I went there specifically to prevent 27 residential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6740)|
| 1:52:28| on Westland Drive from being annexed to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| After going to all those meetings and for two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| the city annexed zero of those 27 subdivisions because somebody showed up to speak out against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6755)|
| 1:52:42| But those people that served on that coordinating committee were so grateful when that thing ended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| because it was a nightmare, and that's why I don't think the county has wanted to do this all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6768)|
| 1:52:57| Well, I know my district had a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6777)|
| 1:53:00| In fact, in my county area, we have a lot of finger annexation by the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6780)|
| 1:53:08| and then I also have several constituents that have volunteered to be in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| So my subdivisions out there are mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| Okay, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| I just wanted to go ahead and let the other members of the commission know that Thursday at 1 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| Commissioner Carringer and Beeler and myself will be meeting with Ms. Frazier at Littons at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| That's 2803 Esri Drive in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| All right, if anyone else would like to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6822)|
| 1:53:45| Yeah, just based on Commissioner Biggs' comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| I would like to make a motion that we move with no recommendation since all of the discussion that we've had on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| You read my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| So who made the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| I'll change my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6840)|
| 1:54:01| I'll change my motion to no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6841)|
| 1:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| So the motion before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith, you've got a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6849)|
| 1:54:12| It was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6852)|
| 1:54:13| Was that Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| Does your second agree with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6856)|
| 1:54:17| So now the motion that is now before us is to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6857)|
| 1:54:24| That is the current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| However, we will now move on to discussion of that matter, which is still ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| But the matter before us has now been updated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6870)|
| 1:54:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6875)|
| 1:54:37| I just wanted to let Director Green and the members of the Metropolitan Planning Commission know that as representatives and elected officials to commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6877)|
| 1:54:46| it is our goal and desire to make Knox County as fruitful and as great as it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6886)|
| 1:54:53| We don't live in a planning world, but we live in the real world with people every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| And we have neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6898)|
| 1:54:59| We have people that we live close to, community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| And it is our goal to do this is to make Knox County a better place, not just an easier place for people to develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6904)|
| 1:55:13| a place that we can put together real plans that fit the society we're headed towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6929)|
| 1:55:30| Mr. Green, I'm going to ask you a question a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Are you okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6932)|
| 1:55:33| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| This is the first time I ever heard you ever agree with anything that I've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| Well, I agree with most of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| I certainly agree and appreciate Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| And, you know, I think my goal, and I've talked with Commissioner Smith a great deal, is to make this a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6942)|
| 1:55:47| a great place where development is easy, where we have more agreement on where the county wants to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| and we don't end up with me getting inundated with emails opposing the projects that we have coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6953)|
| 1:56:01| And the people understand where development is occurring, the type of development that occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| and it's an easy path for developers to receive approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| Maybe I'm dreaming a bit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6970)|
| 1:56:12| Maybe I'm not okay in answer to Commissioner Busser's question when I dream about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6972)|
| 1:56:16| But that's the goal that I have, and I think the Planning Commission and the rest of the planning staff have for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6976)|
| 1:56:22| And we appreciate working with the commissioners and hearing the dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| because that's an important part of enabling us to understand what we need to do and how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| And, as chair, I might weigh in, and then we'll have a vote of seeing no more lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| But I guess one thing I want to make sure everybody knows that me personally that I've heard is, yes, we need some updated plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=6997)|
| 1:56:44| And I guess this commission wants to send the community, as well as our partners at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7004)|
| 1:56:50| is we're not trying to get rid of planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| And I know that the document is worded in a way that makes you almost think that maybe that's one of our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7013)|
| 1:56:58| And as we get to making final votes next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| that may be something that this board can also entertain is some additional language to make that intention crystal clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7022)|
| 1:57:13| So with that said, the motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7033)|
| 1:57:19| All in favor of this motion, which I've restated three times, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7044)|
| 1:57:25| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7045)|
| 1:57:27| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7047)|
| 1:57:29| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7049)|
| 1:57:31| Item 38, Ordinance O-19-1-101 is amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 2, Section 42 through 53,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7051)|
| 1:57:42| entitled Merit System Council, by replacing the word disability with absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| And so Section 42-53B to enable the chair of the Merit System Council to designate the alternate member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7067)|
| 1:57:54| to sit in place of any regular member who is absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7074)|
| 1:57:58| This amends Ordinance O-9E-9-111, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7078)|
| 1:58:03| O-91-8-114, adopted November 25, 1991.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| And Ordinance O-95-4-101, adopted April 24, 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7095)|
| 1:58:17| Make a motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7099)|
| 1:58:20| Okay, the motion has been made by Commissioner Anders and the second is by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7105)|
| 1:58:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7106)|
| 1:58:27| All right, we do have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7107)|
| 1:58:28| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| I was just curious if there was somebody here from the Merit Council that could help explain a bit of the context of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| We can have that next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| I spoke with Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| I do have someone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7117)|
| 1:58:38| I spoke with Jim Jr. about this earlier, but go ahead if you'd like to go ahead and approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| I know Jim Jr. had called me about this, but go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7121)|
| 1:58:44| If you'd like to go ahead while we're in the discussion mode, please provide some insight on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| I get it, but for the benefit of our community and the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| I'm Paula Taylor, Director of the Merit System Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Currently, the alternate member cannot vote on anything unless there is another member out due only to a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7135)|
| 1:59:06| So if they're not there for a vacation or being sick or anything like that, it has to be a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| The council is wanting to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| If they're out for any reason, then the chairperson can have the alternate vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7155)|
| 1:59:22| Just to explain why we sent it without recommendation, Paula, the ordinance has to be voted on in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| so it can't be on consent, so it's going to come back up anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| So we'll vote on it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| That's the reason it's going without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| I think everybody's for it and understands it, but process-wise, that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| And thank you for explaining that because that was clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| It was very inefficient, what was going on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| All right, the motion before us is to send this forward with no recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| to be finally voted on at next week's official meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| All in favor of this, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7196)|
| 1:59:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7199)|
| 2:00:01| Item number 39 is Ordinance 0-19-1-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| amending the Knox County Code Appendix A Zoning, Article 5, Section 5.32, CB Business and Manufacturing Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7206)|
| 2:00:13| regarding lot area requirements for hotels, motels, and transient mobile home parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7213)|
| 2:00:18| This amends Ordinance 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7218)|
| 2:00:24| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7226)|
| 2:00:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Okay, the motion to send forward with no recommendation has been made by Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| and a proper second has been made by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| Yes, Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7239)|
| 2:00:41| Because Director Green might not be here when we vote on this next Monday, would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7241)|
| 2:00:51| I will be here next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| You're so important that nothing else could keep me away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| This was requested, actually, by a commissioner who I heard from some developers in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7258)|
| 2:01:04| Our current standard for hotels, motels, and transient lodging is based in the 1960s model of a motor court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7264)|
| 2:01:12| where the occupant lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7272)|
| 2:01:14| There's a requirement for land area that's 7,500 square feet for the owner, managers, residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7274)|
| 2:01:21| and then 1,800 square feet for each unit of land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| What would now be considered a smaller, average-sized hotel, 60 rooms would require two and three-quarters acres for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7286)|
| 2:01:35| which is not realistic in today's economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| We're placing a burden upon those who want to provide lodging facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| and this amendment would bring our standard in line with those of other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| and better enable developers to take advantage of opportunities for lodging facilities here in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7313)|
| 2:02:01| Thank you. Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7322)|
| 2:02:03| Where are our business and manufacturing zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| They're the CB zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| They're scattered quite liberally throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7327)|
| 2:02:14| Often they're along Kingston Pike in the county's jurisdiction, Clinton Highway, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7334)|
| 2:02:23| pretty much every corridor that exits from the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7343)|
| 2:02:27| so pretty much any place where a hotel would be looking is zone CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7347)|
| 2:02:36| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| Are there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| Okay, the item is properly before us to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| Okay, the agenda was amended to hear Item 42 next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| which is a presentation by Commissioner Jay on a North Shore Safety and Connectivity Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7380)|
| 2:03:07| Motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| It's a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| If it pleases the Chair, I'd like to take the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| Go right ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7396)|
| 2:03:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7410)|
| 2:03:31| Good evening, my fellow commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| I've come before you to present the North Shore Safety, Wellness, and Connectivity Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| and I would ask if our commission office team could maybe just bring up the proposal PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| I might refer to a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| Please, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| As public servants and representatives of the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| we're charged with the significant responsibility of overseeing public welfare, education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7433)|
| 2:03:58| infrastructure, and many other things, but most importantly, public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7438)|
| 2:04:03| Last summer I was driving down North Shore Drive just past the Cove Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7443)|
| 2:04:07| when I saw a family walking down the side of the road practically in the ditch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| It looked as if they were going to the park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| but I found it pretty alarming they were trying to navigate such a busy stretch of roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7454)|
| 2:04:18| that has little to no shoulder and a significant amount of high-speed traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| Over the next few weeks, I asked several neighborhood constituents in and around that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| if they ever walked or rode their bike to the Cove Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| Most said the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7471)|
| 2:04:33| They've all tried it once and will never again risk the journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7473)|
| 2:04:37| Those interactions led to an idea which is now before you today for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| This is a public safety project that I believe is a great investment of Knox County's resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7481)|
| 2:04:46| and worthy of your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7486)|
| 2:04:48| The North Shore Safety, Wellness, and Connectivity Project is a unique opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| to dramatically improve the safety in one of the busiest corridors in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| improve the health of residents, and connect two major corridors of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7496)|
| 2:05:01| to recreation and to commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7501)|
| 2:05:04| You've been presented with a comprehensive packet of information that outlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| how this project can improve roadway safety for drivers and neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7507)|
| 2:05:12| increase healthy access for over 10,000 people to a wonderful Knox County asset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7512)|
| 2:05:17| and further connect people and neighborhoods to over 350 local businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7517)|
| 2:05:22| This project is a public safety investment that will significantly decrease the potential risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7522)|
| 2:05:26| of dangerous accidents between pedestrians and motorists and enhance the quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| Early in the idea process, I brought this project to both Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7531)|
| 2:05:38| and Parks and Recreation, both of which are here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| I appreciate their attendance, and both of which thought it was worthy of consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7541)|
| 2:05:46| I want to commend the teams in both departments who analyzed the data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| conducted a comprehensive review, and provided valuable information along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7549)|
| 2:05:53| After working closely with them, I'm convinced both departments are full of true professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| who are interested in developing a better Knox County for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| As part of the due diligence process this fall, the Knox County Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| conducted a traffic study in the stretch of North Shore Drive for a one-month period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7565)|
| 2:06:09| and found the average daily traffic is over 11,000 vehicles per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7569)|
| 2:06:13| with an average operating speed of over 50 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| That data, of course, is available for your review in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| Additionally in your packet, please take note of the graph outlining the crash data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| related to this portion of North Shore Drive between 2015 and 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| As you'll see, 32.9% of the accidents were noted as, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7590)|
| 2:06:36| not collision with motor vehicle in transport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| I was a little confused by this, so the engineering team translated for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7599)|
| 2:06:44| where it basically means accidents where a motorist veers off the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| or catches a wheel on the edge of the road where there's no shoulder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| and essentially drives into the ditch or off the side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| exactly where people are trying to walk down North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7614)|
| 2:06:58| The potential for a fatal accident along this corridor is high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| but we have an opportunity to create a safer path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| Before you tonight is a line item transfer in the next agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| which is a request to get this project off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| Thanks to the significant investment by the State of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| into the Behavioral Health and Urgent Care Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| Knox County has some approved capital funding that was not needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| to complete that important project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| So tonight I'm asking you to approve the line item transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| and now designate those funds still in our coffers to this North Shore safety project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7644)|
| 2:07:31| If the transfer is approved, this will provide the resources necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7651)|
| 2:07:33| to conduct a formal design and complete the easement and acquisition portion of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7653)|
| 2:07:38| which is expected to be complete by the end of this fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7658)|
| 2:07:41| The estimated timeline for completion of the project, once fully funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| is the end of 2019 or early 2020, hopefully in time for the holiday festivities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| or at latest in time for springtime outdoor activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7669)|
| 2:07:53| Our mayor is supportive of this safety project and has agreed to put the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| for needed construction in the next fiscal year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7676)|
| 2:08:00| But additionally, with support from engineering and Parks and Rec,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| during the project we will continue to seek grant support from outside groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7683)|
| 2:08:07| to help supplement the funding needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| potentially further reducing the final fiscal investment from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| I hope you'll see the importance of this project and the potential to improve safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| in Knox County with an investment that will last for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| Thank you for your consideration and I'd be happy to answer any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| whether from here or if I need to go back to the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7703)|
| 2:08:27| Thank you. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| First, I'd like to compliment you, Commissioner Jay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7711)|
| 2:08:35| on an outstanding proposal and working with the community and getting the feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| and then taking it a step further to working with our team with Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7720)|
| 2:08:45| and also with our Director of Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| North Shore Drive is a major, major thoroughfare that a lot of the people in the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7729)|
| 2:08:56| do not realize how much traffic is on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7736)|
| 2:09:01| Also, I'd like to just mention, since we're mentioning Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7741)|
| 2:09:05| they're going to start in February of a safety project from the roundabout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| for the first 2,000 feet to the west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| which will help to hopefully prevent some of those people that veer off the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| and then back onto the road again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| But when I first got on commission, I said that was one of the things I wanted to do was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7761)|
| 2:09:27| like, hey, what can we do with North Shore Drive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| And then I was told it was a $60 million project to do what needed to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7769)|
| 2:09:33| and right away I realized that's probably the next 10 years for the Engineering Department's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7773)|
| 2:09:38| But anyways, I think what you've proposed is going to be a valuable asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7778)|
| 2:09:43| to not only the folks that live in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| but also for the ones that come to our premier park at the Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| And I think you're on the right track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| and anything we can do to assist you, we're there for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Anders and Biggs, I wasn't sure whose light came on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| Okay, I'll go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7806)|
| 2:10:08| Just looking at the map, is this also utilizing the bridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7808)|
| 2:10:14| What section would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| Yeah, essentially you've got, if you look at the very first map that I have in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| laying the entire project out, you have sort of phase one and phase two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7819)|
| 2:10:22| Essentially you have from the bridge back to the Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| and just a little bit into the Cove you have essentially bike trails, greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7827)|
| 2:10:32| and then it stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| It basically stops on the west end of the Cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| and it stops on the east end of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| And essentially this project would go from the Choteau Circle to the Cove on the west end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7838)|
| 2:10:47| and then from the bridge further to Concord Circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| where TDOT is currently expanding Concord Road with four lanes plus sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7851)|
| 2:10:57| into that circle, and it would connect up to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7857)|
| 2:11:00| One of the interesting innovative things that the engineering department floated the idea for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7860)|
| 2:11:04| and really thinks is quite possible is at the end of that bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7864)|
| 2:11:07| instead of actually crossing over North Shore and, again, creating that traffic hazard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| having the ability to sort of go and loop under the bridge and then back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7872)|
| 2:11:16| to connect to another little path and then bring it on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| So you would essentially not have to cross over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7880)|
| 2:11:23| There would be other parts down further in North Shore that you may have to cross over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| depending on what neighborhood you live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| That would be addressed differently, but yes, it would continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| And essentially from any of those neighborhoods or that park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| you would be able to walk or ride or rollerblade or whatever you do all the way to Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7895)|
| 2:11:43| if you wanted to, Kingston Pike and over, and then, of course, all the way back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| and then other connected neighborhoods through that Choteau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| So some of it would be in the town of Farragut then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7909)|
| 2:11:51| None of this project, as it's currently planned, is in the town of Farragut at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| This is completely Knox County and Knox County only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| All right. Thank you. Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| Yes, sir. Have we looked at TDOT? I mean, this is all on a TDOT road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| Have we looked at TDOT to see if their partnership is available for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7925)|
| 2:12:10| That's what we're going to proceed with next, and that's one of our outside grant partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7930)|
| 2:12:14| I think both TDOT and some other Greenway partners that may be interested in fulfilling this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| but essentially we wanted to get the process started with a formal design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| and some of the easement and right-of-way and acquisition parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| which is essentially the funding we're looking to be transferred into this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7945)|
| 2:12:29| The overall estimates, the budget, the partnership, that will all come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7949)|
| 2:12:33| and we may have answers to that before it actually hits the next fiscal year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| But, yes, that's one of our first calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| We just wanted to kind of put the ball in motion before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7959)|
| 2:12:43| The reason I ask is because we have a list of safety projects around our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7963)|
| 2:12:48| that we fail to meet constantly, and so to prioritize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7968)|
| 2:12:53| I mean, I think this is awesome. I think it's a great plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7973)|
| 2:12:57| but to prioritize it over our school safety projects without any TDOT participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| is maybe a little bit quick to quick draw there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| Well, all I can tell you is that we will be approaching TDOT and other partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| but I don't have that answer yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| This project is not necessarily meant to supplement any of the important projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| that are going on in the county right now that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=7996)|
| 2:13:20| This is simply seeing a need and finding a way that we might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8000)|
| 2:13:24| I think it's wonderful. I think it's necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8004)|
| 2:13:28| but I hesitate to commit to something that we have a school safety prior to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8008)|
| 2:13:35| Here comes Jim. He's going to talk to me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| He may ask Amanda for some money. I don't know if he can do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8018)|
| 2:13:41| Come on down, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8021)|
| 2:13:44| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter. I just want to clarify anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8024)|
| 2:13:47| Everything, the state route turns 90 degrees and goes on Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8027)|
| 2:13:51| so everything that we would be building would be on the county maintained road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| It wouldn't be within any state jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| I thought it was North Shore Drive, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8038)|
| 2:14:01| It is. North Shore, the state route 131 turns and goes 90 degrees on Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8041)|
| 2:14:09| Everything to the west of the roundabout on North Shore to the county line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| is a county maintained road. The state doesn't have any jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| I'm looking at the wrong area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| I just want to make sure about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| We did talk about discussing the connected parts to the Concord Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8059)|
| 2:14:24| and approaching them there, so I don't think they would look to fund other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| but they may still be a partner in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| This is more west than I thought. I was thinking it was more east toward the Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8069)|
| 2:14:33| I still think we need to look at our safety priorities that we have around our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8073)|
| 2:14:38| I will address one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8078)|
| 2:14:40| When I approached the mayor with this and talked about next year's capital projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| not everything gets funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| We don't know where our financial position is, and the whole world could change tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8088)|
| 2:14:51| I understand the fluid nature of budgets and priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8091)|
| 2:14:55| What I'm simply asking is to get the process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| If it goes in this capital project and we're able to do this and other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| and it moves forward and all of that is approved in next year's fiscal budget, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8102)|
| 2:15:06| If not, we have a great asset that we have more information, we have a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| we have acquisition events, and we have something that could be done down the road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| I don't think it's a lost leader if it moves forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8115)|
| 2:15:18| or if it puts on hold for any number of fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8118)|
| 2:15:22| I didn't look at the line item transfer number on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| What is the line item transfer number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8125)|
| 2:15:27| $200,000, and that essentially covers $100,000 of professional design engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8127)|
| 2:15:33| $95,000 is professional design and engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8133)|
| 2:15:37| That's been based upon a bid that's already been sourced by the engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8137)|
| 2:15:43| and then $100,000 for property right-of-way acquisition easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| and other related items as it comes to where it may lay according to the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8147)|
| 2:15:52| And that, again, is an estimate from engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8152)|
| 2:15:57| Good. Are you good? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| Okay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8159)|
| 2:16:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| Commissioner Jay, I think this is a great project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8165)|
| 2:16:08| and I really am glad to see you out trying to find things in the community to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| I am a little bit like Brad, I believe, concerned about our priorities and our capital budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| This budget's going to be a very tight budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| and I want to make sure that this is, I think, a great project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8182)|
| 2:16:27| but I want to make sure we don't pass up any of our greater needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8187)|
| 2:16:31| One of my big concerns is infrastructure on our roads, our safe intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8191)|
| 2:16:35| our parental zones around our schools to make sure kids have a sidewalk to walk on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8195)|
| 2:16:40| when they're required to go to school, to walk to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8200)|
| 2:16:45| I'm a little concerned about, in the line-item transfer, paying for right-of-way acquisitions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8205)|
| 2:16:54| when we're not sure if we're going to go forward with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8214)|
| 2:17:01| I'm asking Mr. Snowden to come up because it might, I think it's more than just buying acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8221)|
| 2:17:08| But go ahead, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8228)|
| 2:17:10| I also think this falls into one of those projects where you get into the realm of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| is it a capital project that you put in the budget, or is this something that you wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8235)|
| 2:17:20| and you see if you have any fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8240)|
| 2:17:23| and then look at your priorities that you're left with that you weren't able to take care of in your capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| I'd call on Director Caldwell to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| It seems odd to me that the first thing that we're going to put in our 2019-2020 budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8256)|
| 2:17:43| is something that is not a project that we've had in the pipeline for a while and wasn't a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8263)|
| 2:17:51| I want to make sure we don't skip over any of those priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8271)|
| 2:17:55| that this commission has made over the last five, six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8275)|
| 2:18:02| I don't know if that was a question or not, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8282)|
| 2:18:08| I think historically we try to keep our five-year plan the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| There are ebbs and flows to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Talking to Mr. Snowden this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8295)|
| 2:18:17| I don't think he's anticipating a huge increase in his capital requests and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8297)|
| 2:18:22| It's going to remain fairly flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8302)|
| 2:18:26| Actually, maybe you're pulling some things out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| I think that could lead to room for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8310)|
| 2:18:37| We haven't got the schools yet, have we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8317)|
| 2:18:39| We haven't got the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8319)|
| 2:18:41| We have not got schools, but I will tell you that we do have an MOU that the schools are bound to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8321)|
| 2:18:48| in their five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8328)|
| 2:18:50| I'm not saying that's what this mayor is going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8330)|
| 2:18:54| but technically by the MOU that the board and the commission agree to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8334)|
| 2:18:59| it holds that five-year plan the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| What is in the schools' capital plan for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| I think $7.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| $7.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| I believe that's the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8349)|
| 2:19:15| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| Okay, Commissioner Smith, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8358)|
| 2:19:19| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8359)|
| 2:19:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8360)|
| 2:19:21| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| I'll just simply echo what people have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| I want to ask the question if you've approached Legacy Foundation or had a conversation with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| I have had a conversation with them, but I haven't approached them for any formal partnership on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8370)|
| 2:19:34| It's something I would certainly do, but at the end of the day, I think all partners are welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8374)|
| 2:19:41| This is simply a way to get the process off the ground and begin to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| I just feel like this is a critical safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8388)|
| 2:19:50| I know there are a hundred other priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8390)|
| 2:19:52| I know there are other things in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8392)|
| 2:19:54| I think if we never did anything but, you know, priority one, two, and three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8394)|
| 2:19:59| and never focused on anything, we'd be fairly paralyzed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| But we ebb and flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8402)|
| 2:20:03| We look at things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8403)|
| 2:20:04| We go through a budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| We amend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| We try to find ways to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| The most is what we can, and I think, you know, to address both your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| that's part of the budget process where we prioritize what is coming up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8414)|
| 2:20:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8421)|
| 2:20:22| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| Mr. Caldwell, the line item transfer comes out of the BHUCC, which is behavioral health care, $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8426)|
| 2:20:37| Is that money that the state gave us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| So we had set aside $1 million for the construction of that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8440)|
| 2:20:46| and during the process of the behavioral health urgent care center and state funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8446)|
| 2:20:51| they gave us more money for capital than what we had budgeted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| And then they gave us more money for capital than what we had expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| so we had savings in that fund that we had borrowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| And so would it not be wise to keep it there in case we need that money for behavioral health care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| We have spend down requirements, and so we've got to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8471)|
| 2:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8474)|
| 2:21:18| I'm along the lines with Commissioner Smith that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8478)|
| 2:21:22| it may be a great project, but there's things in other areas of the county, fire departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| volunteer fire departments, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| So, you know, I'm hopefully that I'm kind of concerned, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| that we're going to look at putting $1.37 million in a capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8493)|
| 2:21:39| You know, that's a first line item, and I'm just kind of concerned about it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| It's probably a great project safety-wise and everything, but like you say, there's 100 other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8503)|
| 2:21:48| and we'll have to wait and see who gets funded and who doesn't get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8508)|
| 2:21:52| Yeah, certainly I'm not assuming that this is a done deal in the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| That's part of the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| That's part of what the mayor has put forth, part of what the commission has to debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| But much like every other project, it's got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| It's got to start with an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| You've got to start with a way to determine, you know, exact costs and is it feasible and move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8528)|
| 2:22:14| and that's simply what I'm trying to accomplish today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8538)|
| 2:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8539)|
| 2:22:20| Commissioner, are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8540)|
| 2:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8541)|
| 2:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8544)|
| 2:22:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8545)|
| 2:22:26| Commissioner Jay, I was on the legacy board for almost three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8546)|
| 2:22:31| and in that three-year period, it was privately funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8551)|
| 2:22:36| and I think they put in somewhere in the neighborhood of about four or five miles of greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8556)|
| 2:22:43| Is your project going to hook onto any greenway that's already there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8563)|
| 2:22:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8567)|
| 2:22:48| There's an existing greenway that is in the sort of center portion of this project that is in and around the cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8568)|
| 2:22:54| in and around the bike paths of the cove, and then just to the east of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8574)|
| 2:22:58| So there is literally we literally currently have greenways to nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8578)|
| 2:23:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8583)|
| 2:23:04| They stop, and this is a simple, this is an extension on both ends of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8584)|
| 2:23:08| On the Choteau side, you have sidewalks and a greenway right up to Weigels, and it stops and dead ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| Then you have this huge gap until you get to the cove, and then on the other side of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| it goes across the bridge and over and stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8599)|
| 2:23:22| And then this would continue that gap to the next sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8602)|
| 2:23:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8605)|
| 2:23:26| They raise money all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| If you take your project there right now, you know, and the next time that they have their meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| and I forgot what day it was on, but anyway, present that project to them and get them on their agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| you could probably get it completed quicker than the county could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8620)|
| 2:23:43| and they would raise money and they get people to go ahead and fund that from the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8623)|
| 2:23:50| And if you use part of that money, like Mr. Stode said, not all of it, but maybe part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8630)|
| 2:23:58| to put a little seed money in front of the legacy parks, like I said, it may happen a lot quicker than you might want it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8638)|
| 2:24:07| So I would go to them first because they are the experts in putting in bike trails, greenways, and making blueways navigable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8647)|
| 2:24:15| So that's only my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8657)|
| 2:24:18| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| And I just will reiterate that that is that amongst other partners through both legacy parks, engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8659)|
| 2:24:26| parks and rec, and other partners will be approached very quickly to say here's the commitment we've made so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8666)|
| 2:24:33| and here's the plan we're going forward and would you like to be partnered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| I'd love to come back and say this doesn't cost this, it costs this because of this many partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8676)|
| 2:24:40| I'm simply trying to get the first stages of this project off the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8680)|
| 2:24:46| I would say this, this isn't any different than any other idea that any of you commissioners have had in any of your districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8686)|
| 2:24:54| You've had ideas for BMX parks, you've had ideas for polling stations, and Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8694)|
| 2:25:01| everybody has a project that they're trying to help their constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8701)|
| 2:25:06| Commissioner Biggs and I are in a unique position of representing the entire county and all 450,000 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| so it's certainly not meant to substitute from one project to the other or the needs of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8711)|
| 2:25:16| simply a safety aspect that I think we can invest in, mitigate our risk, enhance our quality of life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8716)|
| 2:25:22| and really connect people in a way that I think is effective for really generations to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8728)|
| 2:25:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8729)|
| 2:25:30| While you all can't see her light, Commissioner Carringer's light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| I want to say thank you, Commissioner Jay, for putting all the hard work and going with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8734)|
| 2:25:41| My brother and sister-in-law live not even a half a mile from the big roundabout there on Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8741)|
| 2:25:49| But I do share the same concerns as Commissioner Andrews, Bussler, and Gill, and Smith, and Bussler and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8749)|
| 2:25:57| because as everybody knows, Tazewell Pike, Washington Pike, Millartown Pike, the safety issues are crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8757)|
| 2:26:09| Our traffic, our roads, with building the new Gibbs Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8769)|
| 2:26:15| we are seeing a lot of property owners out Tazewell Pike and Washington Pike sell their properties and build more subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8775)|
| 2:26:25| Well, all of that traffic has to come our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8785)|
| 2:26:30| So I have had this huge concern about Shenandale Road with Shenandale School and coming out on Tazewell Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8790)|
| 2:26:37| and all the school buses turning left to go up Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8797)|
| 2:26:41| So although I believe in this, and so I guess I'm kind of like, okay, if Monday we vote to transfer this and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8801)|
| 2:26:53| we're using that money right now, and I guess I would kind of like to see if you could get Legacy Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8813)|
| 2:27:00| or somebody, some private funding on board to do that because of the issues in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8820)|
| 2:27:10| that we haven't been able to get state funding, city and county all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| to get some things done with our traffic flow and the safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| And as far as running off the roads, I'd say Tazewell Pike, Washington Pike, and all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8841)|
| 2:27:25| they had the same issues of what North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8845)|
| 2:27:28| The accidents are unreal out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8848)|
| 2:27:32| So although, I mean, I love this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8852)|
| 2:27:35| It's great, but I think I have the same concern as to how are we going to be able to make our whole county safer, better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8855)|
| 2:27:48| Well, if I could address that just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8868)|
| 2:27:51| Part of taking this to any project is having a proper design and a proper set of cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| and a real plan for here's exactly where it's going to go and here's what's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| Right now, this is a concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| This is a drawing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8882)|
| 2:28:04| This is a couple of ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| For me, the designer, the engineering department, it's not a formal construction plan, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8885)|
| 2:28:11| that says here's exactly where it's going to go and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8891)|
| 2:28:14| And essentially, in order to take it to further parties, that's the plan I'm looking to create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| so that then we can continue on and find other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8901)|
| 2:28:25| There may be other partners that want to just look at a concept and fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| I haven't found that experience to be the case, but I'm new to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8908)|
| 2:28:32| And when it comes to, yes, Tazewell Pike, Starry Plains, any number of these other things, you're absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8912)|
| 2:28:39| I think today we just approved a Greenway study or we passed on that to vote on a Greenway study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8919)|
| 2:28:46| that has a more comprehensive view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8926)|
| 2:28:48| I hope we continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8928)|
| 2:28:50| But I also hope that we don't say, oh, but wait a second, we've got to have it here but not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8930)|
| 2:28:54| and then we fight over whether it's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8934)|
| 2:28:56| We have to have it everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8936)|
| 2:28:57| Safety is our number one priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| And I think, but for all, you could make that argument the next time somebody brings up a project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8939)|
| 2:29:05| why not my neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8945)|
| 2:29:06| Well, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Give me your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| Let's debate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8948)|
| 2:29:09| Let's figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8949)|
| 2:29:10| Let's convince our mayor and let's vote as a body to invest in lots of different projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8950)|
| 2:29:15| I'm a firm believer in safety across the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| This is just one of many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8958)|
| 2:29:20| I hope we have an opportunity to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8960)|
| 2:29:22| Commissioner Jay, I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8962)|
| 2:29:23| Of this, how much of it was the budget just on right-of-way acquisition on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8963)|
| 2:29:29| It was essentially $100,000 for design and $100,000 allocated for right-of-way easements, acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8969)|
| 2:29:35| Some of that is not necessarily just obtaining property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8975)|
| 2:29:38| Some of it may be, as it goes through here, maybe a property owner gives easement and access to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8978)|
| 2:29:44| but there's a fence and you have to move that fence back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8984)|
| 2:29:47| If I'm saying that correctly, Mr. Snowden, it's more than just buying rights to land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8987)|
| 2:29:51| It's looking at different ways to enhance the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| I guess one question within that total number, how much of that is, it was probably in there, but I've moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=8994)|
| 2:30:01| It's $95,000 for the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9001)|
| 2:30:02| How much is, yeah, so design slash planning is about $95,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9002)|
| 2:30:05| It is $95,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| And the other stuff is that, so I guess I'm just saying one alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9006)|
| 2:30:11| if this body is uncomfortable allocating the funding around acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9011)|
| 2:30:15| maybe something looking around the funding to take a hard look at the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9015)|
| 2:30:21| Yeah, you certainly could approve the design transfer to cover the design to get that part going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9021)|
| 2:30:26| and then leave the second part for future time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9026)|
| 2:30:29| That's certainly, if it's the will of this body, then you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9029)|
| 2:30:32| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9034)|
| 2:30:35| That was going to be my, you made a statement that it was not a construction plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9035)|
| 2:30:39| that if you don't have a construction plan, don't buy anybody's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9039)|
| 2:30:42| Yeah, the design always comes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| Yeah, but you stated earlier that it wasn't a construction plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9044)|
| 2:30:48| Well, if you don't have a plan to build something, don't buy the property yet, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9048)|
| 2:30:52| I just didn't list that in the correct order, but design would always come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| But you don't need the money for a property acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9057)|
| 2:31:00| if you don't have a construction plan to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9060)|
| 2:31:03| And like I said, you said have priorities all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9063)|
| 2:31:06| We have a list of around school priorities that's been around for 12 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9066)|
| 2:31:11| that we're trying to whittle down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9071)|
| 2:31:13| Every year we try to take one or two of those projects off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9073)|
| 2:31:16| and Chaud Road is one of the deadliest short roads in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| and it's taken me 10 years to get it on the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9080)|
| 2:31:25| Those projects are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9085)|
| 2:31:27| Those projects are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| Your project's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| But for a county that's not flush with cash, I mean, that's almost like a well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9091)|
| 2:31:40| It has return on investment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9100)|
| 2:31:42| Because it raises the value of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9102)|
| 2:31:44| It raises the value of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| But we have critical needs, infrastructure needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9106)|
| 2:31:52| We're working on the same plan that Mayor Schumpert put together on capital plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| It's not like we're running ahead of the game with capital plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9117)|
| 2:32:01| We're working on Mayor Schumpert's traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| So, I mean, that's what we've got to think about as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| We're doing projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9129)|
| 2:32:11| Jim Snowden cut the ribbon on a project as the chief engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9131)|
| 2:32:16| where he started the project as an intern in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9136)|
| 2:32:19| Parkside Drive, 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| If we had a, I've been saying it for four or five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9142)|
| 2:32:25| we don't have a road plan in this county that's up to date that keeps up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9145)|
| 2:32:30| we don't keep up infrastructure, anything road-wise in this county at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9150)|
| 2:32:35| And to go over to greenways when you don't have the road structure you need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9155)|
| 2:32:39| it makes it hard to go out and have that discussion with people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9159)|
| 2:32:41| Well, I would argue that this is a bit of a road structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9161)|
| 2:32:44| because you're not going to, as Commissioner Schumacher said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9164)|
| 2:32:47| you're not going to change North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9167)|
| 2:32:49| Oh, I don't disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9169)|
| 2:32:51| I think it's, the project is wonderful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9171)|
| 2:32:54| and I wish we had $12 million a year to spend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9174)|
| 2:32:59| or $1.5 million to spend every year in each district to do a project like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWSR1467190122?start=9179)|
