| 0:02:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of our meeting of July 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=126)|
| 0:02:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Any corrections, additions, deletions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Minutes approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Any items dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=143)|
| 0:02:27| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| I've got three items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=148)|
| 0:02:32| I'd like to postpone 11L and 11M for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=152)|
| 0:02:36| These are the contracts for the Lawn Sale Redevelopment Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| This has been worked on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| I'm postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| They need to be worked on by the legal department a tiny little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| I'm postponing this for a meeting I won't be at because I think these need to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=170)|
| 0:02:54| and I think they're not that controversial because so much citizen work has gone into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=174)|
| 0:02:58| So I'm moving to postpone those for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=178)|
| 0:03:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| That's 11L and 11M for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| Move to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| And then I'd like to postpone 11O until August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| This is the Guns and Park Resolution, and we'd like to – I think we ought to deal with that when everybody is at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=198)|
| 0:03:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Move and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| On that particular issue, Vice Mayor Becker, I'd like to have this council think about having a public forum or a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| A public forum might be most appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| I think we need to allow chance for robust public discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| This is something that folks feel very passionate about on both sides of the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| and it's important for me to hear from those constituencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=230)|
| 0:03:55| I know there's – excuse me, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| No, you go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| Well, I'll just – I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| I know from trying to schedule the Flinnegan discussion that getting all of us around the table before August 25th is a little problematic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=241)|
| 0:04:09| but I hope it can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=249)|
| 0:04:13| Councilman Hulquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| To follow up on that, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| I wonder if – I'm not about to start another task force, but I wonder if it's something that can engage people from both sides of the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=257)|
| 0:04:28| and really let them make their case would be appropriate in that sort of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| Certainly, we've been hearing from people, and I think I've heard some pretty in-depth arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| and I think it would be good to let those folks make their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| I don't know how we go about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| Again, I think Vice Mayor Becker is right in that if we try to do anything before that last meeting in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| we're going to have trouble getting council members there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=292)|
| 0:04:56| And so that could be problematic, and I think we shouldn't take it lightly and we should be very careful how we proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| Anyway, that and also I think it might be appropriate since there are probably people here to ask them to stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| or whatever, you know, for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| Just give them a chance to show that there's interest if there are people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Are you asking that as a request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Yeah, I wouldn't mind if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| The people that are in favor of here that came to speak in favor or to show support for the resolution to ban carry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=323)|
| 0:05:36| licensed carry of handguns in city parks and recreational facilities, people in favor, could you stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=336)|
| 0:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| I don't see anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| The people opposed, could you stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=347)|
| 0:05:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| I just want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| I'm going to go Ms. Pelos-Light next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Well, I just want to comment that I'm personally not in favor of postponement because there is a lot of interest, strong interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=364)|
| 0:06:16| I have spent two days just doing nothing but sitting at my desk and responding to e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=376)|
| 0:06:22| And I appreciate hearing all the comments on the issue from all the people who took the time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| And I just want to comment that if a postponement is approved, I really don't need more e-mails from you if we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=389)|
| 0:06:42| And I have a personal commitment that I respond to every e-mail I receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| So please, you know, spare some of us duplications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| We have good memories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| But I want to say I always regret to postpone something when it's been publicly noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| and people have come out, especially on a bad night like tonight, to be heard and to hear an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| I have a real problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| I just, I feel this Council has gotten too comfortable with postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| and that is something that I'm not comfortable with personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| I would say if we vote to postpone this, there is no reason to vote to postpone it unless we intend to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=442)|
| 0:07:30| And I think if we vote to postpone, then I think it's incumbent on every one of us to commit to a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=450)|
| 0:07:38| and to that opportunity to hear those who want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| And we already have a huge issue at the end of August before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| and I just don't want to cheat either issue, and it concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=466)|
| 0:07:54| So now that I just want you to be clear on how I feel about the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| and thank you so much for the emails, but you don't really need to take your time to speak to me again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| because you've really made some good points with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=488)|
| 0:08:10| I would just concur with Mrs. Pila that I do think the postponement hinges on the opportunity to provide the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| an opportunity to comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| And so I would hope, even if we have to go outside of our regular Thursday calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| that all of us would look for a date when we could attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I plan to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| I'm prepared to move forward with this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| However, you know, our friend Steve Hall is not here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=512)|
| 0:08:37| I know from being friends with Steve for many years, going through campaigns with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| and seeing who some of the guests he has on his show, he will care passionately about this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| So I support that to allow him to come and engage in that debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| And then, unfortunately, the sponsor of the resolution is going to be at a church ceremony,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| You're going to be missing the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| So that's where I think we end up with, you know, approximately August 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=543)|
| 0:09:09| But, you know, I think definitely Steve should be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| and I think the sponsor of this resolution needs to be here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| What's your position on the workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| I'm fine with the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Commissioner Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| Let me just, as far as the workshop goes, we have the August 20th date, and I know I will be back for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| By the way, for people's information, I will be on my honeymoon on the August 11th date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| and will not be missing you at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| So the 20th could work, and I think some of this depends on Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=581)|
| 0:09:47| I'll be, I think, unreachable, so if Mr. Hall can do another 20th, I can say I can as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| And I would suggest we actually do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=593)|
| 0:09:55| I think Steve is back after this week, as I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| Just briefly, I think we need to go ahead and move on with the people's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=598)|
| 0:10:02| We've had a number of issues that we've postponed around our schedules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| and I'm not one that agrees we should do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| And we started down this line, and I think we need to all jointly agree not to do this anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| because some of these issues are very, very important and sensitive and costly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=616)|
| 0:10:21| And so I support a workshop and moving forward with a workshop on the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| and then addressing this on the 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| The Chair's two cents worth is I don't think we should legitimately keep postponing because somebody's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| I just don't think that's a good reason because that's part of the deal being on Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| I do think it's a good reason if you say I need to understand the issue better and I want to hear more sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| I do think that's a legitimate reason, but that's just personal opinion from the Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| The vote then is to, I think, to have a workshop on the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=653)|
| 0:11:00| and to postpone this until the August 25th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Is that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| So, and I would be in favor of postponing the 25th with the explicit understanding there would be a workshop on the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=672)|

| 0:11:16| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| For those who came tonight specifically for that issue, we apologize for dragging you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| I do think, though, this will give the issue a good chance to be heard and researched by everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| I don't think this is a shirking of duty, and I think it's more of a we want to understand the issue better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| So I apologize for everybody coming out in the rain tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| There will be a workshop on the 20th, and that will be posted on the city website relative to time and date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=696)|
| 0:11:42| and time and place of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=702)|

| 0:12:49| Mr. Swanson, in the history on this case, there was an event in May of 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=769)|
| 0:12:59| On the final page of our packet, I assume that that does not affect this permit application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| That does not affect this particular aspect of it to the extent that it affects it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| it will affect it for the ABC board rather than before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=793)|

| 0:13:43| Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| I'll be brief because we have a full agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| The American Quilters were here last Tuesday through Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| Over 10,000 people came to that, by the way, so hopefully you saw their presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| That was a wonderful event for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| And they had already committed to be here this year and in 2010 and 11, and they committed to come back in 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| so that's obviously good news for all of us in the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| And I want to thank the folks at the convention center and Knoxville Tourism and Sports Corp. for their help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=847)|
| 0:14:12| Shakespeare on the Square is taking place on Market Square, Midsummer Night's Dream, on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=852)|

| 0:14:25| An old blanket or lawn chair is all you need to view the free performance, but they would appreciate a $5 donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=865)|
| 0:14:31| And one reminder, Friday and Saturday brings back movies at the Bisou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=871)|

| 0:14:46| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| Well, I thought maybe you might mention it, but we all had so many e-mails today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| But I had an e-mail from the Sports and Tourism Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| And they mentioned that the Boston Globe had a wonderful article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| You may want to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=903)|

| 0:15:05| You go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| It had a wonderful article about Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| And we were highlighted as their number one exciting event and a way to draw a big crowd to your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=907)|
| 0:15:16| And so we have traveled all the way to Boston today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| And congratulations to, I guess, to Mickey, to Hull City for all their good work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=919)|

| 0:16:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| Trying to get a little history here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| I'm sure Mr. Osborne will be a great member of that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=973)|
| 0:16:18| When Mark Brown was serving, I was under the impression representing the city, city council, vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=978)|
| 0:16:26| Actually, the city has two appointees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Two appointees, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| It doesn't have to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| But there was some rationale for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Mark had just expressed an interest to me in doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| So the city's prior representatives were Mark and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=997)|
| 0:16:42| And so then when Mark moved out, he said he no longer wanted to serve there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| And Vice Mayor Becker wasn't interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| Vice Mayor Becker wasn't contacted, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| It hasn't historically been a city council position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| It was just in that case it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Prior to that, it had been a private citizen always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1027)|

| 0:19:02| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| And this doesn't have anything to do with this Public Property Naming Committee, but I had some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| that were opposed to this some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| I don't know if any other council members were contacted on it, but I'd like to get a little background on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| the necessity for this, the rationale, reasoning, and why the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| Thank you, Councilor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| The members of the neighborhood came to the MPC and asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| That segment of Bowling Lane, which is being changed to Forest Hills Boulevard, is separated by a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| from the other portion of Bowling Lane, so those two segments are not connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| And the residents along that segment have been using the street name of Forest Hills Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1183)|
| 0:19:52| That created a Y-shaped street with Forest Hills being used as the name for both legs of that Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| So the easternmost one, which connected up to Village Road, is being changed to Village Road in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1202)|
| 0:20:15| eliminate that duplication at the Y.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| Ultimately, the request from the adjacent property owners of that Village Road segment, or the area south of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1219)|
| 0:20:28| is to abandon the right-of-way and literally eliminate the connection from Forest Hills to Village Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1228)|
| 0:20:41| Is anybody going to have to assume any of that property management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| Ms. White contacted me some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| During this process, was there any sort of a public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| Was there any opposition to it at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| We have signatures from all of the people that are adjacent to the road segments in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| They're in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| And we did have a public meeting in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| I was just going to comment that initially, I had, Councilman Bailey, I had some people who commented they were in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1270)|
| 0:21:19| I have never heard from those individuals again since they had their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| So the assumption I had to make was that there was no opposition because, as the district council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| I have not been contacted by anyone since the initial discussion about it occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1291)|
| 0:21:39| And I think one of the complaints was that this individual I heard from thought that she was going to have to assume the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1299)|
| 0:21:50| that currently the city takes care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| It was going to be, she was afraid to oppose it because of the pressure by her neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1313)|
| 0:22:01| And so that's why I was contacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| And I recall passing that along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| I thought I passed it along to some other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| But if there wouldn't be any opposition to it, I wouldn't mind just to postpone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1331)|
| 0:22:18| and let me do a little checking and get back with the council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| Would that be okay, Councilman Pelo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| Would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I see no point in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| And you know how I feel about postponements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| But if you feel that would be helpful, it would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| It's just simply that there's been many opportunities to hear from her again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| I was aware of her concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| I assumed that they had been responded to because she never asked me again for assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| or expressed to me her opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| Is there a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| There is a motion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| I'd like to make the motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Who precedes those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| A motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Discussion on the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Anybody else want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| These lights I'm taking are on something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1395)|

| 0:26:13| I think I need a little bit help about this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Mr. Reynolds, I think probably could help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Maybe I need help about the translation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| I understand, just I don't understand in the full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| I understand partial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Oh, your son can help you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1589)|
| 0:26:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| I don't want to do any more, any addition, just what I have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| What's your opinion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| I think the higher the structure is, the greater the setback has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| You're wanting to build something that is atypically high, and to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| you have to have a further setback from the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So to get what you're asking for, sir, you're having to ask for a setback variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1620)|
| 0:27:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1634)|
| 0:27:15| No, I just feel strongly that Mr. Reynolds can be very helpful in clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Tom, would you like to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| It is a confusing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1640)|
| 0:27:22| We're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| Tom, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Would you like to add something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Mr. Kochen applied for a building permit to do a one-story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| do in addition to a one-story single-family residence in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1650)|
| 0:27:38| The inspector at the time, who is no longer with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| and the plans examiner at the time, who is no longer with the city, approved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| From the standpoint of they did a, I mean, the plans review approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| When the building inspector went out for the first inspection, footer inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| according to city records, he did a partial inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| He was called again to do a framing inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| Our records indicate that he did, that he was not ready for that framing inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| We think at that time that the inspector notified Mr. Kochen that he had built something more than one story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| and that he could possibly be in violation of the side yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| This continued on for some time until the building permit was expired by the original building inspector on 2-11-05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1710)|
| 0:28:45| It was reopened and approved to be reopened in 3-17-05| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1725)|
| 0:28:54| that Mr. Kochen would seek a waiver to get a variance for the height that he had already built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1734)|
| 0:29:04| There was no progress on the building permit, so that permit was expired in 11-18-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1744)|
| 0:29:18| Then Mr. Kochen requested a permit to continue what he had been doing in the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1758)|
| 0:29:26| with the understanding that he would still continue to seek a variance for that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| That permit was opened 12-31-08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1774)|
| 0:29:40| And subsequently to that opening of that permit, Mr. Kochen has seeked to remedy the situation of the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| Some things that have transpired during that time, Mr. Kochen had hired a surveyor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| and I think had some disagreement with his surveyor as to what the setback actually was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1796)|
| 0:30:02| Mr. Kochen would need 12 feet since he had went more than one story for the single family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1802)|
| 0:30:12| I think that at that time, and Mr. Kochen, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| he may have hired another surveyor to do another survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And in the meantime, he appealed to BZA to get the variance that he needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| It had been before BZA four different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| Each time the neighborhood had shown up in opposition, there was quite a discussion about it, about the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1837)|
| 0:30:49| One time Mr. Kochen had to postpone, I think for some reason, I'm not sure what that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| but the board did willingly postpone the issue until the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| when the Board of Zoning Appeals disapproved his request for the variance setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1859)|
| 0:31:08| upon which time Mr. Kochen appealed to council to overturn that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| And that is how we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| Do you have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| I see some lights, but any questions for Tom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Go ahead then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Mr. Reynolds, when was you said we had a first, and it wasn't actually a notice of violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| but a first official thing in the file that said, Mr. Kochen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| you have a permit to build a one-story house and you're building a two-story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1897)|
| 0:31:42| I think I heard something like 05 in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| I wanted to check on when that first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| and then I want to ask Mr. Kochen when he thinks it was as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| But what do you show in the file as the first time he was told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| you're only allowed to have one story here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1917)|
| 0:32:10| Mr. Jenkins, who was the inspector, I think that was 3-23-04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Now, Mr. Kochen, let me ask you, and I know there's some language issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| I know you grew up in a different country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| But when was the first time you heard from the city saying you were only allowed to build a one-story house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| not a two-story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| In 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I'm asking first time for permit for build one-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| And did you ever ask the city for a permit to build a two-story house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| Honestly, I don't try to excuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| Everything I can prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| I have a lot of people from different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| They're coming from Michigan from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| They're coming from Atlanta from the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| The reason why I do this, I know I'm guilty about this point because I build for what I'm not asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1987)|
| 0:33:17| I'm asking for one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| Just I have a little discuss between to me and my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| When I'm asking for one story, I say, I like to be in my son room for first level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2004)|
| 0:33:35| She say, I like to be here, my living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| After this, I have some people who coming to help me for Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| And I build my son room in the top, the living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2025)|
| 0:33:52| For this, I don't ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| Just I have a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| They are coming, ask, is help me, is build this room, son room, and they put the roof over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| And I'm looking to ask for permit after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| And Miss Debra, Debra I think from fifth floor from permit, she tell me, you have to go to home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2047)|
| 0:34:16| You have to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| You have to check the very near corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Have to have 12 foot from the corner, from the very near corner to property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2062)|
| 0:34:30| In 2001, I repeat what I tell them couple week ago, couple week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| I do survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| Just they don't, the server who make my, who do the job from survey, he never show me the back side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2078)|
| 0:34:52| And now in the May in 2009, I have other survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| I'm paid for this other money like $450.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| And I find out I have 11 feet from the very near corner to property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2104)|
| 0:35:15| After this, I'm apply for variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| It's coming lot of problem discussed in four or five months, much pressure, much stress, much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2117)|
| 0:35:26| Let me, but again, you knew when you put that second floor above the, I guess it's the one your wife wanted for a living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2126)|
| 0:35:34| When you put the second, the son room on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Yes, Tony by Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| This is a very, very separately still, it's actually still tied in the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2137)|
| 0:35:46| Just it's under different roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| Let me ask you one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| When did you stop work on the second floor of your house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| When, when, when did you, when did you stop doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Because obviously it's still under construction and it's been sitting for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2161)|
| 0:36:08| I'm very honestly, I, sometime I need a little bit help because make me for can understand very well, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2168)|
| 0:36:16| Can you, can you, can you have a, I guess the question is you were building the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| I knew it was a problem and the city came and said, you've got to apply for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| Did you stop working on it then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| Oh no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I don't work there for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| I don't work on this side for a very long time, for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Signed up to speak against is Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| I'm Dan Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I live 22 Wallwood, which is two doors down from Mr. Kocan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| And I was here the last time and presented a petition that had been passed around the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| And I think everybody should have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| I think there were some 30-some names that had signed up in opposition to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2235)|
| 0:37:23| I think 16 or 17 houses on Wallwood or across the street right into Wallwood, which is Ridgefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| had signed up in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| And, you know, I don't want to repeat everything that I said two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| but the opposition in the neighborhood is that the top story, which I guess by the engineering standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2257)|
| 0:37:47| it may be the second story with dormers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| In looking at it, it looks like a third story to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| It is the top story that is, you know, what we are opposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| It is out of character with the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| Nobody else has a story or an addition on their house of that height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| And it is disconcerting to me as well as to some of the other neighbors on our side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2288)|
| 0:38:16| in that he can see up and down the street, see into everybody's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| It's not like he has a mountain view or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| All he can see is his neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| And so we are opposed to the top story of the addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2306)|
| 0:38:34| If he would remove the top story of the addition, whether he still has two stories or just one story after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2314)|
| 0:38:41| if he would just remove the top story, we would not be opposed to a variance if he still needed one for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| But we would like the top story to be taken down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| Mr. Kidd, I want to be clear on what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| And I spoke to you, I guess, on Sunday and did not realize this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| What you just said is what we object to is what you're calling a third story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| which is sort of what sticks out over the top of his roof line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| You don't object to the part that is technically a second story that's behind the bulk of his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2349)|
| 0:39:16| Am I correct in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| And I guess it depends on, you know, what is counted as a first story or a second story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2359)|
| 0:39:24| because I've heard the engineering department say that it's basically just two stories with dormers on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| But it's that uppermost story that is the problem, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| And if you were to remove that and so that the roof line on the addition of the house is the same height as the rest of his house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| that would be more in character with the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| That's what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Sir, I recall hearing you speak at the BVA hearing and then, of course, again two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2393)|
| 0:39:59| And I think that not just the height is an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| I believe that that cupola or third floor has some design characteristics which have been a problem for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2404)|
| 0:40:16| Well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| He's got picture windows on both sides of this uppermost story and windows in the front and the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2417)|
| 0:40:27| And I know the engineering department has said, you know, it's not big enough for a living area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2427)|
| 0:40:34| or it mainly could be used only for storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| But, you know, you don't put picture windows in your attic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| And, you know, he calls it a sunroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| So it's, you know, that's what we're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| I have an in-ground swimming pool two doors down, and he can see into my pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| And I could not build a privacy fence tall enough to prevent that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2454)|
| 0:41:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| I just thought that was an important bit of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| And my understanding is the outside of the house, of course, is not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| It's got a roof and windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| The inside, to my understanding, is not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| I don't know where he's at on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Yes, just another question on Mr. Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| As you understand, as I understand this, and I'll make sure you do, what we have is this just question on the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2479)|
| 0:41:27| You know, is he allowed to have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| So to get what you want, we actually should not take action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| And this is something that Mr. Koch, and I hope you're listening, this is something that what you want to come out of this is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2495)|
| 0:41:44| I think, and Mr. Swanson checked me on this, is if we vote either way on this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2504)|
| 0:41:49| what you all are willing to settle with can't happen because he would have to take down the second floor of his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| So it sounds like what should happen on this is a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| allow Mr. Kochen to make the modifications that would satisfy the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2519)|
| 0:42:04| and then come back to I guess would actually end up approving the variance if you all are okay with the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2524)|
| 0:42:10| Am I correct on how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Well, we had, as I said, we had presented this petition two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and I think we put it in the petition as to what we were suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| It is a compromise that we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2540)|
| 0:42:24| It's a compromise that he would not have to remove as much of this structure as he would if this body just outright denies his variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| And we have not heard from him if he's willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2552)|
| 0:42:38| If he's willing to do that, we would be happy to give him a chance to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| because I know that it takes a while if this body denies his variance and there has to be court action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2562)|
| 0:42:50| It could still be years before anything is done to satisfy the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2570)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| I have a question for Mr. Kochen, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| As you come up, I was out of town this past weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| and I was reading all this information again and all the transcripts from the Board of Zoning Appeals, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| In the two weeks' time since this was first brought up, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| have you not had the opportunity to talk with Mr. Kidd, for example, to see what the issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2597)|
| 0:43:26| to see if there is a way that a partial removal of the structure will satisfy everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2606)|
| 0:43:36| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| Just I need a little bit of help, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| My son needs to explain to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| After this, I'll try to give you an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| Mr. President, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| Could you please explain to me what the intentions are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2628)|
| 0:43:52| and if there is a way to satisfy everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| I understand Mr. Rob Frost, yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| I'd like to respond to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| I don't have any ambition like…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2651)|
| 0:44:30| He doesn't want to work like a horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2670)|
| 0:44:34| Ambition like a horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| First, I do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| I know exactly for what Mr. Daniel Kidd complained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| This is the roof that covers all the floor, like the sunroom and the living room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2686)|
| 0:44:56| I don't can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| First reason for why I don't can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| For first time, when I have Mr. Jenkins, the inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| He moved from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| Jenkins, like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| I don't can pronounce very well his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| He lived from Knox area to Linear City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| Mr. Tom Reynolds, he come with other three people from the board to inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2724)|
| 0:45:34| He's verified everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| They find I don't do any violation about the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| When Mr. Tom is coming there, he say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| if you are over 35 feet high from the ground to reach, you are in the big trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2746)|
| 0:45:53| They verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| They check everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| They say, wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| No problem about the code violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| I like, honestly, I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| I'm not false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I'm not false.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| I like to give proof for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I don't like to have dispute with the neighbor because I have five, six, seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| five or six meeting from BZA for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| And I have proof for everything here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| I think, I think better way to verify this to can take conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2784)|
| 0:46:33| Mr. Bob Baker was there Saturday, last Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| He verified everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| You don't can see nothing in the yard for Mr. Daniel Kidd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| He's far, like around the 300 feet to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| You don't can see nothing there on him property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| I have proof, picture, if you like to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Because I'm not looking to argue or shake or like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2819)|

| 0:47:24| Who know about this story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| They ask me some situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| I refuse to discuss with the very close neighbor and the large size neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| They sign for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| I have Tory signature because Mr. Daniel Kidd last couple, last couple week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| He say I have Tory signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2865)|

| 0:47:50| From two, three weeks ago from the date from the seven, from the seven to 7709.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2870)|
| 0:47:58| And the seven, I can give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2878)|

| 0:48:03| I have picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2883)|

| 0:48:08| Mr. Tom Reynolds check is not violation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| Mr. Roberts check, he say we don't can see nothing in the pool or in the yard, the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| Mr. Kokin, maybe while your son brings the petition, pictures for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| Are those the same pictures you handed out to Mr. Kidd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| No, different picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Let me get back to the question I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| Because we have in front of us tonight the issue of a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| And there's certain legal standards that have to be met in determining whether or not to grant a variance, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2913)|
| 0:48:40| The question I asked you didn't pertain to what may or may not have happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2920)|
| 0:48:46| The question was, have you been not able to meet with your neighbors, such as Mr. Kidd, in the past two weeks, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2926)|
| 0:48:56| to discuss a possible amicable resolution to this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| That was the, that was what I was trying to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| Are you, are you, can you meet with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2943)|
| 0:49:09| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| And I try to respond now exactly to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Honestly, I don't contact him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| Because in the last period of time, we don't have a directly personal trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2957)|
| 0:49:25| I just, I'm staying, I have a lot of problem, pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| I stay in my area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I stay in my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| I'm keep my problem because I have a lot of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| Every day, Mr. Steve Talkie was today there, inspector from generic floor or fourth floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| He verified my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| He's verified everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| I have a lot of pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| This is not excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| I'm not talking with Mr. Daniel maybe over, maybe over a month, month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Are you willing to sit down and talk with your neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| I'm ready any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| Any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Have you, do you, tonight, do you understand which portion of your structure that they have issues with, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3003)|
| 0:50:15| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| I understand very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Now, are you willing to listen to them discuss some possible potential removal of part of that structure, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3020)|
| 0:50:29| Sir, it's hard for me to tell them this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3029)|
| 0:50:35| Absolutely, I don't agree with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| Last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| But are you willing to sit down and talk with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| The last meeting, BZA, they approve me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| After that, they disapprove me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| And I don't really like that because I don't do any violation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| I'm looking to see if I work harder for several years, from 2001, now to go to take my roof over the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3054)|
| 0:51:03| This is something very hard because I have a large size family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| Again, I can't prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| It's coming from Michigan, from church, from Pentecostal church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| It's coming from Atlanta to help me now to take the roof down, not for other reason, for ambition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3073)|
| 0:51:21| If you could, and I understand how passionate and personal you feel about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| but if you can answer Mr. Frost's, I think he's asking one specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3085)|
| 0:51:31| Are you willing to sit down and talk to them and involve a discussion that might include removal of the roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| Let me ask this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Are you willing to entertain the discussion of removal of part of your structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| I mean, in the past two weeks, I went out and I have to compliment you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| You have a very nice house, but I also can see from the street the issues that the neighbors have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3108)|
| 0:51:55| Are you willing to – would a meeting be fruitful, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Sir, I feel very bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| I don't like to – honestly, I don't like to speaking like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| Not for bad, please help me or this or compassion me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| I have a large size family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3133)|
| 0:52:15| I work in Romania hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| I work here in the United States hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| Before for BSEC in 2005, I worked for Joseph Construction Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3140)|
| 0:52:26| Sir, I don't – but he's really asked you one specific question and you need to answer that if you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3146)|
| 0:52:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3155)|
| 0:52:42| I'm looking for a yes or no answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Honestly, again, I say no ambition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| I'm in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| BSEC approve me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| After problem, scandal, they disapprove me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3171)|
| 0:52:54| They send me here to the councilor meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| I don't can do this because I'm not violation code for structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| I have picture here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| I have two letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| I have 40 signature for all neighbor, neighbor who I live there for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| I don't can do take roof down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| But this body has to make a decision about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| and I think what Mr. Paulson is trying to do is to see if he can figure out a way to help and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| are you willing to sit down to discuss the possibilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3204)|
| 0:53:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3205)|
| 0:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Are you – well, let me ask this as a follow-up question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| which also hopefully can be answered shortly in a yes or no response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3211)|
| 0:53:39| Are you dead set against potentially removing part of your structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3219)|
| 0:53:47| I mean, you agreed to a meeting, but if you are strong and steadfast in your way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3227)|
| 0:53:53| which is your right, you know, let us know if there's any reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3233)|
| 0:54:01| I don't agree to move this because I don't do for move this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| If possible, I know I do this when they don't have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| I'm guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| He said he's guilty with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Not the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| But not for the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| He didn't do any violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| To code, but for code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3267)|
| 0:54:30| Well, I guess at this point I think the questions have been answered that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| I'll defer to the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3280)|
| 0:54:41| I saw some other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3282)|
| 0:54:43| This question is for Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| And like other council members, I've been by this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| And I'm wondering, last time Mr. Kochen passed around some photographs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| showing the rafters and the inside of the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| and I've not been inside his home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| And perhaps you have in the process of this inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| I'm trying to understand if this superstructure, this cupola,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| has a floor where you can stand in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| or is it just sort of like a giant skylight in terms of it being, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3307)|
| 0:55:12| sometimes you have on top of a house a structure with windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and it just allows light down onto a lower story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I hear Mr. Kidd's concern that one could stand, you know, up in this cupola| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3318)|
| 0:55:24| and look out all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3324)|
| 0:55:26| Is it living space, or does it have a floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3326)|
| 0:55:29| or is it just sort of like a place to let sun into the interior of the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| I have not been in the space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| but the inspectors tell me that it does have a floor in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| I'm going to go to Councilman Hawkins next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| I conferred with Mr. Swanson, who conferred with Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| And it appears that one thing on one option before this council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| is to approve a variance from 12 feet to 10 feet conditioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| on only two stories for the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| In other words, removal of any portion of the structure that's higher than two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| So I don't know if that's the way council would want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| but that does appear to be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| Well, I guess, Mr. Rolfowitz, that's a good thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| I had not thought about that as a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| And, Mr. Kochan, a lot of this comes down to what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| Now, when I talked to you on Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| we had that old discussion about you built the second floor and the third floor without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| You built without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| It's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| Some people call them two, two and a half, three, or whatever what they call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| Having been in there, I mean, there's a third floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| There's the floor above which you're going to use as a sunroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| Now, here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| We have two options, and I think Mr. Holquist made it real clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| We can either tell you to tear down all of the third floor and the second floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| or we can ask you only to tear down the third floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| Now, I think there's a question of would you rather have to tear down more or less of the house you've built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3422)|
| 0:57:14| I would like to ask, because you, Mr. Budbecker, you was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| I have a picture I do from 40 feet high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| You can see absolutely nothing in Mr. Daniel Kidd's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| I do four different positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| You don't see nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| The code, Mr. Tom Reynolds says, is not a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Maybe what I can do, I don't can turn down the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| To close the window from dormer on the side, if the Mr. Daniel, you know, to blend, to put ply, to put siding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3463)|
| 0:57:56| I'm sorry, to stop, to don't keep the, if his thing just can verify please so much, verify this picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3476)|
| 0:58:05| verify this signature for the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| If they like to do this, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| Just I don't see a reason for what to blend my desk because it's very small room there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3490)|
| 0:58:15| It's not much lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| I do four lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Mr. Kocan, the problem you've got is we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3498)|
| 0:58:23| Mr. Kocan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Mr. Kocan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| Yes, Mr. Kocan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Problem, we have laws on how high people can build houses in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| And this is a classic case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3516)|
| 0:58:37| The way we do this is say if you have so much space, you can go so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| You don't have that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| You're only allowed to have a one-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| It doesn't matter whether it has windows or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Now, your neighbors are willing to say they're not going to make you tear down the second floor, only the third floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3528)|
| 0:58:55| And that's kind of your choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3535)|
| 0:59:00| Mr. Becker, if I take the roof down, everything is destroyed, the rain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| because this is cover the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| It's only half story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3550)|
| 0:59:12| What I can do better way, I think, to blend the side where is the picture window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3552)|
| 0:59:20| If you was there, you don't can see nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| It doesn't matter what you see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| It's a matter of how your house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| And, again, keep in mind, the second and third floor you built without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| Mr. Thomas said, I don't do violation for the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| I'm under 35 feet from the ground to reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| I'm a worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| I don't like to argue, argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| I know what I do because I'm 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| I work 29 years from 49 only construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| I work hard to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| Because we have some discuss between to the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Councilman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Councilman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| I would like several references have been made to Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| I would like for Mr. Reynolds to respond, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3607)|
| 1:00:08| What Mr. Kochen is a violation of is a side yard setback because he built more than one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3608)|
| 1:00:15| He's not in violation of height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| He's in violation of side yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| That's the reason he got a survey to establish exactly what that side yard setback was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3619)|
| 1:00:29| May I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| At the BZA hearing, and I believe, and I'm confused now as to whether I heard it at BZA or heard it two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| there was a woman who is a neighbor adjacent to Mr. Kochen's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3640)|
| 1:00:47| and she had an issue with runoff as a result of the distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| Can you comment on that, Mr. Reynolds, and remind me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Because I think that was an issue in my mind, and I don't know why she isn't here tonight to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I think what happened was during the time that Mr. Kochen was trying to establish his side yard property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3666)|
| 1:01:15| he hired a machine, a dozer I assume, to clear some of the land so that he could establish that property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3675)|
| 1:01:26| And in so doing, it created a lot of loose soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| and then I think there was a storm that washed that loose soil onto the neighbor's property behind him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3692)|
| 1:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| I wasn't sure where that figured in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3702)|
| 1:01:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| I wanted to ask Dan a question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3708)|
| 1:01:52| And, Dan, I guess you're speaking on behalf of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| Well, I guess tonight I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| Is the real problem the windows, the vantage point from up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| And it's not so much that you don't want him to bring the roof down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| It's what's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| From my perspective, yes, it is the windows because, like I said, I feel like we're being spied on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3731)|
| 1:02:18| or we don't know if we're being spied on, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| But for the people who signed the petition, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| I can't speak for them that taking them, removing the dormers would satisfy them because, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| it's this top story that is out of character with the rest of the neighborhood because it sticks up higher than even, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3753)|
| 1:02:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| I mean, he could have a two-story in the back, and it still would not be higher than the front part of his house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| I guess the question would be, would the council support the variance if the neighbors dropped their opposition to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3770)|
| 1:03:00| Well, what I think has to happen is we need to postpone this for a council meeting or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| and then we need to get Mr. Koken and try to bridge this communication gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3785)|
| 1:03:13| and explain to him that either he fixes the window problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| or he's going to have to tear down a bunch of his house, and it's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| So I would recommend we have a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| The fifth district councilman is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| He's always able and willing to go out and try to negotiate something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| but I think we just have a communication problem, and he's a hard worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| He understands these things, and if he can get the message clear, I think he would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| So I think that's what we should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| I'd make the motion to postpone for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| Okay, that will take you to that August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| Well, hopefully we can come to some agreement and then he can fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| It could be a heavy meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| And then after it's fixed and the neighborhood is satisfied, we'll come back and vote on the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| The motion on the floor is to postpone it for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Before that's seconded, that takes it to August 25th, where we have some already huge issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3845)|
| 1:04:12| Well, hopefully it's either worked out or it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| Either he does it or you'll vote on the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| It's as simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| We're going to give him one month to do what he needs to do, and if he doesn't do it, you vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Boom, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| Boom, I wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3863)|
| 1:04:27| I'll be prepared to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3870)|
| 1:04:33| Let's make it six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3873)|
| 1:04:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| The motion is now six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3877)|
| 1:04:39| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| Okay, there's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| I'm doubtful that it will help, but I've sat up here before and been convinced postponements wouldn't do any good, and they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| So I'm willing to support it, and I think, Mr. Bailey, you could be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3893)|
| 1:04:59| There could be a communication issue that Mr. Kocan needs to realize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| He has two options that involve changing his house, and he can choose whether he wants to change it a lot or a little, and that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3902)|
| 1:05:12| So I will support the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Counselor Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3915)|
| 1:05:16| Assuming this passes, Mr. Kidd, Mr. Kocan, when you all leave here tonight, if you do not know them already, please exchange telephone numbers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3916)|
| 1:05:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3928)|
| 1:05:29| Any other thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3929)|
| 1:05:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| The motion on the floor is to postpone for six weeks, which I think will take us to September 8th, if I'm doing my math right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| Ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| 10B is an appeal by Jamie Rowe of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve a use-on-review for an attached residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3949)|
| 1:05:57| subject to conditions in an RP1 planned residential district property located on the southeast side of Tazewell Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3957)|
| 1:06:05| southwest of Anderson Road, in conjunction with 11Q, which is a resolution approving the appeal by Jamie Rowe, that's 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3965)|
| 1:06:19| Before we go to any discussion, Mr. Swanson would like to make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| I just want to make sure the Council understands what the issue is in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3984)|
| 1:06:31| The issue in this case is this is a parcel of property that is zoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3991)|
| 1:06:37| It's a planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| And in a planned residential zone, before building permits can be issued for building in a planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=3999)|
| 1:06:49| there has to be a development plan that is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| And so what you have before you tonight is the development plan that has been proposed by the developer of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4012)|
| 1:07:00| And it has been submitted to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| It was approved at the Metropolitan Planning Commission, subject to nine conditions at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4025)|
| 1:07:14| And it has been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| That approval by the Metropolitan Planning Commission has been appealed to you here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| And that's the subject that's before you, whether or not to either agree with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| that the development plan meets the requirements for a development plan for RP1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| or to determine that it does not meet the requirements for a development plan under RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4053)|
| 1:07:39| And this is you acting in your administrative quasi-judicial capacity rather than in your legislative capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| which means you have to adhere to the requirements that are set out in the code with regard to development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| And so you'll know what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| Let me read for you what the requirements are with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| First of all, referring to Article 4, Section 4A, Subsection G of the zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4082)|
| 1:08:12| it provides that for an administrative procedure for a planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4092)|
| 1:08:17| And Subsection 2 provides there that no building permit shall be issued for a development of any property within an R1 district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4097)|
| 1:08:25| as this property is, until a written development plan has been filed with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| Then over in Subsection C, it says the Planning Commission shall renew the proposed development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4111)|
| 1:08:38| and may give approval, request modification, or reject the proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Because this is an appeal, you are sitting in lieu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| Everything it says about the Planning Commission will apply to City Council tonight because you're on appeal here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| So it says then in the subsections below that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| the Planning Commission shall review the conformity of proposed development, recognizing principles of civic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| land use planning, and landscape architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| Subsection B, the Planning Commission may impose conditions regarding layout, circulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4148)|
| 1:09:13| and performance of the proposed development and may require that appropriate deed restriction be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| You will recall that already in this development, I think the MPC has required nine conditions to be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4159)|
| 1:09:26| Subsection C, the tractor parcel of land involved must be in one ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| or the subject of an application filed jointly by the owners of all the property included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| D, the proposed development must be designed to produce an environment of stable and desirable character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4175)|
| 1:09:41| not out of harmony with its surrounding neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| must provide standards of open space and areas for parking adequate for the occupancy proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| It must include provisions for recreation areas to meet the needs of the anticipated population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4190)|
| 1:09:56| Subsection D provides that no building permit shall be issued until a development plan is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4196)|
| 1:10:03| Then moving over to Article 7, Subsection 4, I'm sorry, Subsection 5 of the Zoning Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4203)|
| 1:10:13| it talks specifically about development plans in RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| And it provides a procedure for considering development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| and uses on review within districts requiring design-regulated plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4221)|
| 1:10:26| which is a district like the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And it goes on to say in Subsection A that in RP1, such as this, planned residential districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| the Planning Commission, and now you on appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| shall review plans to determine the compatibility of the plan development with the surrounding area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| and to determine whether the objectives of the zone are met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| With regard to whether you approve or deny this development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| over in Subsection B4, it provides the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| The Planning Commission, or in this case now City Council, may approve a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| or use permitted on review where it can be shown that the proposed plan or use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4266)|
| 1:11:10| and with the general plan and one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| and is reasonably necessary for the convenience and welfare of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| The Planning Commission may deny a development plan or use permitted on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| where the above cannot be shown and where it can be shown that approval would have an adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| on the character of the neighborhood in which the site is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Whereas a use may be appropriate in one location and inappropriate in another location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| in the same zoning district, the Planning Commission, and now you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| shall be guided by the policies of the general plan and by the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4301)|
| 1:11:45| and the exercise of its administrative judgment about the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| and appropriateness of uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| So those are the guidelines that are provided in the code for this administrative procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| and that is the subject of what you're considering tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| and it does not go beyond the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| Anybody have any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| Mr. Faustus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| For clarification, the development plan has to meet the criteria for granting a use on review as well, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| Any other questions for Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| Okay, we do have some people signed up to speak in favor and against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Signed up to speak in favor, I'll go ahead and call all three of them in the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| Charles Taylor, then Jim Bletner, then Charlotte Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| and then we'll have the speakers against after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| So if you'll come up in that order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| Thank you, Mayor, members of the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| I am Charles Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| I live at 4801 Tazewell Pike in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| just a few hundred feet from the development that's at issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| I'm also an attorney, and I'm here not only representing my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| but also a number of my neighbors who, if I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| I would like to stand so that they can be recognized and you can see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| In addition, we have previously submitted to the Council a packet of materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4391)|
| 1:13:16| which I hope all of you have had time to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| I think a packet has also been submitted to the city recorder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| and I would respectfully ask that that packet be made a part of the record tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| My neighbors and I are here tonight, ladies and gentlemen, to save our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4411)|
| 1:13:37| And the reason we want to save our neighborhood is because it's a very special place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| Our neighborhood is very historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| It's one of the older parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| It's a rural part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| Most of the lots in our neighborhood are at least one acre in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| Many of the homes in our neighborhood are over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Some even go back to the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| We're still out in the rural area of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| We still have wildlife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| We have deer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| We have turkey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| We have songbirds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| It's a place that we all love and enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Unfortunately, in recent years, our neighborhood has come under attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| It's come under attack from people who want to make money at our expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| who want to change the character of our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| to change it from single family, large lots, to high-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| And that's why we're here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| because the development that we are trying to prevent from expanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| and make sure that you understand the development's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| There are already condominiums there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| It's the fact that they want to expand that we're opposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| And the reason that we're opposing it is because this development does not meet the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| and standards that the city of Knoxville has established for developments such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| I'm very pleased that your attorney has emphasized that that is the reason you're here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| to decide whether or not it meets those standards, standards such as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| is it compatible with the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Does it cause an adverse effect upon the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| Does it unnecessarily increase traffic through the neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| Those are the reasons that you are here tonight deciding whether this is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| And the reason I say that, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| is because I have seen the packet that the developer submitted to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| And I've read what he says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| And I'm sure that Mr. Seymour, when he gets up in a minute, is going to repeat that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| And he's going to argue to you, you shouldn't judge whether or not my development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| or our development has met the regulations or standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| What you should judge tonight is whether or not we spent a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4540)|
| 1:15:44| That is the standard he wants you to adopt tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| Whether or not his client has a vested interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| has spent so much money already on this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| that you should allow him to go forward and expand it more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| What I don't think Mr. Seymour will tell you tonight is that a lot of that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| that the developer has spent is on attempts to get around the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| and standards that you've established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| And I also don't think he will tell you that much of that money that the developer has spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4568)|
| 1:16:13| has been in paying fines that have been levied against him because he disobeyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4573)|
| 1:16:17| and violated the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| I wish I had time to go through in detail all of the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| and standards that are applicable tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| But I would hope that you have looked at the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| I hope you've looked especially at the reports from the engineer, Dr. Smoot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| who in his reports in there say that because of the sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4592)|
| 1:16:36| and the flooding problems in this area, this neighborhood is only suitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4596)|
| 1:16:41| for single-family residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| It's not suitable for high-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| I hope you'll look at the reports from the many residents of our neighborhood who have wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| There's still a lot of people out there who have wells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| and some of them have already started suffering adverse effects to their wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| because of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| I hope you'll look at the report about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| This development is almost directly across Tazewell Pike from the Shannondale Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4622)|
| 1:17:07| that goes into Shannondale Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| It's on a blind hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| Cars coming across that hill have very little time to react to vehicles coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4630)|
| 1:17:16| This is not an appropriate neighborhood for this type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| There are places where high-density developments such as this are appropriate in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| but this is not one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| We're hoping that, as your attorney said, when you consider your administrative duties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| and review all of the regulations and standards applicable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| you will find that this is not an appropriate development for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| And we respectfully ask that you overturn the Planning Commission and deny the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Mr. Blattner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| Jim Blattner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| I'm speaking on behalf of the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4681)|
| 1:18:03| As most of you know, the Bearden Council is formed of many neighborhood representatives from that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| business representatives from that area, and developers who develop in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| And we have worked with over 150 developers to try to improve our area and have good development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| We are very much so in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| You may wonder why we're here tonight to talk about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| Well, we've watched it very closely at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| and we understand how the development process has been circumvented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4710)|
| 1:18:36| And as we see it, if the process is bad in one part of town, it can be bad in all parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4716)|
| 1:18:44| We do think it has particular implications for us besides those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4724)|
| 1:18:52| We think it has tax implications for all of Knoxville taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| The project puts additional pressure on First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4736)|
| 1:19:00| Flooding along First Creek is legendary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| As a large amount of tax dollars has been paid to study the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| and to fund the buyouts and the improvements, we think this could certainly make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| For that question, I think the experts have said so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| Why should a project be allowed to go forward if it threatens to cause more flooding downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| and cost more money, all of us more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| Why would taxpayers be asked to, in effect, subsidize this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| by paying to fix the problems it causes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4773)|
| 1:19:37| As you know, there's been a lot of time spent on the Ridge Top Development Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| the Sustainable Development Groups, and I'm a member of the County Transfer Development Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4783)|
| 1:19:53| This looks to me to be a perfect example of why we have these committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| This is a project that has not been done properly in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| It's a project that could cause problems in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| And in all probability, it's a project that would be a good one to transfer those development rights to another area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| if we had them, which would be more suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| And Ms. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| I'm Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| I resign at 104 Crawford Road in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| I'm not here to represent a group or an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| I'm just here as a concerned citizen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| concerned that developments are approved that should never be approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| especially in the county where there is lax enforcement of codes and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| Joshua's Landing is a development that should never have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| It was a swamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| There were and still are sinkholes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| As a result of filling in of these sinkholes, well water has been contaminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| Water is free-flowing in a field south of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4869)|
| 1:21:16| because since the sinkholes were filled in, the water has to go somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| You have the opportunity tonight to stop further development on this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4882)|
| 1:21:28| that should never have been developed in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| And that's what I'm asking you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4894)|
| 1:21:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4895)|
| 1:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| Those speaking against Mr. Arthur Seymour and then Roseanne Wolf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Mr. Mayor, Members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| I am here on behalf of the developers of Joshua's Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| but also, which is Duncan Construction, Don Duncan, and Sentinel Builders, Gary Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| But I am also speaking on behalf of the residents of Joshua's Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4922)|
| 1:22:08| who have invested a large part of their life savings in the new homes there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4928)|
| 1:22:13| people who walked by homes in Joshua's Landing but cannot at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4933)|
| 1:22:19| and people who hope to soon go to work in Joshua's Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4939)|
| 1:22:23| And I would ask those people to stand up since they have come out also on a very rainy night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| to discuss this issue with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Also available here for questions, Mr. Don Duncan, Mr. Gary Duncan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4954)|
| 1:22:40| Mr. J.B. Turnmire, who is a professional engineer who has worked with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4960)|
| 1:22:47| Mr. Dennis Huffla, who has done geotech studies for S&ME,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| and Mr. Gary Tucker and Robert Campbell with Robert L. Campbell and Associates Engineers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4974)|
| 1:23:01| They are here to answer questions if you have them about any phase of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| We ask you to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| This property was acquired by Mr. Duncan in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| At that time, it was outside the city limits of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| It was zoned RB under the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| This allows up to 12 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| It was developed as condominiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5007)|
| 1:23:30| To date, 31 have been built, 25 have been sold, 38 remain to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| It will be built out at 3.9 units per acre, which is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| It is in accordance with the general plan of the city of Knoxville, the North City Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5024)|
| 1:23:51| and every other plan that regulates it within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5031)|
| 1:23:58| This is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| It is a well-built subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| You'll hear from Ms. Wolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| She and her husband, David, moved into there a short –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5046)|
| 1:24:12| well, she can tell you exactly when she moved in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| And they like it, as does everyone else who has moved in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5055)|
| 1:24:21| In June of 2007, when this property was finally notified that it would be annexed formally into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5061)|
| 1:24:31| a lawsuit that had been filed by the predecessors entitled Ray Lee Jenkins on behalf of his family would be dismissed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5071)|
| 1:24:39| we had a meeting, Mr. Duncan, his engineers, and I with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| We invited their inspection of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5085)|
| 1:24:49| And ultimately, we submitted this use-on-review plan for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| MPC has reviewed the plan, and Mr. Donaldson's memorandum emphasizes that it has been reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5094)|
| 1:25:03| Traffic reports were filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| Permits have been filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| All permits that this development needs have been obtained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| and were obtained prior to it coming into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5112)|
| 1:25:17| We are more than happy to work with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| if they think there are any more permits due or any more work that needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5120)|
| 1:25:25| But in spite of what the opponents have said, these houses have been built well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| They are not cracking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| They have not flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| And certainly this year would be a year they would flood if they were ever going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| because we're having record amounts of rainfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| But we feel that this is one of the finer subdivisions in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| People who have lived in Fountain City all their life and are downsizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| or want a home where they do not have to do all the yard maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5156)|
| 1:26:00| are the type who are wanting to move in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| I do not have the benefit of Dr. Smoot's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| I do not have the benefit of traffic reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| I know, however, that Mr. Duncan has hired the best available in this area to work on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5169)|
| 1:26:18| has had all of the plans reviewed, has all the necessary permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| and that as MPC stated, this plan meets all the requirements of the zoning ordinance for this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5185)|
| 1:26:34| And we ask that this appeal be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| The streets are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| The utilities are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5199)|
| 1:26:40| He wants to go forward and complete the subdivision so new neighbors can move into Fountain City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| or transfer within Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| And these people who had bought in Joshua's Landing, relying upon a development plan that has 69 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5210)|
| 1:26:59| can soon have their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| We'll be happy to take any questions at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5221)|
| 1:27:05| You have Ms. Wolfe signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5229)|
| 1:27:10| And Roseanne Wolfe, who she and her husband live there, will come forward now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5230)|
| 1:27:24| Ms. Wolfe, if you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| My name is Roseanne Wolfe, and I live at 5078 Dovewood Way in Joshua's Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5248)|
| 1:27:35| My husband and I were the second family to move into Joshua's Landing, and that was in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5255)|
| 1:27:43| So we've had ample time to watch the neighborhood develop and grow and the homes be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5263)|
| 1:27:50| and everything that goes on in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| We lived for 49 years on Fairmont Boulevard, and when we had to move because my husband had some health problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| then we drove all over the city of Knoxville looking for a neighborhood that we would like to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5280)|
| 1:28:07| And after looking around, our hearts were still very close to North Knoxville and the Fountain City area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| because that's where our roots are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| And when we heard about Joshua's Landing, we went out to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| but then we also decided to check into other projects that Sentinel Builders had done before deciding on this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5300)|
| 1:28:28| And so we looked at Plantation Springs and Tassel Point and Bradford Place and Hannah's Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5308)|
| 1:28:36| and we spoke to the people that lived in those projects, those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| and they all praised Sentinel Builders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| and felt that they were very happy with their homes and the building and the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5327)|
| 1:28:53| And so we were very happy to be able to stay close to our home territory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| And we also were very happy to be taken into the city of Knoxville because we've always been city folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5339)|
| 1:29:06| We, too, love Fountain City, and we love that neighborhood, and we love our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| And at our age, it probably will be the last home that we buy in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5352)|
| 1:29:18| As one of the people speaking for the opposition said, it's a beautiful neighborhood with wildlife around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5358)|
| 1:29:27| And I go out at night and stand there, and I listen to the frogs just making their music down in the pond there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5367)|
| 1:29:34| And I saw a baby blue heron there the day before yesterday, and I've seen several blue herons in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5374)|
| 1:29:41| The wildlife hasn't been frightened away by this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| They seem to like it very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| I feel like Gary Duncan and Don and all the staff at Sentinel Builders are people of integrity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5386)|
| 1:29:54| and they're very professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| And so I urge you to consider and vote in favor of completing this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5397)|
| 1:30:05| and I feel like it will be a real asset to the city of Knoxville and to the people in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| Okay, questions from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5414)|
| 1:30:17| That's all that signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| There's a two-minute rebuttal from those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5421)|
| 1:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| I'll learn the rules here after six or seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| A few minutes ago I failed to mention also that we have discussed this with the city engineering's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| Mr. David Hagerman, and I think he, if he were here tonight, and I don't believe he is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| would verify that the development so far has had a significant impact upon the amount of groundwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5439)|
| 1:30:46| that is being delivered to this area, and a further expansion is only going to make it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5446)|
| 1:30:52| In listening to the individuals who spoke in favor of this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5452)|
| 1:30:58| I was particularly interested in the fact that I heard not a single one of them mentioning whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5458)|
| 1:31:05| or not this development was compatible with what was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| And that, ladies and gentlemen, as your attorney told you a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| is one of the prime considerations that you must look at in deciding whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| or not this development should fit in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Is it compatible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| I agree with Ms. Wolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| It's very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| The neighborhood out there is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| And we're glad to have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| We're not trying to throw the people that are there out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| We just don't want it to expand anymore because it's not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| And no one has come in here yet and shown us why this high density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5494)|
| 1:31:39| and I know Mr. Seymour says it's not high density, but why these condominiums are compatible in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| They're simply not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5505)|
| 1:31:47| And to allow them to start now, to gain a foothold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| is going to signal the end of the type of neighborhood that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| So, again, we respectfully ask that you grant our appeal and deny the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Councilwoman Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| I think I want to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| Comments have been made about the groundwater issues and the runoff, the effect on First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5524)|
| 1:32:11| And Mr. Hagerman isn't here, I don't believe, but Mr. Johnson is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| And he heads the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| Brent, are you in a position to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| From my perspective, they appear, based on the design plan that we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5545)|
| 1:32:32| to have met all the requirements of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| I think some of the downstream flooding or the potential runoff they've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5557)|
| 1:32:44| could have been as a result of the heavy rainfall that we've had this year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| At this point, they're not finished with the stormwater facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| All I can comment on is what we have reviewed on the design plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| There's still some work to be done on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| As far as the groundwater concerns, Knoxville is full of karst topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| You always have groundwater concerns, and it's very hard to predict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| There were sinkholes in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| A more specific question I could address, but those are general comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| If you have a more specific question, I'll be glad to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| How do you handle a situation, and I know it has happened many times over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| where a project begins and the planning stages are off when the property is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5611)|
| 1:33:39| and then it becomes annexed for whatever reason into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5619)|
| 1:33:44| Describe the process and what is anticipated and how the city handles that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5624)|
| 1:33:52| since those regs are different in the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| Ms. Pelo, I can generally answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| When the property is annexed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| we honor whatever outstanding permits they currently have in the county until their completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| Thank you, Gabby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| Mr. Reichman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| I've got sort of a follow-up question to Ms. Pelo's on the stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| I don't know if it's for Mr. Johnson or somebody with the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| and it's kind of a simple question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| Does all the stormwater runoff go into the ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| and then gets discharged into the wetland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| or is there a direct flow from this development into the wetland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| Could I have our engineer answer that, Gary Tucker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5678)|
| 1:34:51| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| My name is Gary Tucker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| I'm with Robert Campbell and Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| I live at 721 Fan Street in Tazewell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5698)|
| 1:35:05| Can you repeat the question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Well, I guess the question is, does all the runoff go into the ponds that are built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5707)|
| 1:35:12| or is there any direct runoff into the wetland itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| We do have some bypass area that flows directly into the wetland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5715)|
| 1:35:23| But early on, one of the first things that was done was we established a 50-foot buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| around the wetland area, and then beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| we constructed what we call a sediment trench that is five feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| and two feet deep with a row of silt vents on each side to filter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| to collect sediment and to protect sediment from entering the wetland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5746)|
| 1:35:52| And where is that trench at in the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| It follows the perimeter of the wetland area, just on the upstream side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5754)|
| 1:36:02| So you have the sediment trench, then you have the 50-foot buffer zone undisturbed before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| and then it enters the wetland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Let me just ask another broader question about that, is what should the wetland look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5775)|
| 1:36:21| I mean, I was out there on Saturday or Sunday at some point, and there was water all in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5781)|
| 1:36:26| lots of staining water, but we had rain that morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| Is this a wetland that should have water on a regular basis or should not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| And I guess what are we doing to make sure we maintain the wetland in the way nature intended it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5792)|
| 1:36:40| I think the first time I ever visited it, it was completely dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| I wouldn't have even thought it was a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| But, you know, the studies that we had done and the delineation work that we had done said that it was a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| And with the rain that we've had this year, it's more obvious that it's a wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| And the stormwater calculations that we did with the detention basins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| and considering that there is a small area that bypasses the detention basins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| the overall peak discharges to the wetland area were balanced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5827)|
| 1:37:13| so that they didn't exceed, after development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| that they didn't exceed the pre-developed conditions for all the storm events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| including the 100-year storm event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| And that would be the city code would require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| So assuming everything works according to code, that would be the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| All right, good. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| Thank you. Other questions? Okay, Ms. Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| This question is for Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| And, Mr. Johnson, you were very helpful to me on the telephone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| in terms of understanding pre-development and post-development impacts with a situation like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| And I think one of the comments that was made by the opposition was a concern that this council not facilitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5869)|
| 1:37:58| further development that would become a liability for city taxpayers somewhere down the road, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5878)|
| 1:38:04| 20 years from now when perhaps you and I aren't doing this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| And my understanding from you is that you are comfortable with the post-development flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5888)|
| 1:38:20| as compared to the pre-development flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| And I don't want to speak for you, but I want to make sure I understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| that if the storm water is handled appropriately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| then it will filter out into this watershed at the same rate, it just may last longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5912)|
| 1:38:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| Could you give the example that you gave to me because it really clarified things for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5919)|
| 1:38:43| Sure. By typical city regulations, and again, this was originally designed based on county regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| but it appears that they held the same storms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| If you look at the design and if it is constructed per the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| then you will have more volume of flow, but it will not exceed the pre-development rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5936)|
| 1:39:06| So, for example, the example I gave you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| if somebody is getting water within two feet of an air-conditioning unit now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5948)|
| 1:39:13| that profile will remain the same after development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| and the water will still be within two feet of the air-conditioning unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| It will just last for a much longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5960)|
| 1:39:22| If it had been one day previously, then it may be two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| So the rate is the same, it just may last longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| It will just carry over a number of other days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5970)|
| 1:39:31| Another thing that you and I talked about was my concern that the residents of Joshua's Landing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| understand what the responsibilities are of the city ongoing with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| And, again, this would be a concern with future liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| And my understanding is that there are private streets and roads within this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| And so the city's responsibility regarding private roads does not include things like paving, snow removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=5993)|
| 1:40:03| striping, street maintenance of that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6003)|
| 1:40:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6007)|
| 1:40:08| All of that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6008)|
| 1:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| I know there's been some concern expressed by the opposition that because this street infrastructure is built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6010)|
| 1:40:16| on an area of karst and caves and wetlands and all, that perhaps the street infrastructure would not last a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6016)|
| 1:40:24| If any of it would fail, it would be the responsibility of the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6024)|
| 1:40:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| So it would not be the responsibility of the city to come in and fix those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| And the services that the City of Knoxville does provide in this case is the garbage pickup and the fire protection, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6034)|
| 1:40:42| And my understanding at this point is that the brush and leaf removal is just done up at Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6042)|
| 1:40:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6049)|
| 1:40:50| There was some discussion about the setback of the lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| And when you have the private streets, it's all considered one big lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6058)|
| 1:40:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6059)|
| 1:41:00| And so the required setback is only off Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| It's not to the individual units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| And Tom could probably better address that, but that is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Well, I guess I'm just concerned that everybody understand where the liability is for the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| so that if 20 years from now we have a situation where the streets fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| or there's some infrastructure problem relative to the superstructure underneath of the Karst and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| that these are private roads and this is a private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| and it is the responsibility of the Homeowners Association to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| Any questions for Gary Duncan, Don Duncan, Robert Campbell, or their engineer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| It pertains to the construction of the streets inside the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6102)|
| 1:41:47| Why don't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| What is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Maybe I can direct you to the proper one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Are they being built to city standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| We thought you'd know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| That's why I didn't mention him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| I didn't do the testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| My name is Don Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6124)|
| 1:42:05| I live at 4929 Brown Gap Road in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| At the time the roads were built, they were built and inspected by the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| met all the county specs, which, as my understanding, is the same as the city specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| I'm not sure what the county spec is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| I can't address what is shown on the plan, and what is shown on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| The depth, the eight inches of base, two-and-a-half inch of binder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| and one-and-a-half inch of surface course is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| On two of the streets, they are more narrow than would be required by typical city regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6154)|
| 1:42:41| In previous developments that I've done that has private roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| they inspect them just the same as if they're public roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| We have to conform to their inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| Have you dedicated the roads to city or county before, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6171)|
| 1:42:55| We have not private roads, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6177)|
| 1:42:58| Mr. Johnson, if they meet the standards, are they automatically accepted by the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| If there's an as-built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6186)|
| 1:43:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| Thank you, Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| Mr. Johnson, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| And just as a general note, I don't think people are mean to impugn the quality of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| that the Duncans and Sentinel builders done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| I think it's just, you know, they're not saying that it's shoddy construction at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6200)|
| 1:43:25| I don't think that's what people are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6205)|
| 1:43:27| And that's what I don't feel that way at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| But, Mr. Johnson, there have been, in going through the record of what was considered at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6209)|
| 1:43:37| there are ten notices of violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| and one's labeled the second notice of violation for this development, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6220)|
| 1:43:48| We have a record of ten notices of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6232)|
| 1:43:53| And on the agenda, though it's not this item, there is item 11E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6233)|
| 1:44:03| which concerns the city conducting drainage improvements for the 2009 Neighborhood Drainage Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6243)|
| 1:44:11| And it's in different parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| It's about almost $230,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| And one of those is in the district I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| It's in Harold Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| And Harold Hills, to me, is relatively close to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| Would you agree, Mr. Johnson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| Now, when's the last time that you're aware of any development going on in Harold Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6268)|
| 1:44:37| I'm not sure there's been any development in my tenure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| certainly as Deputy Director of Engineering, and maybe long before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| Well, long before any of us here, Harold Hills was, oh, Councilman Booker's smiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6285)|
| 1:44:51| so maybe he knows about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6291)|
| 1:44:53| While he was at a previous at the working for previous administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| there was a lot of development that occurred in Harold Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| which caused a lot of flooding issues and people were getting a lot of flooding in their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6303)|
| 1:45:11| The city actually had to go in and buy people out of their homes and knock the homes down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6311)|
| 1:45:16| and the area has lain fallow ever since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| I mean, I just kind of, as a general note, find it ironic that here's something that I don't think any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6321)|
| 1:45:27| has occurred since they started knocking homes down in the Tyree administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6327)|
| 1:45:32| that here it comes again, and this city and its taxpayers are being asked to pay approximately $230,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| for flooding remediation in this vicinity as well as other vicinities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6337)|
| 1:45:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Okay, right now, just as a reminder, there is not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6345)|
| 1:45:52| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| Vice Mayor Becker, were you reaching for your line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| I have been out before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| I went to see my new nephew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| I went out and drove the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| Think the world of the Wolves, very fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| And I've seen Gary or Don Duncan at MPC Excellence Award Centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| They're fine people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6379)|
| 1:46:21| But the issue isn't that in the quality of the people and the quality of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6381)|
| 1:46:27| I have concerns based upon the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| It was not just at MPC, but the record provided to us by both sides tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| and before the meeting that this does not meet the development plan guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| as Mr. Swanson referred to earlier pertaining to Article IV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| and the criteria for the use on review being permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| I don't think it's compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| It has caused problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| The proximity to Shannondale Road, Shannondale School, the traffic situation there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6415)|
| 1:47:02| and the reasons stated earlier tonight are basis for approving this development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6422)|
| 1:47:10| So I'll respectfully move to uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6433)|
| 1:47:14| There's a motion and a second to uphold the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6434)|
| 1:47:16| Any further comment or discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| Seeing none, we'll go ahead and try a voice vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6441)|
| 1:47:26| and then we'll see after that if we need to call roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| All those in favor of upholding the appeal, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6450)|
| 1:47:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| Those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| We better do a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6465)|
| 1:47:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6467)|
| 1:47:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6470)|
| 1:47:51| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6471)|
| 1:48:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6480)|
| 1:48:01| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6481)|
| 1:48:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6484)|
| 1:48:05| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| Chair doesn't vote on land use issues, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| Could you declare on the record that you elect not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| The chair is not going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| There's a 4-4 tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| We normally, obviously, typically have five or have a 5-4 one way or the other since we're missing one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| The chair does have the prerogative to vote, but hasn't typically voted on land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| and is not going to in this case either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| So the motion is going to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| Does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| Mr. Mayor, can you explain what that means to the folks in the audience who are out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| Well, then that would mean that the appeal, which the appeal of the MPC approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6529)|
| 1:48:55| The appeal does not pass, and so the MPC's ruling would stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6535)|

| 1:50:13| Is Jim here tonight, or Alvin, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| If I read this correctly, Mr. Nance, this is taking part of a city park, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6624)|
| 1:50:25| Has there been any public input opportunity before we get rid of a city park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6625)|
| 1:50:32| On the city park, there has not been any public on the city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6632)|
| 1:50:36| We have met with the Park and Recreation Department for the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| and we've worked out a resolution for taking care of the park and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| What would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| Well, in other words, we're going to provide funding back to the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| Speaking with the Park and Recreation Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6650)|
| 1:50:52| they would rather not have another park in this vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6652)|
| 1:50:56| because there are so many parks serving this community now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| They'd much rather enhance the existing parks in this community to better serve the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| So we're going to provide funding to the City of Knoxville Recreation Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| to help achieve that in improving those parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| Maybe this next question is for Mr. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| What is the closest park nearby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| And if you know, what's the distance to it, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6676)|
| 1:51:24| William Powell Park was probably the closest park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| Morningside Park is not that far away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6689)|
| 1:51:32| James Smith, there are several parks, Councilman, probably within a mile easily, four or five parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6692)|
| 1:51:41| Yeah, William Powell is within a quarter mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| Okay, I don't pretend to know what amenities each park in the City of Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6704)|
| 1:51:49| What are we getting ready to give up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| I mean, is this a totally passive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6711)|
| 1:51:53| I mean, it has a playground equipment, doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| What it really has, it has a basketball court, and that's pretty much the major feature for that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| If you're familiar with that park, it's adjacent to the Eastport Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| It's almost all asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| There is a playground piece of equipment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| It's probably 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| And frankly, I've never seen children playing in this park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| But we have put some effort to make sure it stays effective and safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6740)|
| 1:52:26| But I think Mr. Anderson also has been involved with the conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6746)|
| 1:52:31| But yeah, William Powell Park, James A. Smith Park are both parks within a half mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| and certainly would serve the community in that vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| And they have comparable amenities like playground equipment, basketball court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| The Chestnut Street Park, is that the Smith Park you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| The Chestnut Street Park is much closer than the Powell Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| And Hardy Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Union Square Park is another park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| Union Square is the one I'm thinking of, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Union Square and William Hardy Park, Dr. Hardy Park is there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6787)|
| 1:53:11| So really there are probably five or six parks within that immediate vicinity that services that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| And that's why we really have no serious concerns about losing this particular facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6797)|
| 1:53:23| That plus the fact that with the promise of being able to have some funding in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6803)|
| 1:53:29| to enhance those parks that are still remaining in the East Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6815)|
| 1:53:36| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6816)|

| 1:53:44| Just for Ms. Poplin, I just wanted to point it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| We got a slight typo there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| At the top of the second page it referenced 3.5 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6829)|
| 1:53:54| When you go down to the bottom to Section 1, it referenced 3.68 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6834)|
| 1:53:59| We do need to have Ms. Boyce just kind of take a look at that resolution to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| It referenced both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| It referenced the same CLT number on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6845)|
| 1:54:07| We just need to make sure we got the right acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| We'll check that and make it consistent with what's showing on the CLT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| Aren't there three zeros missing from what you all are paying the city for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6853)|
| 1:54:18| Well, let me mention to you that part of the reason we asked the city for the donation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=6858)|

| 1:59:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7158)|
| 1:59:19| Is there any update to the issue of trying to get this contract squared away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7159)|
| 1:59:24| If I recall correctly, we thought we were getting ready to move and there's a rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7164)|
| 1:59:29| definitive clause with the current provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| What's going on with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7173)|
| 1:59:36| That discussion, Council Member Frost, continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7176)|
| 1:59:40| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| The issue is over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| We're continuing to have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| That's why we're asking for the extension to the end of the year to determine all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| the various options that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Again, what we are in the process of doing and will accomplish one way or the other is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| an improved deferred comp plan for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7198)|
| 2:00:03| What we are being careful about here is for this in no way to have an adverse effect upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| them and to be, as we have described it to them all along, as a positive change for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7208)|
| 2:00:16| This complication has taken a lot longer than any of us anticipated to resolve, but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| hopeful to get close to it soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| What's the natural expiration of the contract with Nationwide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7224)|
| 2:00:32| What was the original expiration date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7232)|
| 2:00:36| This is probably, Council Member Frost, probably the third time that we have extended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7236)|
| 2:00:42| And if I'm not mistaken, we've extended it the other times 90 days and this being the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| longer period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| No, what I'm asking is what are they holding up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| I mean, when does the contract, when was it set to expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| Or what is it they're holding over the city's head, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7255)|
| 2:01:00| Well, it isn't the expiration of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| It has to do with the movement of funds from a fixed return account and how a penalty may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7262)|
| 2:01:08| or may not be applied to that, a market valuation, what they call an MVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| I think it's very technical at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7274)|
| 2:01:16| If you transfer those funds, in other words, any funds invested in it over a period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7276)|
| 2:01:23| five years, you do not incur the MVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7283)|
| 2:01:27| But if we were to leave Nationwide and go to another provider who had a different array| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| of funds and those funds were then transitioned, transported from the existing fixed return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7292)|
| 2:01:40| fund to the new, this would trigger the MVA and there would be a penalty, and that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7300)|
| 2:01:45| we're working to avoid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090728?start=7306)|
