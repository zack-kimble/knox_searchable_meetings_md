| 0:03:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=232)|

| 0:04:05| House, which would interfere, but they're also applying for a TABC permit, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| overcome that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=252)|

| 0:04:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| The task class has not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| We are waiting for inspection approvals from Building Inspection, Fire Prevention, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=265)|
| 0:04:30| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Do I have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| I'll make a motion to approve pending final documentation and proof of the TABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=280)|
| 0:04:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| If you look at their application, where they say what they're close to, Church Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| United Methodist Church, UT Learning Center, Berry Funeral Home, and Fort Sanders Regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| I think they've got the wrong built-in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| Could you take a look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| That has all been, what they're close to has been verified and checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| And so they're clear if they get the TABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| What are they close to is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Aren't they the one behind the crystal there on Cumberland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| They're the ones on Lake Avenue, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| So you mentioned, for instance, they're near the Tyson House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| That's not listed on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| No, it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| On the last page it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| It says 164 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=329)|
| 0:05:32| If you look through most of these applications, people aren't real sure what they're close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=332)|
| 0:05:37| to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| And they will frequently put a medical facility or a church or a school that actually is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| all that close to where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| But the proposition is if they get an ABC license, it won't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| It won't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| It will be a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| And they've applied for the ABC license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| What I'm saying is I don't have a problem in getting their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| It's just that what is listed ought to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Don't you think, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| That would be a good thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| But we have not in the past sent back applications because people did not exactly list what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| close to where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| Mr. Wallace, Counselor Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| I'm not in favor of recommending approval until they've taken the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| I've been pretty consistent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| I'll make a substitute motion that's postponed until these things are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| Until the task class is completed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=397)|
| 0:06:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| Sergeant Hunter, did they apply for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| They just haven't taken it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| There's no preregistration for the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| It's held every Thursday from 10 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| It's held on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| When is this going to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| We open the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| And just so you know, on the task class, our Food and Beverage Director will be going this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| Thursday and I have plans to go next Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| From 10 to 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| So it's in the works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| It's on the calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=426)|
| 0:07:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=429)|
| 0:07:10| That was my question just as to when they were going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Councilman Wallace, since you made the motion, do you still want to, what do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Well, the other stuff's not done either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| I mean, they don't have, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| They haven't finished the building, so they don't have all their, it's not like they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| waiting on just this one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| They don't have their inspections done either, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=446)|
| 0:07:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=448)|
| 0:07:29| And they don't have their ABC permit either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=449)|
| 0:07:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=451)|
| 0:07:32| When in August are you thinking that this will open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| Around the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| And I've talked to Mike Gillespie and I also talked today to the Health Department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=455)|
| 0:07:39| both of those are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| They're coming out and Mr. Gillespie told me that he already has plans for the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| piece and that that would be a part of the beer and the TABC piece as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| So we have had conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| Our next beer board meeting is August 20th, which would be the day before all of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| So we have a motion to postpone until August and we have a second for that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=479)|
| 0:08:09| Vice Mayor Pavlis, do you want to come up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| I mean, I can understand the task, but to reference the other issue, I mean, we, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| very few that ever come before us, to be honest, that have a complete record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| All the files are complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| So I guess I would ask Councilman Wallace if there were other, I mean, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=503)|
| 0:08:30| your position on the class, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| Well, the other stuff's not done either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| I mean, if you were sitting here waiting, they're not ready for that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=514)|
| 0:08:39| But mainly the task class, I think we drew, or I drew, or I tried to draw a line months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=519)|
| 0:08:45| and a year ago and say, if you hadn't had the, I'll give up on the building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=525)|
| 0:08:50| You know, those are pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| But if you haven't had the task class, now this, you know, then I think that's a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| of demarcation for me that just says, okay, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=536)|
| 0:08:58| I'm not going to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| And you've been consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=539)|
| 0:09:01| And I can appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=541)|
| 0:09:03| But the other, I just want to make sure that the other issues weren't an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=543)|
| 0:09:07| I mean, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| The other issues are not, but they're not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| They can't be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| I mean, the construction's not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| But it's not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| So, I mean, I would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=556)|
| 0:09:18| That in and of itself would not be an issue, I guess that's the way to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=560)|
| 0:09:21| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| But, you know, as she says, they're going to the classes, you know, the F&B person is going this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| followed up by her the following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| So, I mean, I think that they're doing their diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=571)|
| 0:09:33| And, again, they will not get a beer permit until this is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| It's not like they slide in and, you know, they won't even be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| So to put them up against this type of a timeline, if we did postpone it, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| would be an injustice to them, particularly for the amount of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=588)|
| 0:09:53| and what they've been able to do for that area over there and the investment that they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=593)|
| 0:09:58| So I would hope that we would not approve this substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| And Councilman Greer, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| I just agree with my colleague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Would you like to turn your light off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| I have something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| No more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| Can't see that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Ms. Mitchell, can you move this way a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| That's why I had my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Well, I respect what George said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Here, the biggest problem we've had is when we have people who have received beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=628)|
| 0:10:36| and then they serve minors and, you know, they're back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=636)|
| 0:10:42| They're brought to task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=642)|
| 0:10:43| You're going to be right by the university where the temptation to look the other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=643)|
| 0:10:49| because everyone's going to look sort of young is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It's an important hurdle to cross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=652)|
| 0:10:55| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Can you come back on the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Because it's still before your projected opening date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| We'll give you a chance to get some of those ducks in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| I think we would feel more comfortable if you had touched the base before you try to round home here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| May I ask a clarifying question about coming back on the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| The process at that point, if we come back on the 20th, is it approved immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=675)|
| 0:11:19| and we pick it up from this day at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| If you have all the little blocks checked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| If every duck is lined up, including the TABC license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| then you would walk out of here at the end of the meeting with the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| We'll be happy to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I cannot promise about the other inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Well, we hope they're all done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Now, Vice Mayor Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Well, I mean, I think she makes a great point with the other inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| And, again, I mean, they will have been completed by about three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| You know, both task class will be completed, you know, well in advance of their opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=712)|
| 0:11:58| So, again, to put them up against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| I mean, has there ever been a situation to where we inadvertently gave a beer license out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| I mean, I've been sitting here since 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| I don't remember it happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| I don't believe it's ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| It won't ever happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| So, you know, again, to put them through this, you know, when they're trying to get open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| they don't have a clientele of young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| It's business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| You know, they're somewhat of a leisure hotel, but they're more of a professional clientele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=749)|
| 0:12:35| It's not where a bunch of college kids are going to hang out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| So, I mean, I understand what you're saying there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| And, again, they will have completed everything that they've needed to complete by the time that they open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| So, you know, I would ask that they be able to focus on getting their business open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| and be able to proceed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| We're sending final documentation of all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Councilman Wallace, do you have anything else to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| She's willing to accept it, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| She says it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| So, I mean, I think the thing that I've seen in 18 months is that we've got people before us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=788)|
| 0:13:16| that have been they went through it and they still served and they're underage served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| and they're right back in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| If you don't hold these people accountable, I mean, I understand they're a fine organization and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| but, I mean, it just seems to me it's discretionary when we don't stick to at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| that you've got to have the task force done or the task class done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| It just seems to be a pretty minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=815)|
| 0:13:37| It's taught every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| You could have taken it last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| Well, one of the things that I've noticed in looking at the data over the years that I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| is that the people who are required to have the most training, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| if they're serving alcohol, their servers are going to have to have additional training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| are the ones that tend to violate more than convenience stores, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| So I will not be supporting the substitute motion because I think it's important for this business to open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| I think that they will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Is your beverage manager from here, from coming in from someplace else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| Yes, ma'am, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| He is coming from another position, and I was just going to make a comment about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| is we would have met the task requirements by now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| but he's just now joining our team from another employer where he was not required to have the task training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| So it is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| We do understand that, and we appreciate it, and we will support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| So whatever, you know, this committee decides, we'll be happy to comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| But I appreciate Mr. Pavlis making the comments that he did because it is very difficult to get a hotel open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| a $17 million hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| It's been very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Yeah, and, you know, I understand Councilman Wallace, and I appreciate his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=890)|
| 0:14:56| We've approved him in spite of that, and, you know, and I hope we will again tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| And, sure, she's going to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| I mean, she's not in a compromising position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=905)|
| 0:15:07| You know, they're not in a position to compromise with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=907)|
| 0:15:11| I mean, everybody's going to say, well, yeah, whatever you all say we've got to do, we've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| So, I mean, I can appreciate her standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| If I was in the reverse role, of course I'm going to say whatever you all want me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=919)|
| 0:15:24| But I know that the preference would be having open businesses to be able to concentrate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| They've committed to do what they're going to do, and I feel confident that they will do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| And I feel even more confident that there's no way that they could get a beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| if they don't complete all the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| So I'll shut up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| My only question is where do you draw the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| I mean, we have some others that have not done the task force either, or tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=953)|
| 0:15:54| And I just think that, you know, we have rules and regulations, and people know what they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| And I think that if you start saying, well, this one can do it and this one can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| then we're going to have a real problem in terms of being that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| So I'm still, I second the motion, and I still go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| I want to call the question, and let's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| The question is, do we postpone approving this application until April 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| August the 20th, not April the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Oh, my gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| We're through football season by then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| Until August the 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| And so if you vote for this amendment, you are voting to postpone until August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| All those in favor of postponing say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Let's have a roll call, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Councilman Campin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Councilman Della Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1006)|

| 0:16:48| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Chairman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1012)|
| 0:16:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Councilman Steyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| This failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| So your application has been approved pending final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| You're going to have a second vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Now we've got to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| I'm hitting myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| I think it's going to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| We're going to move for approval pending final documentation and proof of the TABC certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1030)|
| 0:17:15| We already have all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| So now we're voting to approve their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Now, you are ready to go with the application when everything is done, including tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| the TABC permit, and all the inspections for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1050)|

| 0:17:42| Next is Indulge Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| And this is on the Old Fats site that Councilman DelaVaughn has diligently tried to keep moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1072)|

| 0:18:01| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| We need building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1083)|
| 0:18:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| Before we have discussion and vote, tell us what Indulge is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Indulge will be a soul food restaurant and bar, and we will have an ABC license as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| It's actually in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1106)|

| 0:18:28| Take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Although Councilman DelaVaughn has been working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| It's actually in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| And you're going to take full credit for getting this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Meet you there for the black-eyed piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| I'm going to ask them about the menu after we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| And this is all subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| Now, do you want to ask him about the menu?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I want to ask you about your menu for your soul food restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| What are you planning on having?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I don't have to name everything, but just tell us a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| You name it, we'll probably have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| We'll have baked grilled ribs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| We'll have meatloaf, chicken grilled and fried, greens of every type you can name, black-eyed peas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1144)|
| 0:19:12| When are you planning on opening, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| I believe the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| End of August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| Well, I'm glad to see the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| Somebody opened the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| It's been empty for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| But I haven't really seen outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1164)|
| 0:19:26| Are you going to do anything, any improvements outside of the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1166)|
| 0:19:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| We'll be adding a patio outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1175)|
| 0:19:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| The next is Hai Di Thai and Japanese cuisine on Melrose Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| I hope I pronounced that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Could you give us your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1193)|
| 0:20:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Will you pull the microphone down a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| This is in Vice Mayor Pavlis' district, and this 823 Melrose is within 300 feet of Tyson House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1206)|
| 0:20:16| So I'm going to ask her a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1216)|
| 0:20:18| Are you going to apply for an ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Have you applied yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| You have applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| How far along are you in the process of getting an ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| Do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| You mean TBA for wine permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Yes, a wine permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| I tried to contact the people, but I haven't gotten back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| So right now you are applying for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1251)|
| 0:20:53| You have not yet actually filed an application for a wine permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Vice Mayor Pavlis, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| I want clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Have you actually filed the document, the paper, the paperwork to apply for an ABC and for a spirits license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1265)|
| 0:21:14| or you just talked to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| I just talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Because I'm not sure at first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| I tried to done with the beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| But I didn't know because I think it's my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| I think the Tyson House is not the shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| Because I saw my building next to me, 821, they still sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1296)|
| 0:21:43| And he is the one who pushed me, oh, you better have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| That's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1307)|
| 0:21:48| What is the name of the restaurant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Gus Dairy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Gus Tom Dairy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| It's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| It's been there a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Councilor Frost, I know we spoke earlier, and I apologize we didn't catch back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| And we had the situation years ago with Tyson House and that very argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| So if you can enlighten us as to what we did then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1329)|
| 0:22:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| Well, this was more than a dozen years ago, long before I was even on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1332)|
| 0:22:17| And I'm only familiar with it from the news reports and speaking with Mr. Swanson today about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| There was a question at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| It's a restaurant that has since come and gone out of business about the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| The council at that time determined that the Tyson House was not a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1353)|
| 0:22:41| The Tyson House filed suit disputing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| In the meantime, the restaurant seeking the beer permit went out and obtained a TABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1364)|
| 0:22:52| As soon as they obtained the permit, then city code section 4-66D went into effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1372)|
| 0:23:01| which waived the distance requirement and the lawsuit was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1381)|
| 0:23:05| So there was no formal adjudication whether or not Tyson House was or was not a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| So the applicant before you, similar to the Hilton Garden Inn, if they're able to obtain an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1392)|
| 0:23:21| the distance requirement under the city ordinance goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| and they are able to then serve both what the ABC permit would provide for as well as beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1413)|
| 0:23:36| Quandary, quandary, quandary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| So you have not filled out any paper or submitted any paperwork to the state of Tennessee for your ABC license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| Not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| I mean, one possible solution, this is a little different, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1430)|
| 0:23:58| from the Hilton Garden Inn is that they have already started the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| This one is somewhat different that it hasn't begun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| I mean, you know, one potential alternative is to postpone it to allow this applicant to file for an ABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1448)|
| 0:24:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| I want to make a motion to postpone this for 28 days until the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1461)|
| 0:24:28| I mean, we've got two issues here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Obviously, what could come back before us is what, you know, Mr. Frost has described,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1470)|
| 0:24:37| that we'd have to make the decision about whether or not we consider Tyson House a house of worship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| or just a place for the young people to meet or whomever on campus there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| So, I mean, you know, I just, you know, if you'd filed the paperwork, I could probably move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| try to move forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| But I feel like the postponement is probably the best avenue to take at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1499)|
| 0:25:04| And so do you understand what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1504)|
| 0:25:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| You understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| So we have a motion to postpone this until August 20th and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1515)|
| 0:25:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1526)|
| 0:25:27| We will see you back here on August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| During that time, I think that you're going to get your TABC license application going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| After I have done TABC, that means I can walk out with the permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| You could do that, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| That means I have to come to a meeting on the next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| You have to come on August 20th and you will get a notice to come back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| And hopefully you're just really down the road with TABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| The next case is Christopher's at 4928 Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1558)|
| 0:26:06| And this was formerly Club Exile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| And my latest communication this afternoon from Allison in the law office is that this is going to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1569)|
| 0:26:20| The assets are coming to you in early September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| Yes, they're coming September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| And meanwhile, the business is operating with Mr. Ellison?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| All of this means that we need to postpone this because we can't have two people at the same address holding a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| So, Mr. Frost, would you like to step in after Councilman Grieve says what he has to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1601)|
| 0:26:51| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| Well, I was going to make that motion to go ahead and postpone on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1617)|
| 0:26:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Do you want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| I wanted to know a little bit more about what it is that you have planned for this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| You know, what will it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Is it going to be the same as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| It's going to be very similar to what it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| It is going to be Christopher's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| It will be an alternative nightclub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| And we are expecting to close on the business on September 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| I assume you're aware of the situation that we've had in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| In that particular place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| There's been some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| There will be some challenges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| No, there has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Yes, there has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1658)|
| 0:27:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Mr. Frost, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Just briefly, Section 4-58 only allows one permit per location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| So, we can't have two floating around for the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| And that's what Chairwoman Palmer was referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| Councilman Grieve, do you want to make your motion formal now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Make my motion formally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| Did we postpone for 28 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Actually, September 27th would be the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| What do we do in this case where they're going to close?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| Where they're going to close on September 3rd, but our meeting is August 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1693)|
| 0:28:20| Yeah, it's the surrender of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| And they also have at least one more inspection to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| So, we have a motion to postpone in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| August, what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| The 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| But they'll have to surrender their beer permit, right, before we can approve it at the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| We can approve pending the surrender of the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| And I promise you that Ms. Day will not allow Christopher's permit to walk out the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1729)|
| 0:28:55| until Club Exile's permit is in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| She's very good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I would not want to tangle with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Next is 711 Incorporated on Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Sergeant Panjwani, 711 on 1822 East Magnolia Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| We were missing the criminal background check for the owner, Malik Panjwani, until yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1762)|
| 0:29:30| She arrived with a family member to help translate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| What they did was they went up to the KPD records window and paid for a local background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| The problem is Malik lives in New York City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| So obviously a local background check will not show any history since she doesn't live or work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| This procedure was explained several times to several different representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| So we have several options before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| We need to have Malik Panjwani's New York records in hand before a license can be issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| Ms. Dyer, what about the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| We need a certificate of zoning from MPC and the surrender of the former permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| So we really need to look at the option of postponing this until August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1816)|
| 0:30:23| Do I have a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1825)|
| 0:30:26| I'll make a motion that we postpone to the next billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| So you need to have all of your inspections and things done, and KPD needs to have Malik Panjwani's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1836)|
| 0:30:44| Records check from New York State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| She went to New York State Police Department, and they asked that the business is in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| so you need to go over there and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| So it was kind of miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| So she is right now, I guess, in New York, and she's going to try to get that as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| That will be super.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| And when she gets it and it gets to KPD, that will be one more thing to check off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| And we'll see you on August 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1873)|
| 0:31:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| The next is Shuck, Raw Bar, and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| I know that several of the owners have not yet completed their application or the task class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| And Ms. Day, did you have some communication today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| I did get a request from the office manager that they would like to be deferred to the August 20th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| and that written copy is in the paperwork that you were given tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Do I have a motion to defer until August 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| And we need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| All those in favor of postponing to August the 20th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=1922)|

| 0:33:36| but they're withdrawing their beer with dance permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2016)|

| 0:33:44| Voting on the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| We need a motion first to allow them to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2028)|

| 0:34:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| And you can pick up your permit at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Can you tell us a little bit about, I mean, Wash City and More, what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| Yeah, it's a laundromat facility, and we have a next door, which is space we are trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| to do like beer, tobacco, and some groceries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2088)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2090)|
| 0:34:51| This concludes the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| Next, we move to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| What about Aubrey's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Did they show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| We're going to do them after the administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| The next is the Hilton Garden Inn on Peregrine Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| Your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Fred Bullard, 260 Peregrine Way, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Sergeant Hunter, do you want to tell us about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2119)|
| 0:35:20| The first sale to a minor occurred on September 25, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| The person cited was an employee, Rebecca Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| She did not card the informant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| The disposition of her case was dismissed on cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| The second one occurred on June 28, 2013, to Shannon Lockridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| She did card the informant, and the case is currently pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| We've had two communications from you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| One was that you were going to close the pantry, and then we have a second communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| that says that if somebody purchased something from the pantry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| they'll have to be ID'd at the front desk of pay there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Number one, we're not closing the pantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| The pantry is there for the hotel guests only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| It's not there for the public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| We've been in business ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2170)|
| 0:36:12| We've got a four-seat bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Rebecca did not sell to a minor on the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2176)|
| 0:36:24| She opened the bottles as they brought them over to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| She didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2188)|
| 0:36:29| She thought they were hotel guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| So that was thrown at her citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| She was not cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| It was dismissed in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| The second one, after we retrained everybody again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| and I have viewed the videos of the night that it happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| Shannon had guests in front of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| When the sting happened, they walked into the pantry, and when she got up, they walked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2212)|
| 0:37:00| The young lady put hers in front of her, and I assume the other gentleman was the agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| He had his beer over by him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| She did ask for the ID as she has been trained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Either she misfigured or looked at the wrong date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| She couldn't really tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| She took money from the agent and the young lady at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2238)|
| 0:37:25| So she did sell to the minor, who was the young lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| She has been terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| We have removed all beer and wine from the pantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| We will not sell it through there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| Basically, the front desk has caused us to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| It's embarrassing, but it happens, so we're here to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Yes, Councilman Delaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2275)|
| 0:37:56| So as I understand what you're saying is you've eliminated the entire process that led to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| by getting the beer out of that service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| You're no longer doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| We still will serve beer in our lounge or our little bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| but we will not sell it in the pantry anymore because I just can't take any more chances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| with another sting coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I mean, you have to be 21 to stay in our property in the first place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| unless you're with a legal guardian, a parent, or with a team and they have guardians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| We don't allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| So the desk clerks get used to not carding people because everybody has to be 21 to stay with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| The lounge has the training to deal directly with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| We had a training session this past Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| We went back over our policies and what they're supposed to be doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| both with the lounge people and with the front desk people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| So in essence, you're saying you've eliminated the entire process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| But I've eliminated the problem in the pantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| We're just not going to sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| Can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| I mean, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| I'd like to have it there for our guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| We're a business hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| We don't have people walking off the street to drink in our properties usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| But your management decision was, well, instead of trying to control that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| you just do away with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| They didn't leave me any choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| The board needs to make a decision now to accept the plan of the Hilton Garden Inn on Paragrind Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2352)|
| 0:39:19| or to send them to an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Councilman Grief, I think this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| What do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| What do you want to suggest or do you want to do nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| My recommendation is that we accept this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| and they are not in the same kind of a situation as a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| and that we accept this and hope that we don't see you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| And you don't want to see us either, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| No, I surely don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| Well, I was going to say, similar to what you said, Chairperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2392)|
| 0:39:56| that I think that they've really taken care of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| It's unfortunate that someone has to lose their job over this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| I will say that on the administrative hearing sheet that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| the sale to the minor was done September 25th of 2012 and then June 28th of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| That I think that we just ought to move on with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| and just make sure that it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| I think that he's made a conscientious effort to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| So we have no further action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Thank you for coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| We'll hope to see you in a more pleasant setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| That would surely be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| The next administrative beer hearing is Whiskey Dick's, 1912 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Steve Meisner, Nashville Bar, here for Whiskey Dick's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| Would you like to tell us a little bit about you were not here last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| and this beer board was extremely unhappy that there was not better representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2458)|
| 0:41:02| or an attempt to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| So right off the bat, we're not in a real good frame of mind about Whiskey Dick's, I would guess, looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| I don't see a lot of smiles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| You are located in Vice Mayor Pavlis' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| So, Vice Mayor Pavlis, do you want to ask any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| Do you want to hear them out first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| I think it would be appropriate to hear from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| And let me say first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| A lot of the problems associated with this particular case arose because of the new strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| of the Tennessee ABC administration that came in beginning of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| beginning of this year with Staff Attorney Jenna Winfrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| She has, and this isn't to excuse bar owners and restaurant owners from citations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| and serving underage consumers of alcohol, but the pilot program for the ABC requires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2508)|
| 0:41:55| or the pilot program that's been adopted by the Tennessee Legislature requires that the ABC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| communicate with the local beer boards when they come down due to an ABC violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| When that happens, oftentimes the bar owners, and this has happened twice now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and Knoxville has happened to my clients three times in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| what ends up happening is if the bar owner isn't aware that there could be a subsequent action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| by the beer board, they're subject to a double penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| And what happened in this particular instance, just so that we're all clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2542)|
| 0:42:26| the offense happened in March of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| The ABC notified Whiskey Dix in April of 2013 and then executed an agreed order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2550)|
| 0:42:40| with the Whiskey Dix owners to close the facility down for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| That order and the term of the suspension was for 15 days from June 23 until July 8 of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2566)|
| 0:42:53| This board was not notified until two weeks into the suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| So the ownership, when it came up here last time, and I was here, Chairperson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| I was here for Tin Roof at that time to deal with a very similar issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| The difference between the Tin Roof suspension and the suspension for Whiskey Dix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| is that I was notified and alerted the ownership that they needed to address the beer board as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| as the ABC before they agreed to a voluntary suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| And when I talked to Keith Bell and Jenna Winfrey about that exact issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| the position of the ABC, which is a new position of the ABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| is that they have absolutely no responsibility to tell the owners that they have to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| with the local administration before they enter into an agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| Now, and I know you said I had 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| No, I said five minutes, and you've got two left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Two left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| The Tennessee statute that I've been referring to is codified under 575108,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| and I have talked with Counsel Frost about this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| And it says that the beer board suspension shall be to the same extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| and for the same period of time as the ABC suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| And it goes on, and I've heard positions from Jenna Winfrey and from Keith Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| that the ABC has changed its interpretation of this provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| and do not believe that that necessarily is the case, that it has to run concurrently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| And what I would draw this body's attention to subsection 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| which says that the owner can take the position not to appear before this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2659)|
| 0:44:26| and when that happens, the statute says that pursuant to 57-4202,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2666)|
| 0:44:32| it must be for the period of time included in the decision of the Alcoholic Beverage Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2672)|
| 0:44:37| So our position is that the statute created a problem for Whiskey Dicks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| in that the ownership believed that once the ABC acted and entered its agreed order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| that was all the suspension that was needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| and frankly, they only needed to appear here out as a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Now, that doesn't excuse not paying the $500 and providing a remediation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| We've submitted those to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Those are before you now, and I believe they've been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| Last word, the remediation plan, the sole problem that was created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2704)|
| 0:45:09| by both of the suspensions that occurred at Whiskey Dicks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| of the violations at Whiskey Dicks, had to do with not that the individual wasn't carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| They were both carded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| The second time around, the individual that was carded was written on her hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| with a sharpie, and it said no, meaning do not serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| and the bartender served her anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| The problem at Whiskey Dicks that led to the two violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| that cause Whiskey Dicks now to be before this body was service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| after the person had been carded and deemed to be under 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| The remediation plan that we've submitted eliminates that problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| by requiring all patrons to be 21 years of age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2742)|
| 0:45:46| So we do not expect this to be a reoccurring problem at Whiskey Dicks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| So when the doors of Whiskey Dicks open, if you're not 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| you cannot cross the threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| We've already implemented that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| We've made it part of the plan with the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2761)|
| 0:46:05| Do we have any discussion or comment from this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2765)|
| 0:46:10| You know, I think you point out the real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2770)|
| 0:46:13| was not going ahead and paying the fine and the remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| and I still am a little fuzzy as to why that didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2778)|
| 0:46:25| The reason why that didn't happen was because the ownership of Whiskey Dicks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| until it came up before this body, and I can tell this entire board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2788)|
| 0:46:32| I've represented the ownership of Whiskey Dicks in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| and other places in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2795)|
| 0:46:37| Had we known that that was going to be part of the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| I was already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| I was here on that same meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| The confusion came up because of the ABC's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| of entering into an agreed order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| and then sending the agreed order to Chairperson Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| And just the reason why I laid out the time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| was we didn't even get notice of the show cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| until we had already served 10 days of the suspension for the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| So there was a real miscommunication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| There was a remediation plan submitted, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| The only issue was not having the $500 fine paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| prior to the beer board hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| and as soon as we learned of the way the disposition came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| in the last meeting, we immediately cured that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| All right, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| Okay, well, I'm going to recommend that we send this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| to the hearing officer to sort out all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| and look at the suspension that you serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| the suspension that the law requires that you serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd130723?start=2858)|
