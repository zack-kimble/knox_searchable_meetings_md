| 0:01:53| So we're now going to go ahead and turn the workshop over to our planning and development group who will talk to us about some changes in ordinances and give us some, some overviews there is a presentation my assumption Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=113)|
| 0:02:08| Johnson is that CTV has access to that to be able to share with the public as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=128)|

| 0:02:29| Yes, thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=149)|
| 0:02:31| Mayor McKenzie it's great to see everybody this evening I'm just going to get us kicked off and probably turn the really hard work over to some folks who I'm just going to introduce here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| We have Amy Brooks, who I think everyone knows she's just been through a marathon planning commission meeting so we're glad she's joining us this evening she is the interim executive director of planning now and so I also just want to sort of publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=161)|
| 0:02:57| Yes, after tomorrow, Gerald green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| Last day is tomorrow. So please make sure to give a shout out to outgoing director green and welcome incoming interim director, Amy Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=180)|
| 0:03:16| It's great to have her here. She will be presenting along with Brian Barry, the deputy director of zoning and development services with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=196)|
| 0:03:26| We also have on the phone from the law department and Aaron Gill, who is also deputy to the mayor and chief policy offer officer. And I'm sure if we need a lifeline Peter Aaron's who's the director of development services is also also on here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=206)|
| 0:03:48| So it feels a little bit like a recode reunion. And hopefully, that is a positive experience for everyone and not a traumatic one. We're going to try to make this short and sweet and also hopefully informative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=228)|
| 0:04:06| And so, the issue on the table that will probably require the majority of our time this evening is the proposed amendment to the zoning ordinance that applies a transition rule to former planned commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=246)|
| 0:04:23| And it's a little complicated and I know it's it's been a bit confusing. So, we're going to cover some ground that may feel a little bit repetitive and it may not necessarily feel relevant because but I think it's important because the way that mission rule is written right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=263)|
| 0:04:45| We have former plan commercial districts that are subject to, and that's a zoning designation and they're subject to a process that's in our new zoning ordinance that the administration and our partners and planning feel like isn't isn't an appropriate process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=285)|
| 0:05:03| Commercial districts, so we want to kind of lay that out and allow council to have some discussion so that we can have some direction on how to address those former plan commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=303)|
| 0:05:15| We have presented a proposal, which is to remove and sort of go with the underlying zoning ordinance, but council may want to discuss some alternatives to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=315)|
| 0:05:26| So, with that said, I'm going to turn it over to Miss Brooks, and thanks everybody for being here tonight. It's good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=326)|
| 0:05:45| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| See the screen, the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| Yes, we can. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| Okay, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| And as Stephanie stated, what we're going to do, or at least what I'm going to do here initially is provide you with some background information to help guide that conversation that we're hoping that you're going to have this evening to give us some input on the direction moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=356)|
| 0:06:14| So, this slide and the one following were taken from slides we used as part of the process to update the city zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=374)|
| 0:06:22| This process, as you all know, is known as recode and the old ordinance did not reflect adopted plans or current trends and what we heard also was that it was not as user friendly as it should be for not only developers, but for the community and for the professional staff at the city and here at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=382)|
| 0:06:43| So these are just some of some of the goals that were put in place three years ago so implement those adopted land use policies, creating a code that's more user friendly and developing a more transparent predictable and consistent code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=403)|
| 0:06:58| And then, allowing development to occur without those those special approvals that which we call views on reviews which most of you are familiar with now they're referred to as a special use, and then, and then you zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=418)|
| 0:07:12| So specific goals were identified for the commercial districts and since we are specifically talking about transition rules for previously zoned plan commercial, we wanted to review the goals outlined during the update process for these for these districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=432)|
| 0:07:28| So refocusing and refining our commercial districts reflecting objectives from our adopted plans, which is allowing for a mix of uses and all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=448)|
| 0:07:37| And these three commercial zones CGCH and CR were created specifically to address the types of development found in those formerly zoned plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=457)|
| 0:07:49| Plan commercial zones. So the intent addressing these former plan commercial districts was to level the field for for all applicants and create more consistency in the development standards and increase transparency in the process of development review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=469)|
| 0:08:02| So the same development standards apply to all development these districts and are not subject to staff or planning commission interpretation or or conditions of approval that might vary from project to project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=482)|
| 0:08:13| And this here is just to provide a quick comparison of the former plan commercial districts and the plan development process which are two, two very different pieces here so the four key elements are the purpose, the process, the level of public involvement and how modifications to plans approved under each are handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=493)|
| 0:08:34| So I'm not going to read this over to you but it's really is meant to be a resource for you and I'll get into more detail here as we move along in the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=514)|
| 0:08:43| So per the old zoning ordinance, these were the plan districts, and you'll see underneath them, and the orange color their stated intent and you'll notice that the shared purpose and intent across all four of these are very similar so unified development uses rational placement of activities thinking about access parking landscaping, and they're all related to the scale of the plan and most of these were larger in scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=523)|
| 0:09:13| So as I just mentioned, you know the purpose and intent of these former plan commercial districts was defining the range of permitted uses encouraging better design requiring landscaping incorporating lighting standards, encouraging for those larger sites, a more comprehensive development plan and all these elements are now addressed in the new code under the CGCH and CR districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=553)|
| 0:09:44| So all former plans and required a two step process so first step was a rezoning, which came before the planning commission, and then went on to city council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=584)|
| 0:09:54| And then the second, what we call the use on review of a development plan and this only required planning commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=594)|
| 0:10:03| And then any substantial deviation from that use on review approval that development plan by the planning commission would have to come back to staff for a recommendation to the planning commission so that that second step was something that council never saw unless there was a feel of planning condition planning commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=603)|
| 0:10:26| There was no public benefit that was required there's no type of negotiation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| And I have a link to this I'm happy to send it to you I know, you know, based on some of the challenges that the city has experienced, we created this map, it shows all of the plan commercial the previously planned commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=632)|
| 0:10:44| I'm happy to send that out as an additional link and we can refer back to this if we need to during the discussion, but just for a brief review so the total properties in the city there's 75,000 75,547 properties in the city, and 822 of those are formally approved plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=644)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=666)|
| 0:11:12| So now we're going to get into the plan development process so under this this new plan development process property owners or applicants initiate the process for a project that doesn't quite fit into any district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=672)|
| 0:11:25| The plan development process is encourage developers to be creative and think about how their project might benefit the city and the surrounding community, and the exemptions to the underlying district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=685)|
| 0:11:38| You know, can be approved as part of the process but in general, unless those are approved as part of the part of this process the underlying district applies, and we'll touch on that here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=698)|
| 0:11:53| But just gets into a little more detail of the process so again the plan development is a process it's not a zoning district, and it lays out it lays over the underlying zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=713)|
| 0:12:05| There's no specific plan development types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=725)|
| 0:12:08| Again, it's just treated as a type of approval process and is multi step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| And there's number of different points of public input and a high level of transparency you all seen a couple of these. So far, they require pre application meeting with our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=733)|
| 0:12:25| There's an optional concept plan that they can they can come before the planning commission and receive some initial feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=745)|
| 0:12:33| It does require a preliminary plan which goes before the planning commission and requires City Council approval and then the final plan requires planning commission approval is a bit of a negotiation for higher quality development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=753)|
| 0:12:46| There's, you know, public amenities and benefits that that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=766)|
| 0:12:51| There's some examples there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| And then there are changes that are allowed that both major and minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=774)|
| 0:13:01| So these are just some of the examples of exemptions that may be granted. These are just some of the reasons so you know does it promote the justice of the city and development doesn't enhance the quality of design and the site plan is it compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=781)|
| 0:13:15| with adopted plans as it provides some type of public benefit to the city and is it going to cause any type of adverse impact to neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=795)|
| 0:13:26| So here's some examples of public benefits. This is not an exhaustive list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| See here you know preservation of existing environmental features are they staying off the hillsides are they preserving steep slopes and and use that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=812)|
| 0:13:49| The effective approval, the final plan constitutes the development regulations applicable to that specific property, the, the plan development must be developed in accordance with that plan, and any kind of violation of conditions associated with it would be a violation of the code, and would constitute grounds for revoking all the approvals granted on the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=829)|
| 0:14:16| There are minor modifications that the Planning Commission can approve. And there's major modifications that would require both Planning Commission and for it to go back to Council, and I will say that the Planning Commission can take any of those minor modifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=856)|
| 0:14:31| and say if any changes happen in terms of some of those are all to give you a couple examples so an increase or decrease in building height of 10% increase or decrease in building coverage of 10% Planning Commission can say anything, any kind of minor modification would have to go to City Council so there's, there's a little bit of leeway in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=871)|
| 0:14:50| And so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to turn it over to Brian Berry, he's going to walk you through some of the challenges and opportunities with these commercial sites that are related to the transition role and question today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=890)|
| 0:15:04| Thanks a lot, Amy. Can everyone hear me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, we can. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| I'll go ahead and start. As Amy kind of said, what I would like to do is take this time and kind of walk you through and put some context to this and so I'm going to give you three examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=912)|
| 0:15:24| She stated the transition rules for these former planned commercial areas in state that they are subject to the plan development amendment procedures in the new ordinance and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=924)|
| 0:15:37| in that last slide that she talked a little bit about any redevelopment on these former planned commercial sites would be considered likely minor or major modifications and so as a result they would require Planning Commission, City Council approval, or possibly both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=937)|
| 0:15:54| So the first example I want to look at here is the Kroger at 9225 Kingston Pike. This one was zoned PC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=954)|
| 0:16:03| This is at the corner of Kingston Pike and Cedar Bluff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=963)|
| 0:16:07| This was approved back in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| And so one of the things I want to point out here is I want to consider, I want you to consider rather, I guess some of the changes that have taken place since 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=970)|
| 0:16:20| In 2015, the city updated the sign ordinance and part of that update included everything from a reduction in the number of permitted signs to the size of signs, the type of signs that are permitted, so things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=980)|
| 0:16:37| Also in 2017, the parking regulations were updated and what this did is it provided some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| One of the major things with creating minimum and maximum number of spaces for various users instead of a fixed number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| It also created bicycle rack requirements and it has language in there as well that says if you ask for a reduction in parking and you're within a quarter mile radius of a transit stop, the city can also require that you make improvements to that transit stop by providing a shelter or things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1013)|
| 0:17:12| So to work with CAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| And then finally, we have in 2020, the new zoning ordinance that was adopted and that incorporated a lot of new requirements such as landscaping, buffers, outdoor exterior lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1034)|
| 0:17:28| And so many of these things that I just talked about from 15-17 and the current zoning ordinance, these were only found in the planned districts at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1048)|
| 0:17:38| And one of the options that that provided at the time for the planned district was because the old zoning ordinance was somewhat restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1058)|
| 0:17:48| And so that's one of the reasons why people would go through these rezoning processes to go through the planned commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1068)|
| 0:17:57| So back to this example, in 2011, this was approved in the parking requirements for this retail sales shopping center over here where Kroger is, was four and a half spaces per thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1077)|
| 0:18:13| And so their site plan was approved with 672 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| And so they actually went above what the requirement was at the time in providing 4.8 spaces per thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1098)|
| 0:18:25| And you can kind of see there to the left of the aerial photo, that site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| And so the new parking regulations in 2017, they allow for a minimum of three parking spaces per thousand square feet for retail sales and use, which is what this would fall under today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1112)|
| 0:18:45| So when you do the comparison and you take the total building area of this plan at the time, which was 141,323 square feet, the requirements of the minimum of 424 spaces is what's required as of today if this were to be developed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1125)|
| 0:19:05| So they could potentially lose up to 248 spaces for redevelopment on this parcel if they, if they chose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| Now, of course, they wouldn't lose exactly that number of spaces because any new type of redevelopment would require some parking as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1153)|
| 0:19:21| And that would have to be counted into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| But I think the point is, is there is an opportunity for redevelopment based on the change in the parking requirements that the city updated back in 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1162)|
| 0:19:32| So this example, this would likely fall under a major modification and it would require council approval as the transition rules are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1172)|
| 0:19:41| So if they chose to to do some out parcel construction and redevelopment on this site, that's what they would likely be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1181)|
| 0:19:51| As we look to the next slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| Amy, if you go ahead and move to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you. So these are the conditions that were approved at the time with that in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1200)|
| 0:20:08| There are 15 conditions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| And what I'm not going to do is go through each one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1211)|
| 0:20:14| But what I want to do is illustrate and kind of point out a larger theme here is that nine of these 15 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| They're about meeting the requirements for various organizations that are already in this review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| So, for instance, like the first one says meeting all applicable requirements of the Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| Well, the city currently reviews development based on the Knoxville zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1232)|
| 0:20:37| And as you go on down, there's requirements for city engineering, for TDOT, for the Knox County Health Department, for the city arborist, for BZA approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1237)|
| 0:20:47| So there's an element that the these things are already taking place in the review process for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1247)|
| 0:20:56| A couple of things that I want to point out specifically, though, on here is like item six is a landscaping condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| which requires that the proposed landscaping shown on the plan be completed before the issuance of an occupancy permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1263)|
| 0:21:11| Well, the new zoning ordinance has landscaping requirements, which are for all multifamily, non-residential parking lots, things like that, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1271)|
| 0:21:22| So landscaping is now covered. Item 13 is another example where provisions for a space of bicycle racks to be scattered along the storefronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1282)|
| 0:21:32| Well, that's something that was added to the 2017 update of the parking regulations with regards to bicycle parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1292)|
| 0:21:40| So that's being met as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| So I think my goal here is to kind of show you that a lot of these conditions are either already being done to some degree in a review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1301)|
| 0:21:51| or they're now being captured with the updated regulations that we're currently using based on the 2015-2017 and then now the 2020 zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1311)|
| 0:22:03| The next slide here. This is the second example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| This is the Kroger at Broadway. It's at 5201 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| This was a former target that was demolished and this was approved back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| Same scenario here. This was an example where 319 parking spaces were approved with this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1339)|
| 0:22:26| And so in the time they provided four parking spaces per thousand square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| And they also went through a variance approval process because they couldn't meet at the time what was the 4.5 required for any type of shopping center like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1352)|
| 0:22:43| So based on the new regulations, they're only required 239 spaces at a minimum of three per thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1363)|
| 0:22:51| So technically they have around 80 or so parking spaces that they could potentially look to redevelop or to have some type of out parcel on if they so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1371)|
| 0:23:03| So, again, this is an example of where transition rules would apply here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| And so any kind of modification to this would go probably to commission or council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1387)|
| 0:23:14| Now, I know specifically that there were some concerns around this one regarding driveway entrances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1394)|
| 0:23:21| I think on the Gibbs Drive, there is a right in right out that was approved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| There's some concerns around a trash compactors location and some landscaping, sidewalks and bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1406)|
| 0:23:36| Those are things that in the review process that I kind of talked about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| city engineering looks at and addresses a lot of sidewalk issues now associated with new developments and connectivity, as well as ADA accessibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1421)|
| 0:23:51| TDOT, this is a Broadway state route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| So TDOT as well would review this for a long for regarding entrances and locations and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| The new zoning ordinance that also addresses things such as landscaping, buffering the requirement again of the bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| So any kind of reduction here in parking being within a quarter mile radius of transit would require potentially some upgrades to bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1448)|
| 0:24:18| So I also know that there were some concerns about this with regards to the singular monument that was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1458)|
| 0:24:25| as well as loading docks being located in a particular side on the Knox Road side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1465)|
| 0:24:32| And to that, I think there are some tradeoffs in that some things the code will allow for and they will permit if redevelopment does occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1472)|
| 0:24:42| And this would not be under the PD modification approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| And so I think that's something that you kind of have to weigh and figure out a level of comfort with those tradeoffs moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1485)|
| 0:24:53| So, again, here's the 14 conditions that were approved of this, and I'm not going to go through all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1493)|
| 0:24:59| But I just wanted to point out again that, you know, the requirements in general are part of this review process are being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1499)|
| 0:25:07| And then there are other things, again, where the new zoning ordinance is meeting those requirements, such as the landscaping, the bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| Number 14, about exterior lighting. Exterior lighting is now part of a requirement in the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| So all that to kind of illustrate and show that I think a lot of these things are being incorporated into the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1520)|
| 0:25:30| And so the last slide here is a good example of what to do with this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1530)|
| 0:25:41| So this is Windsor Square and this is at 297 Seven Oaks Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| It is SC3, so it falls under the transition rules as well. But this one was developed in 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| And this is where a big lots and a Burlington Coat Factory is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| You could look at this and you could say this could be considered as an underperforming shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| You can see based on the aerial photography, there's a sea of asphalt there for parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And so the potential for redevelopment there is pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| So that's something to consider as well as these transition rules and how they impact not only recent development within the last 10 to 15 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1576)|
| 0:26:26| but ones that are much further back than that. So I hope kind of illustrating with these examples that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1586)|
| 0:26:33| you know, to consider about how the current transition rules impact redevelopment of these planned commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1593)|
| 0:26:40| So at this point, I'll turn it, I think, over to Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| And Stephanie, if you want to talk a little bit about the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1604)|
| 0:26:49| Sure. Yes. So this is kind of a wrap up as well. So thanks again, Amy and Brian, for that good overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| And again, I know for some of you, this is a lot of information that you may have already been aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| But hopefully for some, there might have been some new nuggets of information or the review can be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1623)|
| 0:27:11| So some of the challenges that we either have already seen or we're anticipating with the existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1631)|
| 0:27:20| the way that the ordinance is written right now and the transition rule is that these former planned commercial districts were created by rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1640)|
| 0:27:32| And went through a development review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| That's a very different scenario than the plan development tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1657)|
| 0:27:45| which is requested by the property owner and is a multi-step process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| So I think that maybe what you've heard through both Amy and Brian is that in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| the planned commercial districts were a bandaid for a zoning ordinance that was somewhat outdated, antiquated, restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1679)|
| 0:28:12| and had some it honestly some impacts on surrounding communities that were not that were not very favorable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1692)|
| 0:28:22| So planned planned districts were formed as a part of a bandaid to to address some of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1702)|
| 0:28:31| And we feel like the the new zoning ordinance addresses many of those as Brian outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1711)|
| 0:28:40| And planned development is a process within our new zoning ordinance that really isn't is not an appropriate process to apply to those former planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1720)|
| 0:28:53| We have some concerns that development, it will prevent development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1733)|
| 0:28:59| that we have property owners that will take a look at the planned development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| which is intended to be requested and will say, you know, we're not really interested in going through all those hoops to to redevelop our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1746)|
| 0:29:18| It's just going to make it more difficult for them. So requiring properties with previously approved development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1758)|
| 0:29:28| It's going to add steps, discourage redevelopment. And we really feel like the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| although as we have realized, it's it's not perfect and we weren't aiming for perfection, but we feel like it's raised the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1775)|
| 0:29:44| And it has the potential to create new, high quality, transparent development that had a lot of community input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1784)|
| 0:29:54| that our property owner and developer community also agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| And we we would hope that council sees it in the same light and that this transition rule can be either eliminated for former planned commercial districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1799)|
| 0:30:14| or we can have a serious conversation about how to address the barriers that the way it's written right now are creating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1814)|
| 0:30:24| So with that, I will open it up for questions or turn it back over to Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1824)|
| 0:30:33| And I think the presentation portion of this particular topic is is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1833)|
| 0:30:45| Council, do we have any questions or comments? Councilman Ryder, we can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1845)|
| 0:30:52| You're still you're still on mute. If someone else has questions or comments, I'll let them go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| But if nobody wants to speak, I'll speak. Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| OK. You sure nobody else wants to go? I'm giving you guys time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| Is this warning Councilwoman Ryder? You just need to warm up Lauren and we'll tag on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| No, I. OK. Have I made noise about this before or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1878)|
| 0:31:26| OK. I just want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| OK. Planned commercial was an important tool before we elevated our standards and revised our zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1891)|
| 0:31:38| So we passed recode. We have a higher standard and that addresses landscaping and other standards that we were using plan to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1898)|
| 0:31:46| That's the problem is getting too confused using planned commercial districts to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| I agree 100 percent that we need to revise the transition rules that we passed in recode last year, which is what what is being asked of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1912)|
| 0:32:06| This is something that I postponed at a council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| I think it did a 60 day postponement so we could have this workshop and have a better understanding because there seemed to be some muddling and misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1930)|
| 0:32:20| Some of it may be on my part in speaking and confusing the terms at different conversations with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| So what I wanted to be clear is a formerly approved planned commercial district should not have to go through a plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1946)|
| 0:32:37| That is absolutely wrong. And that's something we need to fix from passing recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1957)|
| 0:32:43| What I would like to see is the transition rules, which we're not looking at in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| We pass the transition rules to keep everything whole and honor the agreements that have been made in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| And I know I kept beating the dead horse of the one example I knew, which was a sign and certain agreements that were made at the Fountain City program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1978)|
| 0:33:08| Because at the time I had asked for a list of the different developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| And I appreciate that Miss Brooks has said there's I think I wrote it down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Eight hundred twenty two. And they've now been identified and on a map and they can be sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| If it's only one sign at one development in the entire city, maybe it's not to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| I'm just asking what the harm is and having a transition rule that acknowledges a public notice process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| Are you some review for those formally approved plan developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| So here's my kind of closing thing is we've adopted a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| That's the argument for recode and why we passed it. But that higher standard is now our minimum standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2024)|
| 0:33:49| That's the minimum standard you have to meet to be able to do a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| The new recode. And if someone if a community and a developer agree to something that was higher than our new minimum standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2033)|
| 0:34:03| I don't want to wipe that from the books and take that away from the community without some notice or process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| And I feel like a you some review is an option for doing that plan development is in no way comparable and no way the right option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2048)|
| 0:34:18| So we definitely need to amend and I will definitely agree to that. So that's food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2058)|
| 0:34:36| I was just going to say, Vice Mayor McKenzie, do you want me to respond to that or or there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| I know there are more questions and comments. You feel free to go ahead and respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| OK. Yeah. Thanks. Councilwoman Ryder. And I appreciated the conversation earlier today because I have I think it left me with a better understanding of where you were coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2087)|
| 0:34:59| And I think at least we're on the same page regarding the the need to not have former planned commercial or planned districts go through the plan development process for for any redevelopment and changes on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2099)|
| 0:35:16| So what I'm hearing is, though, that we that what you would like to see is a way to ensure that there's at least a use on review process or some type of a public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2116)|
| 0:35:33| If those former planned districts make a modification on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2133)|
| 0:35:43| Is that what I'm understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Correct, because beating my one dead example that I know of because I didn't have a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| If we were to pass the amendment that was put before us, the Kroger Shopping Center, that shopping center could go and apply for signs that were five foot taller and and then multiples when the community negotiated a singular sign that was 15 foot tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2151)|
| 0:36:09| So the community negotiated something and got an agreement with the developer for something that was a higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| And I do not feel comfortable voting to wipe that from the books. I feel like that was the commitment I made in passing recode was not to take away things that were negotiated and working out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2176)|
| 0:36:29| And so I would not want a developer to have to go through a multi step process and go to NBC and come to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| I don't think that that's necessary. That's laborious. I use some review. Somebody wants to change their 15 foot sign to a 20 foot sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2196)|
| 0:36:45| I think the community deserves notice to know that that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| So those those examples may be few and far between, but where they exist, I'm hearing you. They may be of great importance to that particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2210)|
| 0:37:00| And that's where. Yes. And that's where I hesitate taking that voting for that particular change as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| And I think if the examples are few and far between, they will be minimal on the staff to have to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2227)|
| 0:37:16| And if it turns out we're wrong and down the road, this ends up being lots of works and we'll revisit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2236)|
| 0:37:25| As we are visiting it now. So what I sent to Miss Welch last night was the amendment we were asked to was to strike one for G part one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2245)|
| 0:37:35| And what I'm suggesting instead is to strike two and three, which is the parts of the code that specifically say treat them as planned developments and map them as planned developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2255)|
| 0:37:47| Those are not correlatable. I don't know if that's a word you can't. They're not comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| And so we passed that in air in the beginning. And I think we need to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| What it does say is the rule, the regulations and conditions of the approval remain in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2280)|
| 0:38:06| And if a developer wants to get out from that plan that was agreed to, then they would go through rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2286)|
| 0:38:14| And shirk their former plan development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| So, if it's helpful at all, Vice Mayor McKenzie and council members, Miss Brooks can actually pull up the section of the code that we're talking about that Councilman Ryder is referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2300)|
| 0:38:33| And Vice Mayor McKenzie, would that be okay if Miss Brooks shares her screen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2313)|
| 0:38:39| Absolutely. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| While she's doing that, just just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| I mean, we can work on this for sure, but it wouldn't be an actual rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| Because these former plan commercial districts are already, they have a zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| So, to remove this requirement, a rezoning would not be the process, but that's all a technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2344)|
| 0:39:13| There could potentially be another process to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2353)|
| 0:39:19| To remove the conditions of the previously approved plans commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2359)|
| 0:39:26| Which is part of what Mr. Berry was showing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2366)|
| 0:39:30| I'm hesitant to dump those without reviewing, and I hate to ask anyone to review 822 of them, but I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2370)|
| 0:39:44| May I ask a follow up question, Councilman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| What those conditions that were part of the plan commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2387)|
| 0:39:56| Is that the same type of conditions that are built into plan development now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2396)|
| 0:40:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| I don't know if Miss Welch wants to address that comment or Mr. Berry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| The conditions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| So, again, just as a reminder that these properties that were formerly in planned zones, they were planned commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2411)|
| 0:40:21| For example, they now have a new zoning designation under the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| Planned development is a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| The conditions related to the planned development process come about through the process of developing that planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2432)|
| 0:40:46| You're talking about, as Councilwoman Ryder said earlier, you're not even talking about apples and oranges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| You're talking about, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| Apples and kiwi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| Let me ask it a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| How were the conditions that were part of the planned commercial district for a specific property transitioned and attached to and retained for that property after recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2461)|
| 0:41:17| So, using your favorite example that I'm growing accustomed to, where is the agreement between the community and Kroger?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2477)|
| 0:41:32| If you look at the old code, it's recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| Well, I believe Mr. Green told us in a council meeting he didn't know where it was recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| I think it says in the code it's supposed to be recorded, not as a deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| It's either supposed to be in the building department attached to parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| Mr. Berry might be able to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Or Christina McGrath, who's on the call, or Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| So, if one of you would like to answer that question, that might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| This is Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| I can chime in real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I think what you're asking is, so for that use on review that was done with those specific conditions, those Kroger sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2524)|
| 0:42:13| Those are still in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| And if someone came in and they wanted to do something different on that site, it would get flagged by Plans Review and Inspection that there is an overlay on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2536)|
| 0:42:29| And they would send them to us and we would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| Because there is an approved development plan currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2553)|
| 0:42:42| Anybody else wants to add on to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| I was going to say, Amy, could you just repeat what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2565)|
| 0:42:53| If I'm understanding the question correctly, I think what you're asking is, where is that agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2573)|
| 0:43:00| Where does that live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| An old use on review that was approved for any of these shopping centers, where does it live?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| That list of conditions that Brian presented in the screens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2590)|
| 0:43:16| It's attached to, so when, for instance, if someone comes to us and says, we want to do X, Y, and Z on this property, the first thing we would do was look it up and look at all previous approvals for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2596)|
| 0:43:29| And it would say that there had been a use on review done in 1999, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Then we would go back to that use on review and review it as part of our review of their specific request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2614)|
| 0:43:43| So, you can find them on KJS and they're part of the planning files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2629)|
| 0:43:50| So, the answer to the question is it's kept in the planning files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2634)|
| 0:43:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Chairman Fugate has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| So, my question is, so oftentimes property changes hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| So, if somebody wants to buy a property, how do they know that this is on the property and that they are in comfort or whatever buy it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2648)|
| 0:44:22| If we're not real sure, if we're having a hard time figuring out where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| So, if I put my shopping center up for sale and then I, as a new developer, want to buy that shopping center and put some out parcels on it, how do I know what I am encumbered by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2668)|
| 0:44:46| So, just like other overlays, if it's a historic overlay, or if it's in neighborhood conservation, there are, correct me if I'm speaking incorrectly about this, any of the city or planning staff who are on the call, but it would be a similar, you know, when there's an overlay, it's attached to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2686)|
| 0:45:13| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| So, it would be when they list the property, they would say that this is what it's subject to. I mean, that impacts the value and the marketability of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2716)|
| 0:45:27| From a con, just people want to know what they're buying. And if they're buying it thinking, I can do this, but I can't, I guess. So, to Councilwoman Ryder's point, I'm not, and maybe this isn't to your point, Councilwoman Ryder, but I mean, I think people just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2727)|
| 0:45:45| it needs to be clear what the expectations are for folks who are either owning the, I see it happening more with people who buy an existing property with intentions of doing extra development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2745)|
| 0:46:02| I would say our concerns are echoed in the administration, Councilwoman Fugate, in that, you know, one of the objectives of recode was to make it very clear what the expectations are for development and redevelopment, and to set a bar that, that, you know, is higher and that we're comfortable with and make that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2762)|
| 0:46:27| And those requirements, very predictable to the greatest degree possible to property owners and developers. So, we would agree with that objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2787)|
| 0:46:46| I see Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| Thank you, Deputy to the Mayor Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| You know, I think what we've done is we've identified an issue. And I think we've talked about that everyone sees it in very similar light and the issue I think that's out there is, you know, what do we do for the fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2816)|
| 0:47:12| So, I think it's a very positive discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2832)|
| 0:47:16| What I think about with this particular issue is that Council is often asked and has traditionally tried to find a balance between things that are sometimes difficult to balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2836)|
| 0:47:31| And that goes to a little bit of what Councilperson Fugate was just talking about, and also what Councilperson Ryder was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2851)|
| 0:47:40| You know, we're trying to balance public review and promoting public participation and a meaningful opportunity for the public to be involved in a process, while also avoiding an overly burdensome process that really doesn't encourage people to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2860)|
| 0:47:58| A process that really doesn't encourage any development at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| The way I see this is that the solution we're presented with today accomplishes one of those objectives, it removes the overly burdensome process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2883)|
| 0:48:14| But it's seriously lacking on the other end of it, and it doesn't provide for that meaningful opportunity for public participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| So, as I see it, you know, similar to what Councilperson Ryder was talking about, I just can't support this particular approach the way it's being brought to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2902)|
| 0:48:35| But if we keep 1.4 G1 and we remove 1.4 G2 and G3, we would unburden property owners by getting rid of that burdensome plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2915)|
| 0:48:49| And at the same time, we protect the meaningful public participation provided in the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2929)|
| 0:48:56| That approach would maintain that delicate balance that, you know, previous councils and I think this council are continuing to try to foster, and that's something I could really support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2936)|
| 0:49:07| I just have a question because I am not nearly the land use expert that Councilperson Ryder and Roberto are, because I didn't live through RICO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2947)|
| 0:49:27| So, how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Yes, Stephanie's going, this is a refresher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| I'm like, no, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| This is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| I did not follow it quite so closely while I was here, I must admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2976)|
| 0:49:41| So, my question is about how long does the public process involve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2981)|
| 0:49:50| I'm not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| I'm just trying to get a sense of what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2992)|
| 0:49:58| Ms. Brooks, would you like to take that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| Councilman, are you asking for the use-on-review process under the old plan commercial or the plan development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3003)|
| 0:50:11| No, I'm talking about whatever Councilwoman Ryder and Roberto are talking about in some sort of public process yet to be named, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3011)|
| 0:50:19| Use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| So, with the use-on-review process, like I said, it's a little bit additional background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3023)|
| 0:50:31| So, the first step, like I mentioned, was the rezoning, which you all are familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| And then once it gets through the rezoning process, it usually takes two to three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3035)|
| 0:50:42| Then for the use-on-review process, that usually takes approximately two months, give or take, depending on the complexity of the project and how much back and forth happens between staff in terms of the review of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3042)|
| 0:51:00| So, I'm trying to figure out when does the public, I'm asking about the public piece, all the two months of use-of-review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3060)|
| 0:51:09| So, the use-on-review, the applicant submits an application to planning staff, planning staff does the review, and then presents it to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3069)|
| 0:51:19| And that is the public hearing that takes place under the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| So, it's one public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| So, under the former planned commercial districts, I think your question is, if we were to just stick with the same process that was used when these were planned commercial districts, it would be a use-on-review, which is one public hearing before planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3086)|
| 0:51:44| Unless it's a major modification, correct me if I'm wrong, Amy, and then it would require a vote by council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3104)|
| 0:51:54| I'm trying to figure out how much time burden, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| To Councilman Roberto's point, is this the balance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| I'm trying to figure out how long that would take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| You know, I think that was a good description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| The process with these previously approved planned districts, they've already been through the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3138)|
| 0:52:27| So, if you were to keep the process, the use-on-review process that was in these former districts, then it would be one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3147)|
| 0:52:37| It would be one public meeting, and there'd be an opportunity to do an appeal to council if you needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| That's not very burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| Now, if you do it the other way, which was what I think everyone was talking about we don't want to do, and that would be to send everyone through the planned development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3168)|
| 0:52:58| Now, that's way, very involved, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So, that would be incredibly burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| So, I think we're all talking about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| How do we accomplish both of these and balance them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| And it seems to me the best way to do it would be to maintain that one-and-you're-out, basically, process that you'd have with the former use-on-review in these particular instances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3191)|
| 0:53:26| Because remember, we're talking about the transition rules from previous to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| We're not talking about other things in this particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| So, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| I hope that helps answer some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| It does, if I could ask again another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| Y'all just have to humor me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3224)|
| 0:53:46| Don't go on mute, Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| Because Lauren's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| So, the two of y'all explain this to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| Is there a way that that would only have to happen if what they presented would take away something already agreed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3236)|
| 0:54:09| I think if they were going to make any change at all, they would have to go through the use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3249)|
| 0:54:16| And I could be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| But I think that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| So, I guess the point is focus on what is accomplishing both goals, what is not as burdensome, and what is providing the public process, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3261)|
| 0:54:38| So, if you do what's proposed by keeping the G-1, removing G-2 and G-3, then you still have the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3278)|
| 0:54:49| And it wouldn't be burdensome because these are already zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3289)|
| 0:54:53| So, all they have to do is say, we're going to make some changes, go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| And you're talking about potentially just one meeting without an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| But I'm no expert either, Councilperson Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| I just play one on TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Okay. And you do a fine job on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| So, if it's okay, Vice Mayor McKenzie, I would like to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| So, I appreciate the line that you're trying to walk here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| I think just from the administration's standpoint, that public process was really the three years that it took to develop RECODE and the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3325)|
| 0:55:39| And we set some standards that, although I understand Councilwoman Ryder, they're minimum standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| They're minimum standards that incorporate so much of what the former planned commercial districts were trying to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3345)|
| 0:55:57| And so, to ask a developer to go through an extra step to do something that wasn't part of the agreement on the planned commercial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3357)|
| 0:56:17| and it meets the minimum, the base zoning for that requirement, it really does feel like that balance is maybe swung too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3377)|
| 0:56:31| So, I think that that is a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| And I'm not, I mean, you all get to decide, but I just want to say that I think that Councilwoman Fugate's question sort of hits it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3394)|
| 0:56:44| I fully appreciate it, Councilwoman Ryder, and other concerns about if there were previous agreements, you know, I can understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3404)|
| 0:56:53| Neighborhoods and communities would not want to lose those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| But if we are being asked to, you know, hold developers to a higher standard with the new zoning ordinance, then I think we need to not then also ask them to go through extra steps just to meet those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3417)|
| 0:57:18| Can I say a couple things? I've had my hand raised. I don't know if anybody can see me with the screen up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| That's okay. I just want to clarify two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| I'm not asking to ask people to go through a meeting to meet a requirement that's not, that they haven't already agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3448)|
| 0:57:38| I'm asking them to do a use and review when they want to get out of something they already agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3458)|
| 0:57:44| They agreed to 15-foot singular monument sign at the particular location that I keep speaking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| If I vote for the amendment as proposed, they can then go apply for 20-foot signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3470)|
| 0:57:57| And I'm not comfortable undoing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| Yes, the recode process was a multi-year lengthy public process that everybody had notice of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| But part of that notice was the transition rules that protected those past agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| And I'm not comfortable not having something that protects or that honors those past discussions and agreements and undoes things that people had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3495)|
| 0:58:28| I'm not comfortable with the way the transition rules are written currently, but I'm not comfortable with the proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3508)|
| 0:58:37| The second thing that I want to say is to answer Councilwoman Fugate's question about what, how does someone know what conditions apply to their property when they go to buy it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3517)|
| 0:58:49| You want to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| In real estate, in my experience in buying real estate and my experience in living in an overlay district, the burden is on the buyer to know what your zoning is when you buy something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3532)|
| 0:59:03| In residential, that's commonly overlooked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| And we often have folks that will buy properties and then find out that they live in, you know, a residential zone that doesn't allow a fiveplex or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3546)|
| 0:59:18| But often, often you will see pending commercial developments are pending based on pending contingent on a rezoning at NPC or, you know, through the process of it being rezoned to what they needed or for the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3558)|
| 0:59:41| And one last thing that I will say is just looking at the schedule for the planning commission, the double fee deadline, so the drop dead deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3581)|
| 0:59:52| If you wanted to apply your next opportunity for use on review, if you know what I'm suggesting were to go through, you would have to apply by August 3rd and the meeting date is September 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3592)|
| 1:00:06| So that's about one month turnaround for that public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| So if we pass something and a shopping center goes, hey, we agreed to something that's different and we want to get out from underneath that or we want to change it, they would apply and get out from underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3611)|
| 1:00:26| If someone has a better suggestion, I'm open to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| And maybe I'm in the minority, I'm just not comfortable with doing that to the community that relied on their faith was buffered by the transition rules we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3631)|
| 1:00:41| Oh, just to clarify, I just want to be crystal clear because I do think this is so important. I appreciate so much people taking the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3641)|
| 1:00:50| You're not talking about people having to go through use on review if it was planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| If they're redeveloping the property, it meets all the base zoning requirements and it doesn't change anything that they agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| Originally, they could just go through the regular development process without use on review as long as it meets the zoning standards for the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3664)|
| 1:01:15| And it's not changing any conditions that were previously agreed to under the their former planned commercial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3675)|
| 1:01:25| Is that what I'm understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| Yes. If they agreed to something that was a higher standard than what we're asking for, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| Yeah. Meet the meet our standards and or not undo something that the community negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3696)|
| 1:01:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| I would have to leave it to our, our, our lawyers to figure out how to write something that specific, but that's really good guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3710)|
| 1:02:04| Thank you. So, Councilwoman Ryder, I agree it's the onus is on the buyer to know what your property zone as sorry about that. Did y'all hear a bunch of rumbling here at my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3724)|
| 1:02:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3737)|
| 1:02:21| Train of thought. Oh, yes, it's the buyers responsibility. How easy is that to find the find out this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3741)|
| 1:02:30| I mean, that's another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| So, this is Brian Barry plans reinspection. I'd like to comment a little bit about that and what we experienced from the plans review side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3753)|
| 1:02:43| Oftentimes, we will get inquiries from large real estate groups, corporations who are going to purchase shopping centers, and they'll request zoning letter verifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3763)|
| 1:02:55| They're wanting to know if we have a set of plans that were approved, if there were any variances associated with the property and what they were when they were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3775)|
| 1:03:04| So, things of that nature so that they can kind of it's kind of been said, do perform their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3784)|
| 1:03:13| And so that that's one of the ways that we find a lot of people will, especially on larger, higher profile properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| They'll reach out to a buyer would know to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| But you're right, like, just a residential homeowner. It may not be just or just one off buying a strip shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3804)|
| 1:03:35| Local person that hasn't done it a lot might not know to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3815)|
| 1:03:41| There are real estate agents, too, that can help with that and probably guide people through that process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you. I'll be quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| But to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| If there are certain criteria agreed upon by the neighborhood for a specific property that's findable with a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3832)|
| 1:04:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3840)|
| 1:04:09| Am I on mute? I think, Stephanie, are you on mute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Yes, Stephanie's on mute, but Tommy, you're not. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| I'm no longer on mute. Yes. I mean, it would be the same type of Mr. Barry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| You can correct me, but that that public record is available to neighbors as well as to developers, real estate agents, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3865)|
| 1:04:38| So, Mr. Barry. From what I understand, the question would be and tell me if you wouldn't mind just restating it again so I can make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3878)|
| 1:04:47| Yeah. Councilman Ryder has used an example where there's an agreement where the property owner has agreed to a certain element regarding signage that is different than the code allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3887)|
| 1:05:01| It's higher. Again, back to my original question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| That is somewhere documented to where a future developer or property owner that would like to buy that property could see that agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3905)|
| 1:05:17| Before they purchase the property. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| So there's a couple of different ways that they can access that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3922)|
| 1:05:29| Through KGIS, sometimes the overlay districts are shown on that, which will kind of notate that this is in a district where there was some additional requirements associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3929)|
| 1:05:44| Planning department. And you can talk a little bit about this more. They have a map that illustrates and shows all of the prior approvals from rezoning to plan commercial districts to use on reviews and various things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3944)|
| 1:06:03| That are associated with pieces of property and oftentimes attached with that are site plans, staff report and summaries that will give some some guidance as to what was approved and what's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3963)|
| 1:06:17| Those are two ways that that's available to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| And Brian, you're correct. So we also use KGIS. We have something called planning cases and a lot of individuals that are interested in particular properties will contact us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| You can search online. And I don't remember the year where we started to digitize everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3992)|
| 1:06:39| But most, you know, at least going back to the mid 2000s, you can find all of that readily available online. But then it's also noted when you're doing the property research that there had been a use on review or some type of development plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=3999)|
| 1:06:54| And then we can pull that up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Okay, so that specific property specific requirement or agreement is accessible. That's not an issue in this. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4017)|
| 1:07:06| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| Councilman Ryder. Just quick question. Is it not recorded with the deed or the plaque attached in any way to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4031)|
| 1:07:20| We registered deeds. Maybe I do not know the answer to that. Does it. Does anyone else. Miss Brooks or Mr. Berry or Miss McGraw's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4040)|
| 1:07:30| Part of the planning process conditions will be noted on the plaque. There will also be references to other approvals like the use on review approval or other things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4050)|
| 1:07:44| So multiple ways for property owners or potential buyers to find out about this, these conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4064)|
| 1:07:52| So, I just want to throw a question out there for counsel to get. I think I think we have an idea of, at least from the discussion I'm hearing the direction that you might be interested in us moving forward on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4072)|
| 1:08:04| And I'm going to encourage Miss McGraw's to answer any or to ask any questions she has, because she'll be taking a lead on helping us to get this written in the right in the right manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4084)|
| 1:08:18| I would like to propose for your consideration that we also have a provision for the removal of the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4098)|
| 1:08:27| So, this is essentially we're, we're saying that there's going to be an overlay on these former plan commercial districts within that overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4107)|
| 1:08:37| The any redevelopment would have to go through use on review if it changes previously agreed upon conditions that exceed the base zoning requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4117)|
| 1:08:49| So, I think we understand that. So, if a developer or property owner wanted to remove that overlay, would it be acceptable that they would be able to go through a process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4129)|
| 1:09:03| I would agree that they need a process to get rid of it, if needed, because in lots of instance, the point that Mr Barry made in his presentation is that many of the conditions were to meet the standards that we now have today and I understand that that's the reason that you guys aren't in that you guys aren't in favor of keeping some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4143)|
| 1:09:25| I don't know how to say what I'm saying. Anyway, you know what I'm saying. Many of them are moot, but some of them aren't. And so, yes, if all of them are moot, then it's fine for them to move have a process to move past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4165)|
| 1:09:38| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| I, I don't Vice Mayor McKenzie. I don't see any other questions about this particular topic. It is ten after seven. We've had you for more than an hour. I know that we said time permitting. We could discuss the sign moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4181)|
| 1:10:04| Moratorium. We just included one issue on there, but I know that there are two. So we can either table that or we can table that or it's totally at your pleasure. Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4204)|
| 1:10:21| I'm going to leave that up to Council. Council do the members that are that are in attendance. Do you guys have some additional time to stay on and have that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4221)|
| 1:10:31| Councilman Roberta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Thank you, Vice Mayor. Yeah, I think these are two very important issues and the moratoriums that we have on both are set to expire relatively soon. So I do think we we can press on and and and deal with those. You know, it wouldn't feel like an old RICO meeting if we didn't deal with multiple topics for a long period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4233)|
| 1:10:58| Councilman Ryder. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| Yeah, I was going to say, if we don't stay until one a.m., I feel like you all get cheated. So I'm kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4259)|
| 1:11:06| We might lose power before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| Apparently, Will has a backroom deal to cut the power off. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| I wanted to say, for the record, we we didn't even really get into plan development. And I had at some point had a discussion with Director Green about having a workshop on plan development itself and to talk about that because that's new and it's novel and we've thus far approved to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4273)|
| 1:11:35| And I think I have a lot of questions about it. I want to look at that. So I just want my colleagues to know that I would love to have a workshop. I know you guys like workshops on just plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4295)|
| 1:11:46| And I mean, you know, whatever else you want to talk about to all hours of the night. But I'd like to have a lot more time and discussion about plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4306)|
| 1:11:55| Thank you, Councilman Ryder. Councilmember Thomas, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| Yes, I think since we're all here, I'm available to continue on. And I think we can keep a majority here. We should do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4320)|
| 1:12:09| Okay. Any other comments? Okay. Councilman Testament, are you a thumbs up? Okay, very good. And thank you, Councilman Fugitt and Smith. Okay, well, we will move forward then. Thank you. We'll turn it back over to you, Deputy Director Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4329)|
| 1:12:28| Thanks so much, Vice Mayor McKenzie. And so just don't hate me when I ask for another workshop then, everybody. You heard it. I saw the thumbs up. I saw lots of, but, you know, we love talking about zoning and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4348)|
| 1:12:47| So we will go ahead and ask for a poll so that we can set up another workshop on plan development. And I would agree it's new and I think it's important to everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4367)|
| 1:13:03| I'll just say this about workshops. I know they do take up a lot of time, but they also save time when we get into the actual meeting. So it's not all a waste of time or any of it's a waste of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4383)|
| 1:13:17| Yeah, very good comment and feedback. Thank you. Okay, let's roll with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| More workshops. I like it, actually. It's a good, it's much easier to be able to really dive into an issue. So thank you. I actually really appreciate it. And I say that only partially joking. I really think it's important to dive into some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4403)|
| 1:13:39| So there are two issues that will be coming up in August on your agenda. And it's the expiration of a moratorium on signs in institutional zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4419)|
| 1:13:53| And then there's also a moratorium on new sign applications in certain zones. And so I am going to just throw out a lifeline to some of my colleagues to lead us through this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4433)|
| 1:14:10| We can start with the institutional zoning districts and then we can move to the moratorium for new sign applications in certain zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4450)|
| 1:14:20| My summary of this is going to be not something that you're going to want to hear, but these issues actually have been considered multiple times in multiple public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4460)|
| 1:14:34| And both the stakeholder advisory committee and the planning commission have and the administration are recommending no changes to zoning ordinance in relation to these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4474)|
| 1:14:49| And so we hope that when the moratorium expires, that we follow the zoning ordinance in relation to signs in institutional zoning districts and in the other designated districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4489)|
| 1:15:06| So I don't think we really rehearsed who would take this one, but I'm going to just throw it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| We have several good folks on the call who I think can speak to this. And I don't know, Ms. Brooks, if you want to jump in. Mr. Ahrens is also on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4512)|
| 1:15:23| But I'll throw it to Amy. She's off mute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| I'll start off by giving the timeline. I have to admit, Director Green was really the lead on handling these requests, but maybe if I start off with the timeline, it would help orient everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4527)|
| 1:15:39| And then we can take it from there in terms of talking about specific issues or if you guys have questions about the recommendations that came forward from Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4539)|
| 1:15:51| So on September 27th, there was a resolution from council requesting that planning commission make recommendations on potentially revising sign regulations for the new industrial zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4551)|
| 1:16:04| And also the process for allowing additional signage in certain commercial and industrial districts to be reviewed by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4564)|
| 1:16:12| On November 14th, the planning commission considered both requests for council's resolution and they voted not to make any changes to either one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4572)|
| 1:16:25| And then there was a bit of a delay somewhat related to the COVID pandemic, but the public stakeholder advisory committee also reviewed the planning commission's recommendations on April 22nd and they voted not to amend either section by a vote of 15-1 from that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4585)|
| 1:16:48| That's a little bit of the background that has been considered per council's request last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4608)|
| 1:17:03| Yes, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| Thank you, Deputy Mayor Welch. That's a difficult title to remember to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4626)|
| 1:17:15| You can call me Stephanie as I have called you many times. I definitely answer to that much more readily than the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4635)|
| 1:17:23| Very good. I think doing a little bit of background on this one is important too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| You know, one thing to remember is that at the beginning of the recode process, council had kind of set forth a goal of not making any substantive changes to the sign on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4649)|
| 1:17:44| And there were a lot of reasons for doing that, but it made a lot of sense to just leave that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4664)|
| 1:17:55| It's also important to remember that the institutional district didn't exist in the previous zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4675)|
| 1:18:03| So, since it didn't exist prior to recode, it was actually the only non-residential district that lacked a compatible or comparable zone that could fold pretty easily into the current zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4683)|
| 1:18:22| I think it was in draft four, the institutional district was there and it had no regulations for signs at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4702)|
| 1:18:32| That's probably for the reasons we just talked about. One, it didn't exist previously, and two, everyone was trying to not make substantive changes to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4712)|
| 1:18:42| So, that's probably why it appeared that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| So, if I remember correctly, the last public draft, which was draft five, that's when it comes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| And then you see the sign regulations in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| Basically, what you're doing is you're adopting the sign regulations from commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4736)|
| 1:19:04| That is not appropriate, and I'm going to go through why I think that's inappropriate here now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4744)|
| 1:19:12| And remember, I think the theme of tonight is all about maintaining balance, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| So, we talked about that before. I think we're going to talk about that in these next two as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| So, Article 8, Section 8.2a, it provides the purpose statement for the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4760)|
| 1:19:29| And it specifically says there, in part, that it exempts those operations that are industrial in nature, industrial in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4769)|
| 1:19:39| Further, if you look at the use matrix in Article 9, commercial uses such as retail goods establishment, eating and drinking establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4779)|
| 1:19:47| personal service establishments, gas stations, vehicle repair, as well as industrial uses are all not allowed in the institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4787)|
| 1:19:56| There's even separation in the articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| So, in the articles in the current zoning ordinance, the institutional district is in Article 8, which is for special purposes and overlays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4799)|
| 1:20:08| It's not in Article 5, which is for a commercial and office district, and it's not in 6, which is industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4808)|
| 1:20:16| So, if industrial and commercial uses aren't allowed, if they're found in different sections in articles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| why are we allowing industrial and commercial signs in an institutional district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4823)|
| 1:20:31| All of the locations, remember that all the locations that are currently institutional district were selected by planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| and many of those were previously zoned as residential or office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4838)|
| 1:20:43| So, it's really critical that we get this right when we consider that future rezonings could bring, I think, in an unintentional way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4843)|
| 1:20:53| things like an internally illuminated sign into a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| The moratoriums were important because of grandfathering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| If we don't get this right and somebody puts up a sign, then it's there almost forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| So, what I think we have to do here is address this issue of the institutional zone needs its own regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4871)|
| 1:21:26| that are not just getting it lumped in with these others that could very well be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| That's my objection to it as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4893)|
| 1:21:36| That's why I had suggested that we have the moratoriums and we work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| And I think we still have an opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| I'm glad we're having this workshop and an opportunity to discuss this today. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4905)|
| 1:21:54| Thank you, Councilman Roberto. I know you and I have talked a lot about this issue over the past months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4914)|
| 1:22:00| and appreciate the work of the planning staff, as well as folks at the city team, including Peter Aaron Brownberry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4920)|
| 1:22:09| and then also, of course, Christina McGrath, who really has looked into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| So, first of all, I want to recognize that the timeline did begin really back at the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4933)|
| 1:22:21| and we appreciate Council's attention to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| And to Amy's point, not only has planning looked at this, not only back in 2019, and again, in the very end of 2019, going into 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4943)|
| 1:22:36| but we recently, again, as part of a new administration and a new team here, have taken a fresh look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| and made sure that we're looking at this with fresh eyes to try to consider some of these considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| So, just wanted to kind of lend credence to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| And I'm hoping here that the technical folks who are really in the meat of this will pipe in as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| As Councilman Roberto alluded to, this is a new district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| One of the points that I think is important to kind of recognize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| so there are not only the underlying or the districts that it used to be prior to being industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| so it's the classification of the zoning district, but signs are also determined by the roadways adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| So, recognizing that there are differences depending on what type of road these properties that are zoned institutional would be along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=4997)|
| 1:23:28| So, it is important, again, to recognize the limits of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| We're talking about a relatively small number of parcels, and staff did identify all of those where frontage would be adjacent to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5013)|
| 1:23:43| for example, federally designated roadways, residentially zoned properties, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5023)|
| 1:23:49| So, there are, and I think some of you may have seen this memo in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5029)|
| 1:23:55| but there is data around where there might be potential conflicts for a residential adjacency that could trigger some of these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5035)|
| 1:24:07| Ultimately, they found that there's 16 properties that would have more than 5% of the applicable area being zoned residential next to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5047)|
| 1:24:19| and of those 16 properties, 15 of them are owned by entities such as the city, the county, or the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5059)|
| 1:24:29| where we would be exempt from local zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| So, again, just kind of narrowing the bandwidth of what we're looking at here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| So, there's a couple considerations, again, as we think about these institutional issues as being very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5077)|
| 1:24:45| and among the concerns that we have heard as we've listened to the Stakeholder Advisory Council and others is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5085)|
| 1:24:52| that ability for these institutional partners who may be hospitals, for example, they may be schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5092)|
| 1:24:59| you know, they're operating as a campus-like setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| and so they are not your commercial establishments that are looking to provide large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| what we call more commercially oriented science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| and so there's, again, the applicability of kind of who we're dealing with here and it being a very unique usage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| So, there's a lot here, and I think, you know, other folks will be better positioned to address specific questions as they come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5119)|
| 1:25:26| but, again, as we've looked at this with fresh eyes, you know, our assessment is that when we look at the particular parcels that this applies to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5126)|
| 1:25:36| and when we look at the appropriateness for those kind of campus-like settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| we do feel that the sign regulations that we're looking at are in scale with what we're addressing here as the types of properties that we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5142)|
| 1:25:55| So, I'm going to turn it over. I feel like I am not the technical expert on this by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| I've kind of been watching and trying to navigate it and understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| but I want to make sure that we give our technical folks an opportunity to chime in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| as well as address some of the specific points and questions that council has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| as you assess the issues that you've been hearing and dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5174)|
| 1:26:26| Okay. Have any other questions, comments, concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| Everybody obviously wants to speak up all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5193)|
| 1:26:44| Well, okay. I'll just say when we went through the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| there was a very clear, repetitive public statement. Can you guys hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| That there would be no changes to the signed ordinance through recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| So, this opens up for additional signs and, you know, that was something that was repeated over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5223)|
| 1:27:14| Councilman Wallace and Councilman Finbar and Stair, they had all been through the signed ordinance process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5234)|
| 1:27:22| and everybody was very committed to the idea. I mean, I don't want to put words in their mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5242)|
| 1:27:27| but it was very clear that we weren't changing the signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| and that's where I'm uncomfortable with the proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| because that doesn't honor what we said we were doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5255)|
| 1:27:43| So, if I could just chime in there. Thanks for that, Councilman Ryder. I remember that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5263)|
| 1:27:49| Unfortunately, because we've added new zones, regardless of the direction we go, there's a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5269)|
| 1:27:58| So, I think what the advisory committee are all saying is that the change that is made to the signed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5278)|
| 1:28:23| because of the change in the zones is appropriate. So, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| We said we weren't going to change the signed ordinance, but we are now saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5310)|
| 1:28:37| every month after recode has been adopted, that we heard council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5317)|
| 1:28:45| You expressed that concern. It has been reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| It has been reviewed in light of the fact that we have a new zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| It's been reviewed in light of the existing signed ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| and our recommendation to you is the recommendation that's before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5337)|
| 1:29:03| that's been considered multiple times, and I guess I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5343)|
| 1:29:13| I mean, we've been asked to review it, and that's what we're bringing back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5353)|
| 1:29:19| But no change is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5359)|
| 1:29:30| Lauren, you have something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5370)|
| 1:29:34| I'm pondering, and I have two dogs brawling behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| I think Ms. Brooks may be able to speak to the second issue if there's no other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5379)|
| 1:29:52| I was just going to make, Vice Mayor McKenzie, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| I was going to make kind of a little bit of a discussion there at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| I agree that we're talking about the point that was being made earlier about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| there's not that many of these that exist. That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5409)|
| 1:30:13| The problem isn't so much that we're not limited to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5413)|
| 1:30:18| How often have we seen a rezoning come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| So it's the issue about what are you going to do when you have a rezoning into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| I think the way I would look at it, and I understand that this has been asked to be reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| but I think what Council has been saying is we want another solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5433)|
| 1:30:40| We are troubled by these issues that don't mesh up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5440)|
| 1:30:46| Like we just went over. It's in the purpose statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| They're in different articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| They don't allow the same amount of time for the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| They're in different articles. They don't allow the same uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| Those things don't line up, and so we'd like to see a different solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| So what I would ask is that, and we haven't received this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5463)|
| 1:31:09| that we can have this as an option, and maybe that's what Council would pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| But we'd like to see a second option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| And what I would ask is that this get reviewed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| and I think there have been alternatives that have been sent in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5483)|
| 1:31:27| but haven't come back to Council to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| So my final question I think would be for my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| and that is do you like this as is based on the discussions we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| based on these discrepancies that exist, or would you like to see another option too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| And if you'd like to see another option, let's give some direction here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5507)|
| 1:31:51| so that we can get another option before we have to look at another moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5511)|
| 1:31:57| I don't want to see the moratoriums continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| I'd like to get a solution and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| But I'm uncomfortable with it as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| and I think there's been some other members who are uncomfortable with it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5526)|
| 1:32:11| Otherwise, we wouldn't be passing the moratoriums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| I want to make one small point of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| because I think you do bring up this important question of what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| were that owner to change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| And I think that goes again into the integrity of the institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| as being reserved for a very limited number of uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| And there is a possibility that someone could buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5551)|
| 1:32:35| what is currently an institutional parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| but they would not be permitted to use it for a commercial purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| without going through a full rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| which would of course come to you for decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| and whether that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| knowing then that the commercial sign would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| But simply a change in ownership would not open up that parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| to commercial development because of the inherent paradox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| of what happens in the institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| So I just want to make that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| It may not be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| Erin, I'm not laughing at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| It sounds like Councilwoman Ryder's dogs are fighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| You might want to give them a treat, Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Well, you guys missed my kid crying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| because he forgot to take his morning medicine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| Anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| 2022 is going to look really good, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| So some of the things that got into institutional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| I'm going to go back in here a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| but I just was perusing through the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| Like Covenant Hospital in the Fort Sanders area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| which does have some residential near it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| What was the zoning on that prior to recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| It's now institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| What was it before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| I would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| I think the point is, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| I'm sorry to pick singular examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| and maybe they need further assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| but I think that's the whole point is we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| we weren't going to change the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| that those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| office properties that are now institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| We're subject to the sign ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| that was agreed to for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| Office stays the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| but it's now equivalent to institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| And that's the sign regulations for institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| are now equivalent to commercial and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| So we didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| We kept our word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| We didn't change the zoning for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| We just took the things that were zoned office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| and made them something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| That's where my hang up is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| So that's my discomfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| I think I want to speak to this healthcare point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5714)|
| 1:35:17| specifically because this was something that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| stakeholder advisory council recognized with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| particular regard to hospital campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| And there were quite, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| and we were not allowing kind of public comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| during this workshop, but I think there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| folks who would welcome a chance to talk with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| council about their concerns for additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| restrictions on signage within these hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| And I think that was one that was raised in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| That was one that was raised as a place where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| you know, they, they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| they express concerns about the additional restriction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| So I'll offer that as something for further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| when you do have an opportunity to hear from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| members of our community who very specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| want to speak to that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| Meaning they didn't like the sign regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| that were put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| So I think that's a fair interpretation of what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| I think it was more the sense of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| when we heard the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| the articulation made that and I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| kind of two separate pathways here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| I think you're going out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| why not just revert back to what the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| restrictions were versus a argument that's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| made to, you know, carve out institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| and come up with unique standards specific to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| And I think that's where we heard some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| from members of the institutional community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| folks who would be subject to these regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| who did not want to go down that path and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| expressed concerns over some of the proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| that had been made that they would be far too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| restrictive for their needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| And I think that's something that's been brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| to city staff around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| Well, it could look like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| And I think those hypothetical what they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| look like for institutional standards specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| That was where some folks in our stakeholder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| advisory committee have some challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Like council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| if you get I'm still I'm not a black belt on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| land use yet or the specifics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5861)|
| 1:37:44| Councilperson Ryder and Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| what are some of the objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| of the institutional district sign requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5870)|
| 1:37:57| We haven't talked about the detailed objections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| to the sign requirements for that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| You all remember those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| or have some of those you can share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| Well, I think the internally illuminated signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| would be one, but I think the way to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5899)|
| 1:38:23| would be we're using the industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5903)|
| 1:38:31| and commercial standards in the institutional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5911)|
| 1:38:37| And is that appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| And what I was trying to walk us through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| was why I don't feel like it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| The uses are different, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| So if the uses are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| do the signs need to be different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| I mean, we're getting kind of caught up in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| hey, we said we weren't going to change the sign ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| which is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| And that was the whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| Well, we created a new zone and in doing so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| there's some changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| So what's the appropriate response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| It's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| What's the appropriate response?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| And what I would suggest is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| what we've got currently is not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| And it could end up with a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| that you are not going to want to drive by and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| oh, hey, I was a part of that going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| That was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| Because it's going to be in an inappropriate place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Your problem is not so much with what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| because planning staff did their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| and picked out these spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| that are going to be institutional for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5988)|
| 1:39:54| But it can change because this is a fluid system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5994)|
| 1:39:59| So somebody can ask for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=5999)|
| 1:40:01| And you got to remember that the required minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| is only 20,000 square feet for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| And so it is not so much that it's a small group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| of properties that could be affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| or impacted by this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| The reality is there's a lot of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| that could be affected by this in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| And that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| It's not so much the very few that exist today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| So I think the question is more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| what standard makes sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| Does the standard that we just went over make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| Or is there maybe a better approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| So I don't know if that really answers your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| Councilperson Smith, but I tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| If you don't mind, I will just say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| our understanding of what council asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6054)|
| 1:40:57| the moratorium to allow time to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| to determine if the standards are appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| for institutional zones, those commercial standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6064)|
| 1:41:08| It's been reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| It's been reviewed by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6069)|
| 1:41:10| It's been reviewed by planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| It's been reviewed by the stakeholder advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6072)|
| 1:41:15| in some cases, multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| And the opinion of the folks who were involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6078)|
| 1:41:23| in all of those reviews is that the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| that are in place are appropriate for institutional zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6087)|
| 1:41:31| And so if there is objection to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| then I think we would need very specific instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| as to why this group feels like those are not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| And then that will then have to be reviewed by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6101)|
| 1:41:46| planning commission, stakeholder advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6110)|
| 1:41:50| So I'm not objecting to your objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| I just, I think we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6113)|
| 1:41:55| I think we've asked folks to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| They've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| They've come back to you with a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| and I'm hearing that you're not satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| with that recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| but we would need to understand what is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| what exactly it is about the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| and the standards that you're not satisfied with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| I would suggest that what we do is indicate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| because we've got another topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| we need to move on to, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| But what I'd like from my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| this evening to do is to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6151)|
| 1:42:33| if we can ask for another option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6153)|
| 1:42:38| we have sent this back, it's been sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| I know there are other options out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| that have been sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| We'd be here for hours if we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| each of those line by line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| So the only thing I would ask is if you feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| you'd like to see another option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| than what's been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| then please let staff know that in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| so that maybe we can get a second option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| that we can look at and we can vote on two options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6189)|
| 1:43:14| instead of just looking at one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| which again, I think is inconsistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| with the spirit of what we were trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6197)|
| 1:43:23| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| Council Member Singh hasn't spoken all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| Oh, I can't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| We did it at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| so I'm just going to let her go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I was just going to put my opinion in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| that I think it is adequate the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| just with the limited applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| that an institutional zone could go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| If anyone wanted to do anything beyond that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| it would rezone and then those rules would kick in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| So I feel comfortable with the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| that were given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6239)|
| 1:44:05| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| I was just trying to get an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| This helps me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| An example of what type of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| that we think could then be rezoned to institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| that would make this an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6260)|
| 1:44:21| So are we talking about, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| an office building that might be a medical office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6264)|
| 1:44:30| in a suburban neighborhood or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| and then they want to change it to an outpatient clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| and become a hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| I'm just trying to get my head around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6280)|
| 1:44:42| what would convert to institutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6282)|
| 1:44:47| close to a residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6287)|
| 1:44:50| Again, I don't have my black belt in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6290)|
| 1:44:54| Like Councilman Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| So examples help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| I'm not as well versed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| So let me make one kind of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| because I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6305)|
| 1:45:05| so as you're thinking about those examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| the 20,000 square foot reference was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| and there is a designated minimum lot size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| of 20,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| but there's also, as we're thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6316)|
| 1:45:18| about our potential example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| the total area has to contain a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| of five contiguous acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| So that is quite significantly larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| I'm not very spatially gifted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| but I typed it into Google| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| and five acres is over 200,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| So we're talking about a much larger area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| than just the 20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6337)|
| 1:45:38| So again, Lynn, as you're thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6338)|
| 1:45:39| or Councilwoman Fuca,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6339)|
| 1:45:40| as you're thinking about that space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| you're thinking about not only just the parcel itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6343)|
| 1:45:45| being on the larger side of 20,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| but also then five contiguous acres collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| So it's a much larger square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| And yeah, I mean, I think one of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| so let me just kind of give you some examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| of what's out there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| Again, these are the places that do have the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| what we'd call the adjacency of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6363)|
| 1:46:08| Let me pull up my list here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| They include, so these are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6370)|
| 1:46:15| these are institutional properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| that would not be exempt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| So things that are not city, county, state, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| So Boys and Girls Club, Christian Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| the hospitals, Children's Hospital, Park West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Sport Sanders Regional, Knoxville College,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| Catholic High, so it's a lot of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| The Island Home Airport, for example, is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| South College is another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| The Knoxville Science Museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| on the former side of KPD headquarters would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| So those are examples of the types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| of institutional properties now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| that are not those, what I'd call exempt institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| like the utilities, the state, or city, county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| How's on the rider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6425)|
| 1:47:06| So there was an example that Ms. Gill just made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| and now it's floated right out of my brain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| One, but here's one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| so let me propose potentially one edit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| So an example, as Councilwoman Fugett asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| is St. Joseph's School on Cedar Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| is surrounded by residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6449)|
| 1:47:31| It was previously zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| Now it's zoned institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| It has signs, it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| but with the new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6459)|
| 1:47:41| with the new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6461)|
| 1:47:42| they could change and have illuminated signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| And then you're gonna have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| the Cranor-Kenny Rogers Roaster sign problem, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| So maybe a potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| one potential edit to it is if it is abutting residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6477)|
| 1:48:04| I may not have an option for you tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| but I think maybe there's a consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| for the sign standards are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| except if it's abutting a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| There was one that Ms. Gill mentioned a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| that also stood out to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| and I'm sorry, it left my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| as soon as she went on to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| But my concern is the areas that abut residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| and to include something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| where it cannot be internally illuminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| if it abuts residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| We did a lot of that in recode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| where this is the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| unless it's within X feet of residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| So that's what I'm thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| to modify it for institutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| That's helpful direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6532)|
| 1:48:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6534)|
| 1:49:03| Have any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6543)|
| 1:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6552)|
| 1:49:13| Council, are there any council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| that would like some additional follow-up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| If so, I'm sure that Ms. Gill, Amy, or Stephanie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6558)|
| 1:49:24| would be happy to maybe spend someone on one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6564)|
| 1:49:29| I hope that I'm not speaking out of term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6569)|
| 1:49:30| I know that you all would be more than willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6570)|
| 1:49:32| Maybe spend some individual time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| with some of our newer council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| that might have some additional questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| and you can maybe provide some examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6581)|
| 1:49:45| Yes, I am not very comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| with just this one option as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6587)|
| 1:49:49| It could possibly be the best option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6589)|
| 1:49:52| but I'm hearing some of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| that went through the entire recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| and they aren't very comfortable with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| And there are some things that kind of give me pause as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6599)|
| 1:50:03| So this is something I think we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| to take some more time on and try to get right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| If we need to send it back to the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| no offense to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| I'm sure they worked hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| But just the idea of maybe having another option or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| that we could discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| So those are my thoughts on it at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6622)|
| 1:50:26| Our observed workshop might have some issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6626)|
| 1:50:30| So I would urge caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| As my youngest counselor in the door behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| I'm not sure that it should be discussed tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6641)|
| 1:50:51| If it provides any assurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6651)|
| 1:50:56| we can, I mean, this will come back to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6656)|
| 1:51:00| I don't remember the date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| but it's in August and we can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| some additional background information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6665)|
| 1:51:10| through Mr. Johnson to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| And according to Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| this part would be a short discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| So I'm gonna take his word for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6678)|
| 1:51:21| Isn't that what you said, Councilman Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6681)|
| 1:51:23| I heard this part should be a short discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| My presentation won't be as long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6687)|
| 1:51:33| So, I mean, as with many council agenda items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| they're discussed in the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| So, I mean, that is an option, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6699)|
| 1:51:46| Well, I think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| Mr. Frost made it pretty clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| that we can't engage in a conversation on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| which I think is too bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| but I understand the rationale for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| And I know everyone was really waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| to listen to me talk about signs again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| So I apologize that we weren't able to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| but, you know, it'll come up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| So we'll have to address it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6739)|
| 1:52:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6746)|
| 1:52:27| So council members, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6747)|
| 1:52:29| please feel free to individually reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6749)|
| 1:52:31| to our resources on the call today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| to set up times if you need further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6754)|
| 1:52:36| or clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6756)|
| 1:52:38| And if there's no additional comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6758)|
| 1:52:43| questions or conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6763)|
| 1:52:45| if all hearts and minds are clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| we are going to call this meeting adjourned at 8.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6769)|
| 1:52:53| I hope everyone has a great evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| and a wonderful weekend if we don't talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Good night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-3877-200709?start=6779)|
