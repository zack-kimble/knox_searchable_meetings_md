| 0:01:00| Okay, we're going to go ahead and get started with our agenda committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=60)|
| 0:01:16| I do have already a few items that are to be added on top of what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=76)|
| 0:01:24| It's a resolution to amend the fiscal year 2010 budget and a continuation contract between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=84)|
| 0:01:40| the state of Tennessee and Knox County for IV-D child support reinforcement services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=100)|
| 0:01:49| And another resolution of commission will not tolerate any action or behavior that intimidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=109)|
| 0:01:58| insults, or threatens a citizen while exercising their right to appear before county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=118)|
| 0:02:07| That's brought by Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| The first one was juvenile court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| And there's an ordinance of chapter 26, article 4, vacant, deteriorated, or blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=131)|
| 0:02:22| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=142)|
| 0:02:24| There is a correction to item number 27 and it says to sell to Magnolia Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=144)|
| 0:02:35| It should be to the Park Ridge Community Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=155)|
| 0:02:43| And Ivan Harman has asked to be added to item 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=163)|
| 0:02:51| Are there any other items or changes to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| Yes, Mr. Saunders, and I hope I said that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=176)|
| 0:03:01| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Item 27, you changed to Park Ridge Community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| Does that also apply to 28 or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| No, they just accidentally put it down twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| They're two different addresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Oh, I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=197)|
| 0:03:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=198)|
| 0:03:19| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| I would like to be added to number 32 also, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| Oh, yes, I would as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Commissioner Broyles, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Actually, I did have a question for the law department about putting minutes online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=219)|
| 0:03:50| I can't remember what number that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=234)|
| 0:03:57| Number what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| Twenty-nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Twenty-nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| And that's great, but there were some other committees that I had in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| Should we just add this as an amendment during the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| You know, it's up to you however you want it to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=255)|
| 0:04:19| The reason we did it this way is these are the committees that the clerk's office takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| the minutes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| And when you're talking about putting minutes online, who's taking the minutes at some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=275)|
| 0:04:36| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| We don't know about their accuracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| We don't know if they're filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| These, we know that they're official minutes taken by the clerk's office, and they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=282)|
| 0:04:47| be, you know, depended on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Well, for example, I was thinking about the recent vehicle committee that's been meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| That's a committee that I'm not on, that I can't always attend, but I want to know what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=295)|
| 0:04:59| happening in that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| So I wanted those minutes posted so that we could read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| But there's not somebody from the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Do we need to invite someone from the clerk's office to come to meetings and take minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| if it's an official committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| Well, not necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| I mean, that would be something you'd need to take up with the clerk's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| I have received communication from the clerk's office that it's becoming very burdensome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| We're already wearing them out with the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Yeah, I was contacted by the clerk's office as well that if we continue to have more committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| that make additional committees, and the clerk's office is going to have to continue to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=340)|
| 0:05:46| the minutes for all of them, that they were going to have to add another employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=346)|
| 0:05:52| And Angie, who run the commission library and who attend commission meetings and take the minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| of course, they're in charge of, you know, they have all those in archive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| They have a computer search engine to be able to research ordinances and resolutions going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| back for a certain period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Then they have to do it by hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| But since September, they have taken on the responsibility for attending and taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| minutes at the ethics committee, the audit committee, and, you know, they meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=381)|
| 0:06:30| Those different committees meet at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| So...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=395)|
| 0:06:37| And I appreciate what they're doing, because like I said, I want information available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| for commissioners who can't be at committee meetings, but also for our citizens who are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| interested in following, you know, having the minutes posted online also increases the transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Can we not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| I mean, already because of the expanded regulations having to do with the Open Meetings Act, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| we're having to take notes ourselves of meetings, could not a commissioner be appointed in each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| of those committee meetings to take official minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=427)|
| 0:07:10| There's no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| That's, in fact...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Are you volunteering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| Well, you know, for the meetings that I'm at, I'm happy to take notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| I normally do just so that I have something to refer to myself, but I'm not going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| in all these meetings, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| It's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| What I'm going to suggest, it's up to the various committees to, you know, assign a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=447)|
| 0:07:38| member, unless it's one of these that's specifically referenced in here that the clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| already does the minutes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Can you write me up an amendment that adds that, that the committees need to appoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=466)|
| 0:07:55| someone to take official minutes and that they need to be posted online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| If...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=480)|
| 0:08:01| I'll be happy to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=481)|
| 0:08:03| What I'd like is for you to tell me which committees...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| I think it's important that we are specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| So if you'll tell me which committees that you want that inserted in, we can easily make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Somebody keeps pushing my mute button over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Well, how much...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| So how...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| It may be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| It may be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| I wish she had one sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=511)|
| 0:08:35| Well, like the Vehicles Committee, any committee that's dealing with an issue that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| to, or a committee that's going to make recommendations to the commission, would that be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=521)|
| 0:08:49| I can draft it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| So it'll read any commission, any committee that is going to make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=532)|
| 0:08:59| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| And I think we should make that prospective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Now, is that going to be an item that's to be added, or is that just going to be an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| to what we already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| How about I just throw it out as an amendment at the committee meetings next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=553)|
| 0:09:18| If you wish to do that, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| I just had, as we talk about adding...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| I'm not saying that we're talking about adding staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| Let me correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| But as we talk about the potential to add a staff member, we...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| By the time you count fringes and benefits, are we still looking at about 100K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Is that a general number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| For an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| For an employee, or more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I think that would be substantially high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| I mean, I don't know what the salary would be, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| Well, about health insurance, fringes, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| I doubt that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| John, Troyer, to me, that sounds quite high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=594)|
| 0:10:00| I would probably think, I think, half that, depending on what the salary is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| I think it might be wise to ask the clerk and see if he could maybe accommodate within his existing staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| and we could start there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| He's not ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| He's trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| He's just saying that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| Come to us and said that they can't take on anything new without adding additional personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| Because they've had, you know, additional things put on them over the past several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| that the clerk's office had never done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| We've added committees, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| They're spending late nights here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=639)|

| 0:10:41| The minutes are longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| That, and they're having to cover more committees, and task force, and things to that nature that we've added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| I'll volunteer to meet with the clerk and go over what the expectations might be or the needs might be, and then we can have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| I mean, I don't foresee us adding any new committees, but you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| I mean, that's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| There's 19 of us, and so when they come up with a very good idea, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| I mean, you know, I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| As we talk about adding duties, I just want to make sure we're looking at the financial implications of these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=669)|
| 0:11:16| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| I want to have a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| I just think before we start adding too many additional committees, task force, that we think of the implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=679)|
| 0:11:28| that it may require staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| Well, or it may just require one of us taking really good notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| I mean, really, guys, how hard is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Well, that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| You may take meticulous notes, whereas I'm sketchy and I'm hitting a high point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| So, then you get into what's the standard of a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| That's why it's really good to have the clerk's office do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| That's what the expertise they bring, and, you know, we've got 19 of us that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| They archive it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| They can put it online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| If anybody ever has a question, they're the ones that can, you know, research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=719)|
| 0:12:05| They're not coming to all of the, you know, the meetings that we have in our districts with constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| that we have to keep minutes of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| But it's a good thing for us to discuss as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| So, if you'll bring that up at the committees, that'd be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| John, do you have anything that you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Item 19, on behalf of the HR department, we'd like to withdraw that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Item 19 will be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| Grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Withdrawal number 5, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Withdrawal number 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| Is there any reason why we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| We just don't need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=770)|
| 0:12:51| Still, the law department's working out some kinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| Some kinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Might be something that we'll see next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Is there anything else that wants to come before this body?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| If not, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090408agendameeting?start=787)|
