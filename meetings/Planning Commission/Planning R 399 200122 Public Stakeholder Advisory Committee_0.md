| 0:00:30| Good morning, and welcome to the January meeting of the Public Stakeholder Advisory Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=30)|
| 0:00:39| I'd like to thank all the committee members for volunteering their time and their knowledge to this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=39)|
| 0:00:45| I think most of the members of the public are probably aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=45)|
| 0:00:49| the ones here are aware of the role of the Public Stakeholder Advisory Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=49)|
| 0:00:53| but since this is taped, I'll quickly go over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=53)|
| 0:00:56| The Public Stakeholder Advisory Committee was initially formed to guide and provide input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=56)|
| 0:01:03| into the development of the city's new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| Upon the passage of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| the city council directed that the Public Stakeholder Advisory Committee remain active for another two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=68)|
| 0:01:15| to review the implementation of the new zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=75)|
| 0:01:20| to review issues and concerns, to identify amendments that needed to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=80)|
| 0:01:28| So you'll continue meeting every two months for the next year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=88)|
| 0:01:34| And I have to put this in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| I won't be with you after your June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| Personally, I'm very pleased about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=103)|

| 0:03:23| Just as a note, seeing what Don and Brian did, if you lean up and you press the black button that's right in front of you on the lip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=203)|
| 0:03:34| it turns off the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Thanks for the secret conversations that we have to support the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| I hope most of you realize that I have a great sense of humor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| I'm a bit cynical after all these years in this profession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| but I still have a sense of humor which has enabled me to get through the last five-plus years, the last 35, actually, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=229)|
| 0:03:59| Again, thanks, and we'll wait until Caroline comes up and lets her introduce herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| I think there's a seat, Caroline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=245)|
| 0:04:18| If you could introduce yourself, Caroline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| Again, thanks to all of you for taking the time to meet this morning and to consider the issues before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=264)|
| 0:04:34| I think we may have a pretty quick meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| I think, and this will surprise community forum and get Larry's attention there, but this will get his attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=279)|
| 0:04:46| But Larry, on behalf of community forum, sent out some information, and maybe I agree with Larry's points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| or he agrees with mine, one or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| but I think that's the only comment we've had from the public on the issues coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| As we go through these, I'd like to hear more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Just some updates and announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| First of all, a couple of the issues that we addressed at our last meeting in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| one, the bus parking, amending the standards for bus parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| that will go before the Planning Commission at their February meeting on February 13th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| and then on to City Council, taking the input provided by this committee and the drafting of that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| So we'll make parking of buses at churches and schools and residential districts legal for the first time in probably at least 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=332)|
| 0:05:43| We'll address a few other things that were identified by this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| On the hillside protection overlay, we're reviewing that, continue to review the wording to make sure it's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| We may have some clarification amendments at the March Planning Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| We're also looking at the mapping to see one of the questions is how do we address previously graded areas where some old map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=359)|
| 0:06:08| a topo map may have had it as a slope, but it's been previously graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| We're trying to see how we can adjust our hillside overlay to recognize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=372)|
| 0:06:20| We're not certain we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| That may be something that's in the hillside overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=382)|
| 0:06:25| During that initial review of the project, we identified it as a previously graded area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=385)|
| 0:06:30| but we're trying to come back to you with updates on that as our GIS staff has more time to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=390)|
| 0:06:37| A couple of other things, just general announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| The meeting with various groups to review the user's manual met yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| and thanks to Amy and Jennifer for arranging the meeting with CAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| That was a great turnout and good meeting at lunch yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=409)|
| 0:06:52| And then last evening, I met with the League of Women Voters and thanked Mary for helping to arrange that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| and went over the user's manual and just general discussion at both those meetings about the new zoning code and how it applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| Pull up a chair in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=426)|
| 0:07:13| Here's a chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=433)|
| 0:07:24| I guess we're a popular group, so we're getting you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| Any other, just other general things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| So far we've had no issues with the new zoning ordinance that would cause any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| I have met with a couple of people interested in pursuing the plan development approval process for some unique projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| and I think that will prove an avenue that will work well for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| It enables uses of property without a change in the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And one of those properties is an old school that is in a residential district where the community does not want rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=476)|
| 0:08:03| but limiting the use of the school to the single-family residential is not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| And so this provides an avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| And the owner and his representative seem excited about the plan development approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| and they have met with the neighborhood, and the neighborhood seems excited about it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| I think that will prove a good tool for our use as we try to inspire that creativity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=502)|
| 0:08:27| and allow the Planning Commission and the City Council some flexibility in approval of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| Peter, do you have any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| Nothing major.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| It's going pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| There's some oddities that pop up here and there, but nothing that we can't overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| And Kristina, do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=529)|
| 0:08:51| No, I think through this process and a couple of housekeeping amendments that may be proposed here soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=531)|
| 0:09:00| I think overall it's going pretty well so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| And we do have some minor amendments that will go to the Planning Commission in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| or already went to the Planning Commission and first reviewed by the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| It will be next week, just minor wording amendments, clarifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| some edits that were not caught in the many reviews of the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| That will take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| One item that will be on your agenda for your March meeting is dealing with nonconformities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| It's in Section 17 of the Zoning Ordinance, I believe 17-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=570)|
| 0:09:38| And I forgot the approval minutes, so we'll go back after I finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| During one of the last sessions of City Council in review of the new Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=583)|
| 0:09:48| there was a motion made and it was approved to take out the nonconforming section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| that Kristina and our consultants and other staff had worked on countless hours to address the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| 21st century, in a 21st century way, nonconforming lot structures, land, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| We've taken that old nonconforming section from 1960 and it misses a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| There are a number of things that are not addressed that we're having to sort of wing it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=616)|
| 0:10:22| So we'll be coming to you with ideas on how to adjust the nonconforming section to address those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| which are a concern and are 21st century items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| That will be the big task for your next meeting in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| If there are no questions, we'll now go backwards and ask for approval of the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=638)|
| 0:10:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| A motion by Amy and a second by Sam to approve the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| If not, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Minutes are approved. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=659)|
| 0:11:01| On to the next item, which is a discussion of the past three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=661)|
| 0:11:06| which is the review of provision for outdoor storage in the C6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Some key elements here, just as background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| the outdoor storage was not identified as a permitted use or special use in the general commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=675)|
| 0:11:26| Initially, at the request of a commercial developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| the request was to add it as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| The staff felt that as a permitted use it was certainly not appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| that maybe as a special use it might be appropriate and proposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=698)|
| 0:11:41| There are some concerns about the outdoor storage and storage yards in the general commercial district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=701)|
| 0:11:50| because they can be larger than the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| They can overwhelm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Keeping in mind that the general commercial zone is identified as a more pedestrian-friendly zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| It's along those corridors like Kingston Pike, Central, Magnolia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=722)|
| 0:12:09| Broadway is a radiate out from downtown and it is designed to enhance the pedestrian experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| to be a more dense area, more interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=735)|
| 0:12:19| The concern is that large storage yards that could be larger than the principal structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=739)|
| 0:12:26| would not enhance that pedestrian area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| and would take a lot of property that may better be used for the more intense type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| that is envisioned by the general commercial zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| Since this has gone out, I've heard no comments from the development community about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| It appears that the provision of outdoor storage as accessory uses could meet the need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=764)|
| 0:12:55| The one concern that I had was some businesses that seemed to have large outdoor storage areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| and one in particular was Mayo Garden Center on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| I looked at the aerial photos of that and their storage area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| even though it seems large, is smaller than their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| So they meet the provision for outdoor sales and storage as an accessory use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| That's my overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| At this point, I don't foresee a need for outdoor storage yards as a secondary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| even under special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| If the issue comes to light and there is a request for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| then it can be brought back to this committee to review this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| But again, at this point, I've received no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=825)|
| 0:13:48| In the review I've done in our MAP general commercial district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| there is no business that has an outdoor storage area that's larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| or that I can find that is larger than the principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| I think Brian was first and then Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Is there a distinction between storage and display?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| I wouldn't consider Mayo storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=846)|
| 0:14:08| I'd consider that display where you're actually selling things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| It's outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| There is a distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| It's in the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=855)|
| 0:14:18| An outdoor display and sales area is a part of a lot used for outdoor sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=858)|
| 0:14:24| and or display of goods accessory to the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| And that accessory is key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| That means that the area used for that has to be smaller than the principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| And then the definition of outdoor storage, parentheses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| accessory is keeping a property accessory to the principal use in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=877)|
| 0:14:42| outside of any principal or accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Both these are permitted in the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| The key is that whether it's sales and display or storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| that area is accessory to the principal structure or principal use and is smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| So Mayo complies with that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| Jennifer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So when you see a couple things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=906)|
| 0:15:09| but you said you don't see secondary use of outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=909)|
| 0:15:14| It doesn't need to be a special use in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| Were you saying it doesn't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=917)|
| 0:15:19| I don't see the need for it as a special use or as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| So in the principal use table in Table 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=926)|
| 0:15:31| It's shown as a special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| It's shown storage yard outdoor secondary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| That would be not a principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| That would be secondary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| That would be like Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| And the definition, the way that it's defined now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| even as a secondary use is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| Hold on a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| I'll find the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| It's defined as an outdoor storage yard containing materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| and or equipment that serves another principal use on the same lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| The storage yard outdoor secondary use may be larger than the principal use it serves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| And that, I think, is the challenge that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| that we want in the general commercial zoning district storage yards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| that are larger than the principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| So I was looking at the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| So in the definitions, outdoor display and sales area and outdoor storage, both accessory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| take care of what we currently see in CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| So we do not need storage yard outdoor secondary, which is what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| as any type of use in CG so far as you're concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Staff saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I had to get my, make sure we all understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1004)|
| 0:16:47| and I understood which definitions we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| After 40 years of doing this, sometimes my mind gets rattled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| And I think I know what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| With an emphasis on think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I think it's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| I think Mary was next and then, or was Dwayne next and then Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| I was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Oh, she said she was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Ladies first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| I have a concern about this in that, in switching to permitted from special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| We're not going to permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1037)|
| 0:17:18| What I'm saying, and again, going to Jennifer's comment, is that it's prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| It would be prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Oh, just prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Prohibited in the general commercial district with the provision that allows outdoor sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1045)|
| 0:17:37| and display as an accessory use and outdoor storage as an accessory use in the general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| Well, let me, I'm a little confused obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| But let me bring up the example of Mayo's, which you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1068)|
| 0:17:54| The site there, outdoor storage, includes both the display in the front and storage in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1074)|
| 0:18:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1082)|
| 0:18:04| And because of the unique nature of each business and what they're planning to display| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1084)|
| 0:18:13| and for how long and also whether they are otherwise storing material,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1093)|
| 0:18:21| I wonder whether it should be allowed but as a special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| so that the layout could be examined, considered by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| And again, Mayo, in reviewing the aerial photos and calculating the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| their outdoor display sales storage area in total is smaller than their principal building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| So they meet the current standard of those as an accessory to the principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| And so they would be, even if the outdoor storage yard as a secondary use is prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1135)|
| 0:19:01| Mayo would still be compliant with the code because their outdoor sales display storage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| in total is smaller in area than their principal structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| So what you're saying is that if it's smaller, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| And if it's larger, it's prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| And again, keeping in mind that the goal of the CG zoning district is to provide an area that in five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1161)|
| 0:19:30| 10 years is an enhanced pedestrian realm where you and I would feel comfortable walking past these stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1170)|
| 0:19:38| and the large storage area that may be in front of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| is that something that is conducive to the goal of the zoning district or purpose of the zoning district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| I'm joining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Yeah, I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1194)|
| 0:19:55| So question number two, is there a need for outdoor storage area which can be larger than the principal building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| as a secondary use in the CG district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| You're saying no to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| I can't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| And that's going up and down most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| You're recommending no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| You're recommending no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| I'm recommending no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| Any other questions or comments on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| Just to be clear, we can do outdoor display and sales and outdoor storage area accessory to the main principal use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1217)|
| 0:20:24| We don't need that in the principal use chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| So that's still there for anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| I'll look to Peter to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| It's a true statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| Well, no, there's a difference between outdoor sales and display versus outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| The stuff you find in the back of Home Depot, I would consider storage where they've just got their lumber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| But their plant life and wares that they have out front would be display and sales because that's what people are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1245)|
| 0:20:53| and looking at and purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| When I go into Article 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| I just want to be clear that we're allowing businesses to have, you know, to store normal things on site and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| Like, we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| You can't store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| That's limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| It is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Yes, we are limiting it to what the business, you know, needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Outdoor sales and display is across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Outdoor storage is limited and does not include retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| Does not include retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1282)|
| 0:21:26| So that if you're in 10.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1286)|
| 0:21:38| Sorry, I'm scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| 10.3V, which is on page 10-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| Outdoor storage that's accessory is limited to those that are in Part V1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1305)|
| 0:21:56| That's where it gets a little confusing because you're looking in that code text to find the principal uses that allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| secondary outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Permitted in a limited fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Appropriate for the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| Mary, your light's still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| I would like to have a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1340)|
| 0:22:23| What I would say the vote would be to eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| Let me get the term correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| Outdoor storage yard, outdoor secondary use in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1351)|
| 0:22:39| Do you need a motion first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| So how do we deal with the Home Depots and Lowe's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| They're in the CH.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| And, again, something that large is, and good question, is more intense than the CG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1376)|
| 0:23:03| And so they're designated CH or CR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| I think there's one that's a CR, a regional commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| Where it is the storage yard, outdoor secondary use is a permitted use, not even a special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1389)|
| 0:23:18| It's just permitted without review by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| We're trying to make the uses appropriate and go up in that level of intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1418)|
| 0:23:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1419)|
| 0:23:40| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| I noticed no one said, everyone said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| See, I'm very observant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Got to get it for the record, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| I have to, once again, thank Christina for keeping me somewhat calm during the many hours of meetings before City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1436)|
| 0:24:06| If she thought that job was tough, just her job over the next five and a half months is going to be much tougher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1446)|
| 0:24:13| I accept your challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| The next one is our next task is the review of temporary outdoor sales provision, again, in the CG zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1458)|
| 0:24:31| Again, I think I agree with the community forum on this, or they agree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| I see temporary outdoor sales are closely regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| There are standards and so forth in the report I prepared for you for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| They have to obtain a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| The limitations on the duration of the outdoor sales event, typically five days, except that pumpkin patches and Christmas tree sales can go for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1490)|
| 0:24:59| Four events, I think it's better not trust my memory, are four events per calendar year on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1499)|
| 0:25:10| And this is not the applicant, but the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| So four events per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1514)|
| 0:25:15| They have to provide plans of where tables are going to be set up at their tables and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| And, again, that permit has to be for the temporary outdoor sales, has to be approved by the zoning administrator who can approve it, deny it, or attach conditions to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1520)|
| 0:25:33| I think one of the reasons we allow temporary outdoor sales is there are churches and schools, not too many schools, but some churches own general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1533)|
| 0:25:44| They often have pumpkin patch or fundraising outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Business may want to have a sidewalk sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| Entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs who may have some business that's out of their home may need a place to sell their items or show their crafts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1552)|
| 0:26:03| Temporary outdoor sales in this district is the appropriate place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| Again, we're trying to create a more pedestrian-friendly environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| Those outdoor sales can be very pedestrian-friendly, I think, for a number of reasons that it is appropriate to have the temporary outdoor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1571)|
| 0:26:20| And the general commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| With that, I'll finish my comments and look for comments or questions from the committee if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| The recommendation from staff is to leave the provision as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| We feel that the standards for temporary outdoor sales are appropriate and that they are appropriate in the CG zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1595)|
| 0:26:46| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1606)|
| 0:26:51| Yes, Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Gerald, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| There's a place on Kingston Pike, it's an antique shop that I know when I was on council we turned in a number of times that keep putting all their wares outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| How does that tie into what we're doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Are they going to be allowed to continue to do that or what do you consider that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| It's certainly not a temporary thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| That's outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1631)|
| 0:27:12| Outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| Okay, but I mean, the stuff they're putting out there is stuff they regularly sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| So, I mean, how do you deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Are they going to be able to continue to do that with recode?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| Yes, the temporary outdoor sales and display would be permitted subject to the provisions in Article 10 on page 1011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1648)|
| 0:27:43| Yes, 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| Materials located adjacent to the storefront, not within five feet of a door, active door within 15 feet directly in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1673)|
| 0:28:01| Clear width for the pedestrian traffic of five feet is maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| There's some standards, but they can keep putting it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| As outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| Outdoor sales and display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| Which is a separate issue than the temporary sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Sales, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| My question came from the Neighborhood Association Advisory Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| If a community association or a church association has an event that is mostly free, like music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1713)|
| 0:28:43| and some food trucks or maybe, you know, somebody selling Popsicles or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1723)|
| 0:28:50| they want to know what constitutes a sales event versus just a free company, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1730)|
| 0:29:02| Like a special event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Right, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| A special event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| I mean, if they wanted to do an evening of music and it's all free, but there's a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1746)|
| 0:29:13| The food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Food trucks or maybe somebody selling jewelry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| What's the definition between that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| That's a tough question, so I'm going to let Peter answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| I was tracking down something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Reframe this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| There's something going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| There's something going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| The community is trying to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| The association is trying to reach out to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| And so they're having a free concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| They've scheduled a series of free concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| In a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Near their church or wherever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| But they want to know what constitutes a sales event rather than if they're having music| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1790)|
| 0:30:02| and there's some food trucks and maybe somebody selling jewelry, you know, one or two kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| What is the cutoff to becoming a sales event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| Definition of what a sales event constitutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| There is a definition of a temporary outdoor sales event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| And there's also temporary outdoor entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| Outdoor entertainment, both on 224.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| There is an actual doggie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1835)|
| 0:30:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1844)|
| 0:30:45| I downloaded this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1846)|
| 0:30:47| This is just the user's room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1847)|
| 0:30:49| Yeah, you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| Yeah, that's not going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| I think one thing that your question really points out is how fact-intensive each one of those temporary events will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| And, you know, that's definitely something where we would look to those definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| You know, temporary outdoor entertainment, temporary outdoor sales, short-term, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| So that'll really help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Yeah, you'll bring your proposal in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| And we'll just have to figure out where it fits, whether the intent is to, you know, sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| But each event has to have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| For the both of those, the standards are on page 930 and go over to 931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| For temporary outdoor entertainment, it's on 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Temporary outdoor sales is 931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1912)|
| 0:32:02| I shouldn't say go ahead and do it and see if anyone reports you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| That's what I just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| If it's small enough, maybe, and quick enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| Yes, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Oh, wait a minute, Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Just now, as we're referring to this temporary sales permit, this is only for persons in CG, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1936)|
| 0:32:26| They're allowed throughout in all zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| And I would look to Peter on this, but I think if you had a yard sale or a garage sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1950)|
| 0:32:38| likely you wouldn't get a permit, but if you started having a garage sale and a yard sale every weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1958)|
| 0:32:45| your neighbors may get tired of the traffic and may report you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| Yes, and garage sales or yard sales are regulated by the tax office, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| Which office are they regulated by?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| Business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Business office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| License and tax office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| They're regulated outside the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| And you're limited to a certain number of yard sales per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Brian and then Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| I guess I just have a general comment about the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| So we're being asked to consider something that's existing in the code, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=1993)|
| 0:33:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| And I guess my question is why are we being asked to consider it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| If somebody has brought up a point to reconsider how this is written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| then I think it's important that that person comes and makes the counterpoint to why we're being asked to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2012)|
| 0:33:40| Because I don't, like if somebody, like the last issue we discussed was a developer requested some language to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2020)|
| 0:33:49| Well, then somebody needs to come here, I think, and say why they're asking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| And so we understand that point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| And then what we would do is go and consider that argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| And then what our vote really is is making a recommendation to the planning commission, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2045)|
| 0:34:06| So nobody's sitting here saying questions for the committee to consider, but why are we considering them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2046)|
| 0:34:15| So if somebody doesn't see this language as sufficient, then I kind of want to know what their point of view is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| And I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| And the only answer I can give is these were identified by City Council, the task before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2064)|
| 0:34:29| And City Council said review, have the stakeholder committee review these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| And some of their reasoning, a lot of their reasoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| were there were concerns expressed by members of the public during the Council's review of these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| Then I think that if that's the case, then whoever led the discussion at City Council needs to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| this group and say, here's why I think you need to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Because I'm sitting here going, what are we discussing here, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| Like, what do you want us to change about this language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| And the next one, when we get into the nonconforming piece, that will be brought by staff, so we'll explain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| But the next, in June, there will likely be some other issues that were identified by City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| So I'll reach out to Council members and ask them to come and defend their reason for putting those items on the list of issues to be addressed by the stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2122)|
| 0:35:32| I think that's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Because, to be honest, I can recollect some of the conversation, but I don't know why these issues rose to the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2134)|
| 0:35:43| I just feel like I'm in a funny word problem here that we're trying to decipher what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| Welcome to my world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Now you know why I'm smiling when I can count down the days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| I don't have to deal with word problems anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| I think my confusion, anyway, is partly increased by the handout where it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2160)|
| 0:36:09| Task for Review Temporary Outdoor Sales Provision in CG District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| And actually, what you just said is that the Temporary Outdoor Sales Provision is, you know, when you go down, there's talk of residential districts and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2176)|
| 0:36:28| So this task, the way it's worded, is confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| It also says that it identifies outdoor sales as a temporary use in the CG district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2196)|
| 0:36:47| but presumably it's identified as an outdoor sales could occur as a temporary use in other districts as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2207)|
| 0:36:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| And this is what City Council asked this committee to review, the provision in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| the current provision for temporary outdoor sales only in the CG district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| And going back to Brian's point, I'm not sure why they selected this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| There were some concerns identified by members of the community that temporary outdoor sales in the CG district would be the downfall of civilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2234)|
| 0:37:24| as if issues, well, I started to make a political comment, but I'm not going to, a national political comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| I think we have bigger concerns that may cause a downfall of civilization than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2252)|
| 0:37:40| But I'll stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Yes, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| So as the person representing City Council, I do remember vaguely the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| and I think what it came down to is we were sort of getting stuck on an issue that I don't honestly even remember exactly what the concerns were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2272)|
| 0:38:01| But it was just a sticking point, and it was like, okay, in order for us to move on, let's defer this to the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2281)|
| 0:38:12| Unfortunately for Gerald and for all of the planning staff and city staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| I would say there wasn't a lot of direction for exactly what council wanted back on this particular item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| And that would be true of several of the items that are coming to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| And I'm not trying to criticize anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| It just got to the point where it was like, okay, we're stuck, send this to the stakeholder committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| And to reinforce what Stephanie or Council Member Welch said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| that there were issues that the City Council seemed to just want some thinking about some different perspectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2320)|
| 0:38:49| and especially a bit more time that could be spent in a discussion that often dragging late into the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2329)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| And just stand back for a bit and take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| And are the provisions appropriate to defend council when they were trying to look through a number of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2346)|
| 0:39:14| and some of them very critical to the community, and some needed just to have some different perspectives on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| So the main question is whether 9.4 is suitable for the CG district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| or whether it should have its own special provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| Or be eliminated as temporary outdoor sales should they not be permitted in the CG district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| or should additional standards be placed on temporary outdoor sales in the CG district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2380)|
| 0:39:46| And again, staff's opinion is that the standards that are in place now are appropriate to guide temporary outdoor sales in the CG district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2386)|
| 0:39:56| I think Jennifer is next, and then Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| So on that, the staff thinking that they are appropriate, can we look at some of those, the time limitations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2400)|
| 0:40:09| Can you go over what's changed or why residential was limited to three, non-residential four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| and the calendar days that it was limited to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| Are those the same or extremely different than what we had in the old code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2420)|
| 0:40:26| I'll let Peter answer that because I was able to not learn the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2426)|
| 0:40:35| Unfortunately, I didn't bring my old code with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| Honestly, we didn't get a whole lot of requests for these temporary sales at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2438)|
| 0:40:48| I'll text somebody to bring my old code down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| It's not online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| And the baseline for these, and I know we adjusted them somewhat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| was that our consultants looked at national standards and looked at what was common in other communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| and felt that by limiting the number of sales, the duration of sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| we're not imposing in residential districts on the neighborhood itself or in commercial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| You know, if every weekend my business has temporary outdoor sales in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2477)|
| 0:41:23| and your business is in the same little center or same area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| your customers don't have enough parking or don't want to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| because the crowd at my, hopefully, where is it so good that there's a crowd at my temporary outdoor sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| that it starts inhibiting your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| We want it to balance those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| I'll be, I guess, political for a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| because I think some of the concerns that Councilwoman Welch had said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| from the community and things like that is that the sky may fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| and that there may be temporary outdoor sales one weekend and temporary entertainment the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2515)|
| 0:42:00| and some permit for something else the next and there may be something temporary all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| And so, but I think that's more of a complex issue than we can handle and take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2524)|
| 0:42:09| and what the resources we have today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| So I would agree that, I don't know if that was a legitimate concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2531)|
| 0:42:18| or if it was, you know, a fear that was not based in what could actually happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| So I would recommend just to keep it the way it is at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Let me get a couple more comments and I'll come back to you for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| But I think what we can do is continue to monitor the temporary outdoor sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| and if there are issues or problems, we'll bring them to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| and if they're after your term limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| then we as staff can address them working with the City Council and the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2565)|
| 0:42:50| Just real quick, Gerald, before you move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| Jennifer, I wanted to address your point on the older code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| We did change the standards for these and if my memory serves correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| I think the concern was from neighborhoods being able to basically through the temporary uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2582)|
| 0:43:09| have constant outdoor activities going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| Now whether or not that's, you know, something that happens often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| I don't think we get those requests, but I think that was where the concern originated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2596)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Well, certainly there are exceptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| and so you could have a rule that forms through just continual use like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| I think you could address that in a change in the ordinance at the time if you saw the abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| But it seems to me that most of this is built around fostering pedestrian experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| That's exactly what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| You know, temporary sales are supposed to bring people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| and hopefully they're walking down the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| It's outside a neighborhood, so it's in general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| So I'm prepared to second the motion or make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Any other comments before I ask Jennifer to make a motion and Joe to second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2640)|
| 0:44:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Jennifer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| I make a motion that this body recommends the city council to keep the regulations as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| as that's currently stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| And with that, we'll go to the next item, which is other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2664)|
| 0:44:30| I don't really have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| I'll go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Dwayne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| This is a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Were we supposed to vote on those other items, on those other questions that you had under each one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2676)|
| 0:44:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| They're all encompassed in the overall motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| I just wanted to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| One thing that has come up in several of our housing committee meetings at the NAACP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2688)|
| 0:44:54| there is a concern of how this body defines family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2694)|
| 0:44:59| So if we possibly could think on that, maybe working on that through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| if there is already an official definition of how a Knox,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| Knox County planning or the city of Knoxville defines family, if we could share that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| If not, I would like to, from the constituency that I represent, we would like to see that defined in black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2716)|
| 0:45:24| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| I know there, and Christina and I were talking, and I know there was a lot of discussion about the definition of family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| and whether it was appropriate for a zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I can't remember where we landed on that, but we'll review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| And Christina may have something to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| I know it's not in the, I don't think it's in the definition section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| I think we may have put it back in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Retrieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| No, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| I think it is back in somewhere in the administrative provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2751)|
| 0:45:57| Because that's my recollection that I just, because I just put my head in my hands when city council defined family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2757)|
| 0:46:07| Let me just jump in here real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Was your concern about the Article 4 discussion with functional families and things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| Well, just the question that was given to me is how are we defining family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| And I just want to be able to point them in the direction where they can find that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| And if we do not have one, if we could make sure that we work on one that is inclusive and represents equity for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| So I definitely hear the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| The issue from a legal perspective, though, is that we don't want to run afoul of the Federal Fair Housing Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| or the State Human Rights Act and how we define it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| You know, family might be blood related, related by marriage, by adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| You know, we have nontraditional families where a grandmother might be taking care of her grandchildren, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| So, you know, it's one of those situations where it's almost impossible to fully nail down a good definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2813)|
| 0:46:59| that also wouldn't run afoul of the Fair Housing and State Human Rights Act boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| However, you know, that is a discussion that we can continue to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| And I'd like to, I guess, maybe get a little bit more detailed feedback on what that might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| And we can certainly have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| I was just going to say that I know on council for eight years we discussed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| and we ran into a lot of legal problems in terms of trying to define family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| And that's not to say we still can't have the discussion, but we spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| In fact, there was even a couple of committees that got together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| There should be some historical information on that in terms of what a family is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| But it boiled down to the fact that it began to get into a legal situation, just like what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| And that's, Samuel, if you look at page 4-2, under the residential occupancy standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| that is where our current council had a lot of discussion about the functional family definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| And in lieu of those, what we ultimately decided was to make it based on square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| instead of, you know, this person counts as a family member and this person doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| And HUD has issued guidance on that as far as whether or not that's enforceable under the Fair Housing and Human Rights Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2887)|
| 0:48:15| And generally, the answer from HUD is that generally the square footage requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| based on the occupancy limits, is just prima facie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| It's going to survive a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| Amy and then Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| I didn't mean to turn me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Oh, okay. Then Peter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| I do remember the long conversations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| And we got away from identifying people by family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| and decided to rely on the property maintenance code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| and regulating it based on health, safety, and welfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| irregardless of who's related to who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| And so if the only—the residential occupancy standards of the old code were based on family members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2935)|
| 0:49:04| and we backed off of that, and now we've got it based on the square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| So I'm not sure—the only time I see family come up in the zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2947)|
| 0:49:13| is when we're talking about single family, two family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| and then we're really just talking about dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| And so I'm not sure if it warrants a long conversation because there's no regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| It's a term, but relationships are not regulated in this zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2965)|
| 0:49:34| And that does come from a place of making sure that we're not discriminating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| against any kind of a nontraditional family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| You know, we won't be able to think of every particular scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| So that's where that kind of concern and the shift in the mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| as far as the square footage requirements came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| I'm just going to go down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| I don't know who—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Dawn, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| We're electrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Gail, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| No, they're just coming on randomly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3009)|
| 0:50:11| We're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3011)|
| 0:50:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Any other—Stephanie, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| I just wanted to add to the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Am I muted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3023)|
| 0:50:24| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| Sam, thanks for bringing that up because I'm wondering if that concern came from—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| as soon as you brought that up, I thought, oh, my gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| can we leave that definition in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| Because there was a big discussion, and it actually was in the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3033)|
| 0:50:38| There was a definition of family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| and it struck me as somewhat discriminatory the way that family was defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| And then I think after our very lengthy discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| we decided that the best way to handle it, I think we put it back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| And then I think we had another vote, and we took it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| That may be where the—yeah, that may be where the concern came from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| is that that definition that was in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| because I heard from some of the same constituents who you're representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| that were concerned about that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| So I think we resolved the concern by just removing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| and relying on the square footage definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| And I can tell you as well as the keeper of all of the Word documents of this particular recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| I can definitely tell you that is where it used to be, was on page 4-2, part C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| And that was just as Councilman Welch stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| It was not presented to council at first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| and then we put that functional family definition right back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| and then we took it right back out and based it on the property maintenance code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| which is what you'll see in there for 4.2C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| So when I see the designations of single family dwelling unit and so on and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3106)|
| 0:51:51| that is just with respect to the square footage of the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Somewhat to the square footage, but also it goes back to the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| A single family is one that's designed for one group of people, not necessarily a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| but it doesn't have two separate eating or kitchens, two separate living areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| two separate bathroom areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| It's just more the type of dwelling as opposed to who may occupy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| And then the residential occupancy standards of square footage define how many people can be in that structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| And to some extent, I think we just kept the single family, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| the terminology in there because it matches the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| and it makes administrative life a lot easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| But as far as the definition for family, no, we no longer have that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| And I appreciate all of you, those with better memories than I, remembering how we dealt with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3164)|
| 0:52:51| because there was a great deal of discussion about that definition of functional family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| and putting it in and taking it back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| And thanks, Stephanie and Christina, for remembering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| And Amy, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| I'm not even close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| Okay, any other items of interest, any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| Sorry, I did push my button this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Gerald, can you sort of recap for us what we have left to address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Like, are there other council directives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| There were about 13 items on the list from the council, the council directives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| And I can't, to be honest, I can't recall them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| I'll send that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| Just to kind of keep us on track with where we've been and where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| And I know council voted on a couple of changes in a meeting, maybe two meetings ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| One, something to monitor, review the need for another single family district between the RN-1 and RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| Monitor the landscape requirements, which is something that we'll just, staff will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| I don't think that's on your list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3253)|
| 0:54:20| Let me keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| We've done that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| I'll send that to Les, the priority list, to the committee this afternoon so you have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3264)|
| 0:54:31| Is this the September document that went out or was the minutes from the September document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3271)|
| 0:54:41| I have the list here if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3283)|
| 0:54:44| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3284)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399200122publicstakeholderadvisorycommittee?start=3295)|
