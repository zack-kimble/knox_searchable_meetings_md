| 0:17:16| You can see the 4,900, 13,000 square feet, and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| So none of these were really big properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| The majority of them were in the RN1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| There was one in the RN2 that's down in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| And these are all properties that were – or most of them were properties that were pre-approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and rezoning requests by this board within the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| You'll see the Greenway Drive ones were part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| You might remember those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| And that's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| I don't know what else – if you guys have any questions, I'm happy to answer any that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1067)|
| 0:17:54| Any questions from the commission to Ms. Porce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| Ms. Porce, thank you for that overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1077)|
| 0:18:04| Next on the agenda is item number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| This is the applicant is Benjamin C. Mullins on behalf of Felton Capital Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| This is two reports, three motions, a sector, a one-year plan amendment, and rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| The address – the location is south of Merchant Drive between Clinton Highway, Pleasant Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| The present plan and zoning designation is low-density residential, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1107)|
| 0:18:34| neighborhood commercial district, agriculture, hillside protection, overlay on 2400 Merchant Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1114)|
| 0:18:43| and agriculture district HPD hillside protection on the remaining property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| The proposed plan and designation is medium-density residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1129)|
| 0:18:58| The staff recommendation is to approve medium-density residential and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| because it is compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Second staff recommendation is to approve MDR medium-density residential and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1149)|
| 0:19:19| because it's consistent, compatible with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| And the third motion, approve NR3 general residential neighborhood zoning district hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1163)|
| 0:19:31| because it's consistent with the surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| Is Mr. Mullins present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| I'd like to hear the opposition first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| Is the opposition present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Mr. Lelow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| Mr. Lelow is with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1198)|
| 0:20:00| Okay. Kevin Mueller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| He's also with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Connie Holland?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1205)|
| 0:20:12| Mr. David Hamilton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1212)|
| 0:20:19| Debbie Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| Mr. Brad Hood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| Any of those available to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Ms. Phillips? Mr. Lelow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| Excuse me. I'm Mr. Lelow. Ms. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| David Hamilton's here. I'm sorry for the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1234)|
| 0:20:38| All right. You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1238)|
| 0:20:42| And if you have others interested in speaking, please share that time with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| You have, please give us your name and your address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| I'm David Hamilton. I have a law office at 1810 Merchant Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| and also reside within the same community at 2000 Tremont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| I'm very concerned about the development of this plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| because Merchant Drive has not been adequately increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1270)|
| 0:21:17| in its capacity between Pleasant Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| and almost the center of the proposed lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| In fact, one of the choke points on Merchant Drive is Wilkerson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| The Merchant Drive, most of you may be aware, is three lane after you cross Clinton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1295)|
| 0:21:43| but not for the last roughly half mile or quarter mile of Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1303)|
| 0:21:51| In fact, almost a beam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| 2401 Merchant Drive is when the three lane reduces to a two lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| with that off center Y Wilkerson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| The proposal that I've heard is suggesting that they're going to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| almost 2000 cars a day, daily trips to a road that already has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| 10,000 cars a day on a two lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| This is a significant increase in the stress on the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1344)|
| 0:22:32| of the neighborhood does not take into account the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| that that intersection presently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1359)|
| 0:22:46| until it is corrected, is a choke point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| at the exact epicenter of this business that wants to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1372)|
| 0:23:00| These planning commissions were all developed to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| this project while it may comply with hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1385)|
| 0:23:17| and otherwise is going to comply with the existing zoning does not take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| into account the infrastructure of the road situation at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1404)|
| 0:23:35| Knox County roads are not uniformly compliant with current standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1415)|
| 0:23:45| for a higher capacity road like merchants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| This choke point was supposed to be repaired and fixed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| more than a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| Almost two decades ago is part of the promise by Victor Ash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| It never got done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| When you look at the chart, Mayor Rojero took credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| for three-laning Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| They repaved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| They did not change the infrastructure of the road so that the two lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| that exists from the commercial district right there to Pleasant Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| where they do split it into a three lane with a right and left lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1463)|
| 0:24:29| and the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| But at the entrance of Debonair, it's a two lane road all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| to even with, yes, this gives you a view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1479)|
| 0:24:46| Mr. Hamilton, excuse me, but if you could wrap up your comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| I know that Ms. Holland and Ms. Phillips would like to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| the commission too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| If you could wrap it up as soon as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| allow them time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| My specific objection would be withdrawn if the city would do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| necessary road work infrastructure to support the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| 2,000 cars a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Chair would allow Ms. Phillips, you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Yes, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| I represent the Norwood Homeowners Association and we are opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| to this 216 to 250 development due to the traffic overload we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| already experienced in the bottleneck portion of Merchants Road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| I have previously stated in my comment to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| We also have single family developments being built within 0.7 miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| of this proposed zoning down on Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| which will add traffic to this bottleneck portion of Merchants Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| We also have to remember we've got Norwood Elementary and Northwest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Middle School within half a mile of this proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| and it's going to cause a greater risk of a child being hit by a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| than already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| Developing a large complex is going to stamp a big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| huge carbon footprint by leaving us with less trees to clean the air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| and more cars to pollute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| This property would be an ideal place for a nature park due to what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| This property has attempted rezoning several times in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| including the previous owner, the Girl Scouts, and was turned down by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| The current developer owner of the property has indicated that he can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| 216 apartment complexes on the current zone CN without any rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| The CN zoning from the front of that property does not need to be a CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1611)|
| 0:26:58| zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| It was not reevaluated when Recode used its zoning from the outdated code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1619)|
| 0:27:08| We have no new roads or utilities to allow this type of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| The NHA, Norwood Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| position is to leave the agricultural hillside and reevaluate the current CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| portion to either low-density residential or, at the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| RN3 for nothing more than duplexes, townhouses, and or single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| Thank you, Ms. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| Chair will recognize Ms. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| We can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Please keep your comments limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| We're going over the time, but I'll grant you additional time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1667)|

| 0:28:00| Road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| The most we would recommend for this bottleneck portion of Merchant's Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| is RN3, duplexes, townhouses, and or single-family dwellings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| but no apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| We are overloaded with apartment complexes now within a half-mile radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| of the proposed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| The developer states he can already zone or use that area that is zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| CN to build 216 apartment units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| We also recommend that the agricultural and the hillside protection remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| as is with no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you for the extra time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| Thank you, Ms. Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Mr. Mullins, I'll grant you additional time to speak beyond your five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| If you could again state your name and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| here on behalf of the applicant and now owners of Hilton Capital Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1735)|
| 0:29:00| I appreciate all the comments from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| Early on, we reached out to both representatives of the Norwood Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1742)|
| 0:29:07| Association and the Norwood Homeowners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| and I've had multiple conversations both with Ms. Phillips and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Hood on the telephone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| and we had three separate Zoom conferences with the neighbors to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| many of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| Our request is for RN-5 zoning with the MDR-0 sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| I do understand staff has evaluated this and recommended RN-3 with the MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| There is RN-5 in the area immediately adjacent to this parcel at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| northeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1789)|
| 0:29:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1790)|
| 0:29:51| Don't interrupt while he's speaking, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| There's existing RN-5 immediately adjacent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| as can be seen on the zoning map in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| And the MDR sector plan used to accommodate RN-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| and that was only recently changed by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| which is why the MDR-0 is sought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| When we looked at this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| we evaluated what could be done without any rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| One of the changes in the new zoning ordinance was neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| does allow multifamily zoning as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| So we had Randolph Architecture look at the dimensional standards and design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| standards for multifamily in the neighborhood commercial zone and come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1829)|
| 0:30:33| with a concept plan, not because that's what we want to move forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| but because we wanted to understand what we could do to explain how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| would be different than what we actually want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| And that was the concept plan that is in the packet of information I sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| which did show we could do approximately 216 units on that property as it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| without rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| And that would include amenities such as a clubhouse pool and dog park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| What we actually are looking to do and why we need the RN-5 is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| consideration of multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| where we can spread out on the 18.94 acres of the property that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| you know, outside of the steep slopes of the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| In staff's recommendation and report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| there's a slope analysis that shows that there's 18.94 acres of this total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| 39.3 acres that is 15% or less slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| And, you know, from an engineering and design standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| that makes the most sense to concentrate our development in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| even though we can disturb up to 24.9 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1897)|
| 0:31:41| And multifamily for 250 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| that would allow us the flexibility to design a quality multifamily complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1904)|
| 0:31:51| keep as much of the existing vegetation as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| add sidewalks along the frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| even explore options of potentially expanding Merchant's Road along that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| frontage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| because there would need to be a traffic impact analysis done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| even though it would be a permitted use at that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1926)|
| 0:32:08| and maybe address some of the concerns that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| Hamilton raised of promises made on Merchant's Drive that have not yet been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| We also have been talking to and communicating through the associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| the possibility of creating a kind of a micro urban wilderness or walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| trails along the back portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| since that is very heavily wooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| There's some topographical issues there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| and that would be an opportunity to create a public amenity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| both for our potential residents and for the neighborhood as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| Staff's recommendations for RN3, as far as density and impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| I don't think there's a big difference between what the RN3 would allow and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| The only difference is RN3 would not allow multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| If you look at the dimensional design standards for RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1977)|
| 0:33:01| and I have that here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| that it allows up to 8.7 dwelling units an acre for single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| 11.6 dwelling units an acre for duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| and 13.5 dwelling units an acre for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| That's if you apply the dimensional standards to a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| If we were to keep that type of development within the same 18.94 acres that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| we've been discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| that would allow up to 165 single family units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| up to 220 duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| and up to 256 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| And based on the research we've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| even some of the research the community has done with regard to impact on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| that would have a greater impact on the schools than multifamily does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| In the packet is some information that one of the neighbors compiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| He works in the schools and looking at the amount of students that come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| the existing market rate apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| And if you were to apply that to a 250 unit apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2035)|
| 0:34:00| you would be looking at approximately 57 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Single family housing and duplexes and townhomes would have even a greater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| impact than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| This is in between two parental zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2049)|
| 0:34:15| This is there's two bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| There's a cat transit line through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| It meets the requirements to expand the density of this property within an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| infill area of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| As noted by staff's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| we would just like to have the flexibility to do an RN five multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| development instead of the RN three that is recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And I would respectfully request that you approve our application on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| Recognize commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| And I also miss Holland had a dog that I'm dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| So I apologize to the rest of the commissioners for the barking dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| I have a question for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Mullins, just to clarify the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Girl Scouts are the former owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| The current owner is your, the group you're representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| They, they wanted to go ahead and purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| They are very intent on developing the property in some form or fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| As shown by the fact they're willing to go ahead and invest the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| the money in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| in purchasing the property as opposed to rezoning in the past where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| been options. And then if the zoning wasn't, wasn't approved, they would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| they would walk away from the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| They're they're committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| And I think the level of neighborhood involvement they've had and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| outreach we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| it shows that they're committed to trying to make a good development for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2143)|
| 0:35:45| Another question is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| You mentioned there's been some discussion about trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| something like the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| There were comments from community members who said they were interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| Is that contingent on something or is that definitely part of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| the plan being put forth regardless of the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| Well, I mean, we want to know what we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| what we can do to see what opportunities there. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| I've had some communications with the neighborhood and I think council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| city council member Thomas has suggested that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| You know, there's been some neighbors that have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| they don't really like that idea. So it's a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| We're willing to have, you know, the, the, with the topography there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| with the vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| with a lot of the engineering challenges that you would get into on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| balance of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| I don't think any developer would really be able to do much outside of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| the 18, 20 acres that we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| So that just presents instead of leaving it vacant, leaving it, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| undeveloped, maybe allowing there to be an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| It's not contingent upon anything. It's just a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| I think we just now started in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Last question is, can you repeat, you went through a series of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| this is the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| And I was trying to write it down, but it sounded like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| RN5 would allow for 250 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| RN5 would allow for more than 250 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| 250 units is the concept that we want to move forward with the RN5 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| But when you look at RN3 and what it allows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| which is what staff's recommendation and you apply the dimensional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| RN3 with the current dimensional standards in place would allow 8.7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| dwelling units an acre for single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| It would allow 11.6 dwelling units an acre for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| And it would allow 13.5 dwelling units an acre for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| And if you were just looking at still keeping the development at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| 18.94 acres, that's 15% slope or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| which is the front part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| That's not in the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| You know, that would equal 165 single family units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| Potentially 220 duplexes or 256 townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| So when we're talking about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2286)|
| 0:38:07| the potential impact to the community based upon the density of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| the plan that we're wanting to move forward for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| I think is actually going to have less impact than what can be done at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| And that's the point I was trying to make with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Chair will recognize commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Ben, when it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| As we're considering this swap of CN for the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| for the RN five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| Would there, would it make sense to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| The depth of the RN five zoning back so far on the property and leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| the rest of the balance of the property in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| Some sort of ag zone, so there's no opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| So I'm not sure that's a question that I would be able to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| As long as it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| the line was drawn in a way where the density that we're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| You know, for 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2338)|
| 0:38:59| I don't, there wouldn't be any objection to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2341)|
| 0:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| Chair recognizes commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2347)|
| 0:39:08| I'm still trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| I'm still trying to grapple with this and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| You are asking for an RN five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| Zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| And you have stated, I'm speaking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| You have stated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2363)|
| 0:39:24| With that, you might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| Do some enhancements, trails, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Up in the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| But with the orange zone, we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| there's no guarantee that you will actually do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| Given any thought to coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| Through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| Designation that would help our PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| PD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| I always get county and city mixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| That would allow the neighbors and the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| The, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| We, we haven't discussed the plan development concept with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| with staff or whether staff thinks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We would be able to meet the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| The metrics that are required for planned development for a multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| So I don't know if we would qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| What we've done is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2422)|
| 0:40:25| We've, we've been able to find a tune.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| Some of your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| And we then actually know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| The trails would be going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| We haven't discussed the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Concept with, with staff or whether staff thinks that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| We would be able to meet the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| The metrics that are required for planned development for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| What we are willing to do is continue the conversations, even as this moves through City Council, and look at working with Councilmember Thomas, who expressed an interest in this, and this is in his district, about maybe some type of development district or some development agreement or something of that nature with regard to the trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2442)|
| 0:41:02| That's all been very preliminary conversations that came up during the outreach we had with the community, that there was an interest in that, but we really haven't had a chance to explore that in any detail other than to communicate that we're open to the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2462)|
| 0:41:16| Hey, Commissioner Phillips, I think I froze when I was trying to talk. Can I jump back in here and ask my question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Ben, my question was, I don't know, as we're talking about trying to swap the CN for the RN-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2483)|
| 0:41:34| Would it be appropriate to come back so far on this property and leave the balance of the property zoned agricultural and not rezone the whole property RN-5 so we can almost create some sort of conservation easement on the back third or two-thirds of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2494)|
| 0:41:52| Does that make any sense, or do you have to have enough of it rezoned for densities and such?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2512)|
| 0:42:00| You know, I don't know where that line would be, Commissioner Hooten. I think that we would, you know, the RN-5, the 250 acres for RN-5, if you're looking at the entire density, would be, you know, 6.4 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2520)|
| 0:42:18| So it's very small density if you're considering all 39 acres. If we're just looking at the part that's 15% or less that we've been talking about where we want to focus the development, that's 13 dwelling units an acre, still well within the densities that would be allowed for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2538)|
| 0:42:33| So I think we're open to the idea. I just don't know where that line would need to be drawn so we would have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| I think that's very possible that we could do it that way, but we haven't had any conversations with staff to explore where that line would need to be drawn to still work the development away and make sense for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2559)|
| 0:42:53| That would make me feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| Commissioner Hooten, any more comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| That would make me feel comfortable. Just making sure that we have the ability to stop some person at a certain point and not use the balance of the property. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2581)|
| 0:43:13| Thank you. I would agree with Commissioner Hooten's concept there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| Before I go to a couple of other commissioners that would like to speak, I would like staff representatives, Portia to discuss specifically what Commissioner Hooten had mentioned in terms of rezoning the front part and leaving some type of a conservation easement in the back two-thirds of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2599)|
| 0:43:42| Miss Portia, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Yes, I'm available. We would still be recommending the RN3 for the front portion. I don't think that we would have any issue with preserving the rear part of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2625)|
| 0:43:57| Obviously, I haven't discussed that with anyone else, but that would be my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| If the property was rezoned, are there mechanics in place that would allow to do what Commissioner Hooten discussed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2643)|
| 0:44:16| I will defer to Amy on that as to how they would go about creating some sort of conservation easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| The only other thing I could think of is determining where that line would be to divide between the ag zone and the RN3 zone or RN5, if you choose to go that route, where that line would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2663)|
| 0:44:34| It could just be that it's ag zoning and the other zoning on the front part of the property. If you wanted to create a conservation easement, I'll defer to Amy as to how that could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2674)|
| 0:44:45| Could the area that's designated as conservation be utilized for calculating the density of the remaining portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2685)|
| 0:44:54| I guess that's either you or Miss Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| Sure. The city zoning ordinance looks at development based on the dimensional standards, so it's not limited by density per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2697)|
| 0:45:08| You're really looking at the dimensional standards and what the additional constraints are in terms of roads and other topographic features that might dictate where you would put lots and buildings and etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2708)|
| 0:45:20| Commissioner, correct me if I'm wrong, I think what we're talking about here is a split zone, which we've done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| We don't prefer to do it, but it's definitely been done and you see it all over the county and the city, so that's something that we could explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| I would suggest that we don't do it here in the meeting and I guess my recommendation would be a postponement if that's something that wanted to be considered, and then we could work with the applicant to determine where that line might make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2735)|
| 0:45:46| Yeah, that was what I was going for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| And, you know, I would certainly defer to Mr Mullins who's the applicant as to whether or not he would accept a 30 day postponement to work with staff on where that line would be drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2749)|
| 0:46:01| For me, we've had so many zoning requests over the years on this thing and I think it would behoove all of us to take the time to establish that boundary and clean up the C and zoning, get it right, get the density right, and kind of make sure that we all know that nothing's going to happen on the hill and on that sensitive part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2761)|
| 0:46:25| Nobody's going to ever have to worry about it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Chair recognize Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| Yes, I had the same question is Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| And I think I think that that's, that's the best solution for this property is to see if we could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| If we could keep the egg on the back portion, and then I would be comfortable with the orange on the front portion under that circumstance I think that's a great direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2803)|
| 0:46:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| Recognize Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Yes, I have a couple of questions for either staff or been about merchant drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| Then you mentioned that a traffic study is not necessarily required but you're interested in and planning to do a traffic study to see if maybe widening merchant might be beneficial to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2827)|
| 0:47:21| I think, I think we will need to do some type of traffic impact analysis to do the permitting process to what degree I'm not sure we haven't spoken to engineering fully about what that would require but given the amount of traffic that's already on merchants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2841)|
| 0:47:36| versus any traffic any development on this property would add to merchant, I think that would be something that they would they would require us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| And that would be an opportunity maybe at least along the frontage of our property which does have a lot of frontage on on merchants where there might be an opportunity to address some of the concerns that currently exists there, and still give us room to develop the property in a way that makes sense for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2865)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you. And then, I guess, I don't know if this is for staff but as far as sidewalks I might have asked this question a month ago, with sidewalk be required or a traffic crosswalk that would be really actually safe for kids to cross over to the other side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2882)|
| 0:48:21| within the parental responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Yes, sidewalks would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| I would ask the city what their requirements would be for the crosswalk so as far as evaluating the crosswalk this is Curtis Williams with city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2908)|
| 0:48:39| That's something that we would have to look at, I guess detailed plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| And consider where, if that could go somewhere and safely be installed so I think that would probably be looked at a little bit further when we had maybe a specific plans in to review and kind of see how that fits with the site and the existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2924)|
| 0:49:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| Any other questions for anything else recognizes Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2948)|
| 0:49:16| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I'm trying, I'm still grappling with the impact the density impact difference between our in three and our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2958)|
| 0:49:28| And I'm going to ask a question of Mr. Mullins and then I'm going to ask the same question to staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2968)|
| 0:49:34| Even the density differences dimensional regulations, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2974)|
| 0:49:42| What is the difference in number of units between our in three and our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2982)|
| 0:49:51| For what type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| The RN three allows single family duplexes and townhomes are in five allows the same uses with the addition of multifamily which is an option for our in three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=2994)|
| 0:50:04| Maximum density allowed in each of the two zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| It depends on the use with the dimensional design standards the maximum density per acre for both the RN three and the RN five for single family is both 8.712 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3009)|
| 0:50:23| For our in three for duplexes, it would allow 11.6 dwelling units an acre if you apply the dimensional standards to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| Our in five duplexes are 17.4 dwelling units an acre which would would be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| Our in three would allow 13.5 dwelling units an acre for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| I'm sorry, our in three would allow 13.5 dwelling units an acre for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| We're also allowing our in five 21.7 dwelling units an acre per townhomes. That's just applying the dimensional standards to a generic one acre lot to come up with what density is allowed under the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3046)|
| 0:51:01| Those numbers would necessarily have to be adjusted based upon the actual design and engineering of any specific site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3061)|
| 0:51:09| I, I didn't ask my question, clearly enough and I apologize for that. I'm sorry, had given some information earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| And I was as fast as I can. I was trying to write it down and I didn't quite get it all. But you have one point you had said 256 units townhomes under the RN five, I'm looking for like total numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3078)|
| 0:51:33| I'm trying to, I mean, because I can't do that multiplication in my head. Just if you had our in three, and you wanted to maximize that density, what would it be if you had our in five, and you wanted to maximize that density total units, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3093)|
| 0:51:51| Sure, and the numbers I gave were considering the RN three, and only considering the 18.9 acres that's 15% slope or less. Just looking at that amount of acreage with the requirements of our in three, it would allow 165 single family housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3111)|
| 0:52:14| It would allow it to 220 duplexes and potentially 256 townhomes. That's just applying the dimensional standards to 18.94 acres. I could do them. I have not done the math for that for our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3134)|
| 0:52:30| It would be more for duplexes and townhomes. I haven't done the math on on those for our in five since our concept is multifamily in our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3150)|
| 0:52:46| And what would be density for multifamily be in our in five. I mean, number total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| The total density allowed for our in five is it's a little complicated for the first acre, it would be up to 30 dwelling 30.04 dwelling units an acre. I'm sorry I said that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3173)|
| 0:53:06| 28.59 dwelling units an acre for the first acre and 30.04 dwelling units an acre for each additional acre that would be the absolute maximum you could build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3186)|
| 0:53:17| That's not what our concept is just to be clear, but I understand when you are talking about rezoning you're looking at potential impact, not just what we are moving forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3197)|
| 0:53:26| And what is the maximum number of units that you're hoping to achieve 250 multifamily units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3206)|
| 0:53:34| And may I ask staff if they concur with this analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3214)|
| 0:53:41| So that's the interesting thing about the city's any ordinance and I'm going to share my screen again because I've got the city's any ordinance pulled up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3221)|
| 0:53:51| So, here's the standards for the R and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3231)|
| 0:53:57| And so this is the uses that it allows so instead of saying it's X amount of dwelling units per acre what it does is it gives a certain amount of square feet for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3237)|
| 0:54:07| So in single family the minimum lot size you can have is 5000 square feet and you can do a rough calculation based on the land that you have to get you know what equates to a density so that's what Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3247)|
| 0:54:17| Mellon's is referring to. So, for townhouses you've got 12,000 square feet for the first three dwelling units and then 3000 square feet after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3257)|
| 0:54:25| And so that's basically what you how you would calculate to get the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| Again multifamily is not allowed and are in three townhouses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| So once you come down to our in five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| You've got 5000 square feet for the first two dwelling units and then 14,000. I'm sorry for 1450 square feet for each additional dwelling unit after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3279)|
| 0:54:49| And so again just not really understanding what their site plan is or what they're looking at it's kind of difficult to calculate down a density and get a number like what you might be used to talking about is this all just based on these lot sizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3289)|
| 0:55:02| or the amount of land allowed or required I guess for each different type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3302)|
| 0:55:08| So, you know, looking at that 18.9 acres, multiply by the 43,560 square feet in an acre, then you would subtract that 5000 units and then 5000 square feet for the first two and then divide that by 1450 that would give you your, your calculation I have to haven't done that calculation I did it for 15 acres instead of the 18.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3308)|
| 0:55:34| So anyway, I don't know the exact number to give you but that's basically how you would calculate it and that's why we don't have a density in the staff report for you to refer to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3334)|
| 0:55:45| If I could clarify on that too I mean what the numbers I was giving is based on, you know, basically one acre and those dimensional standards you just kind of project what that might look like since we're used to talking about it in that in that form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3345)|
| 0:55:59| And I think these are numbers actually received from from planning, a few months ago and how they have done the math to kind of look at what what what that might be but again it's going to be very site plan specific what it actually is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3359)|
| 0:56:13| So we're just talking in generalities with the new dimensional standards of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3373)|
| 0:56:22| Chair will recognize Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| I think I really like Commissioner Newton's idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| I think it has a lot of merit and I think it will end up producing the best result about postponing for 30 days and having time to allow the kind of use the applicant desires but also to conserve the property on the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3392)|
| 0:56:48| I like the difference between these two under our in three I think if you wanted to do townhouse townhouses you could get around 220 to 250 units on there but the biggest difference is our in five allows apartments and I don't think our in three does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3408)|
| 0:57:03| And so if the applicants telling us they want to do 250 apartments and they're willing to conserve the back part of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| I think we should give them 30 days to try to work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| If we did that is there any reason not to take action on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| That's one thing we could do unless is there any reason not to do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3439)|
| 0:57:26| My opinion is no but I will let Miss Brooks comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3446)|
| 0:57:37| Good afternoon. It's my opinion. It may be best for all three of them to go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| And it does require the one year plan amendment, but there's no hard and fast rule on it. You all can take action if you'd like to on the plan amendments now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3462)|
| 0:57:54| I hate to jump in here but if we're going to create a line with agricultural zoning in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| That may be a line where we're going to stop a sector plan change or something. So, I think it probably be best if we waited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3481)|
| 0:58:10| Okay, that's why I was asking. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| Yes, I just want to make sure that we've talked about split zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| Many people seem to be in favor of that, but it's always been said in the breath of we'll do this and we'll, we'll go ahead with our advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| And I want to make sure that that's not necessarily what we're talking about it might be on five it might be on three that still has to get voted on regardless of the drawing of a line and reserving a section for agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3514)|
| 0:58:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| Entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| I'll make a motion if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Like to make a motion that we postpone all three for 30 days to give work through the scenario that Commissioner laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3544)|
| 0:59:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Motion by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3558)|

| 1:01:34| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| Before we begin discussions on this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| I just wanted to clarify that the traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| that was submitted by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| has been deemed to be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| by both planning staff and engineering and public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| to meet that section one policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| subsection 3.5D of the growth policy act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| to allow consideration of an increase in density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| up to the three dwelling units per acre by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3716)|
| 1:02:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| Mr. Mosley, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3726)|
| 1:02:15| Juanis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| Sorry, I'm sorry, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| I'm gonna be representing the applicant on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| I was having trouble unmuting myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| I don't think we have any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| So if you'd like to go ahead and proceed with the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| and your name and address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Thank you, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| I've been Mullins 550 West Main Street here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| for the applicant, S.D. Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| This was postponed last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| so we can have conversations about the scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| and application of section 3.5 of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| I think there was some conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| about what does that mean for this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| And I appreciate Director Brooks's explanation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| And we would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| We submitted a traffic impact letter as part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| So we can provide some limited information up front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| at the rezoning phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| as to what the potential traffic impacts may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| as that would bring it under the ambit of section 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| and allow there to be an extension of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| up to three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| in the rural residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3814)|
| 1:03:35| without a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| As you'll recall, the original application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| was for four dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| and that would require a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| to LDR, Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| What S&E is offering today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| is to keep the sector plan as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| but rezone this up to three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| with the final density that would be determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| once there's additional engineering done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| traffic impact done in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| to see exactly what the density would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| And to be clear, the difference in density on this zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| for the two dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| that staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3855)|
| 1:04:17| and the three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| that S&E is proposing is three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| And normally that wouldn't be a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| It certainly doesn't have a big deal on the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| as far as traffic goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| but this is a relatively speaking fairly small lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| It adjoins commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| but there are several larger lots in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| And so the difference in a return investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| for three units on a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| for a property that's only 7.2 acres is very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| And so that's why we require at a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| three dwelling units an acre to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| in this property and that would be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| with the rural residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| with the application of the standards 3.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| So that's what our application is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| Now I have, we submitted a traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| to planning, county engineering has seen that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| County engineering has said they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| that this would be significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| but ultimately that's up to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| to make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| So we would ask that under these circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| and the fact that a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| would not be needed to go up to three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| that this be approved at planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| at three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| Another thing that was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| it's not in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| but there have been discussions about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| Quite a bit of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| there's some hillside protection issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| and floodway issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| There's, it looks like a potential blue limestream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| that traverses the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| We would be amenable to a greenway across the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| in that area close to the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| while allowing us to concentrate our development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| on the front portion of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| And I know there was conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| and a very good dialogue between Commissioner Korbelik| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| and Commissioner Uten about why that would make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| and why increased density allows increased flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| in projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| And Mr. Uten, I don't think anyone could have said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| that better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3982)|
| 1:06:23| That's exactly the concept that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3983)|
| 1:06:25| So with all those considerations in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| we would respectfully ask that you rezone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| to three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| I don't see any hands up by commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| I know we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| Commissioner Graf, I'll recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| I was wondering what part did the hillside protections plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4006)|
| 1:06:53| what number did it come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| Did it lower, did it keep it at two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| Or where does that figure fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| Ms. Poirier or Ms. Brooks can respond to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4028)|
| 1:07:12| What would that allow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4032)|
| 1:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| So the slope analysis recommended 1.92 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| per acre, which was one of the reasons that we went| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| with the two dwelling per acre recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| And also just a point of clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| the track itself is 6.98 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| If you multiply the three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| that the applicant would be comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| that's 20 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| The two dwelling units per acre that we're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| is 13 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| But the other floodplain, the slope analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| did recommend 1.92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| But I thought you just said, or Mr. Mullins said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| that it only amounted to three dwelling units additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4072)|
| 1:07:57| Yeah, that's why I brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| I was a little confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| So what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| I'm sorry, I did misspeak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| And I think the reason for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4086)|
| 1:08:09| when the slope analysis is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| the 1.92 dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| which is what was in staff's report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4094)|
| 1:08:15| that starts with the analysis starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| at a two dwelling unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| So if you take two dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| apply the slope analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| you get to 1.92 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| If you were to apply that for three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| you would get a different density than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| So it depends on what number they start with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| as to what the slope analysis shows is compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| For example, you ask for the four dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| which was the original application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| that would, the slope analysis would reduce that down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| to 3.3 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| All we're asking for at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| because of the growth policy plan in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| is the three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| So I'm a little slow on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| Are you going to increase it by three or by six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| The density, by three more units or by six more units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| If it's two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| that would be 13.8 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| If it's, I'm sorry, if it's two dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| that would be 13.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| If it's three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| that would be 20 point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| So that's the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| I did misspeak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| I was thinking about the difference between four and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| So I did misspeak and I apologize about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| It would be about seven units total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| Chair will recognize Commissioner Corbill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4190)|
| 1:09:55| Yes, this is just sort of a background question for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| I understand that if this is the proceeds and receives PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| that it would have a more detailed traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| And I'm still a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| When does the future traffic generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| from the Ball Homes 117 acre PR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| which is across the street and a little bit West,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| when is that factored into the traffic report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| Would that occur when they come back for their concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4227)|
| 1:10:37| Karen, would you mind speaking to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| since you're more familiar with the traffic impact analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| the letters and the studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| Sure, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| Okay, so the traffic study for the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Ms. Baird, can you speak up a little louder please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| Yes, I will try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| The property, are you talking about the other property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| to the Southwest over here where the pointer is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| Yes, it's 8E20UR and 4F85RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4269)|
| 1:11:16| Okay, so when those proposals came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| for the Planning Commission to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| we looked at, with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| we came up with the intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| in which they were going to study for this traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| Since this traffic study for that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| is called the seal property subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| we only looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4299)|
| 1:11:41| and this is in agreeance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| with Knox County Engineering as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| we looked at only the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| of Hickory Creek Road and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| We did not look at Marietta Church Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| because they are considering working with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| on creating a roundabout and improving the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| of Hickory Creek Road and Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| And so with that, with all the changes in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4323)|
| 1:12:07| with using part of that land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| and looking at the traffic within that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| we considered only that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| to look at this traffic impact letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| that is for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| that is in consideration right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| is only for, the only reason why the traffic letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| was completed was because of the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4347)|
| 1:12:31| and because it is in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| and it is outlined in the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| that it is needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| and it's also in the transportation impact analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| guidelines that were adopted last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| And so we do not, when in the letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| we do not consider a ton of other traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| from these other subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| because we're only looking at a small portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4375)|
| 1:12:58| At this point, we're only looking at a small land area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| and small number of trips to this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| So we only look at the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4386)|
| 1:13:09| of the subdivision to the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| Does that answer your question, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| You did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| I wasn't very clear with my question and let me try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| If we received a request that had enough units in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| that would trigger a full traffic analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| with the future development that has been approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| and let's not look at all homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| because there seems to be some extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| Let's look at the PR, less than two dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| on your map to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| So if the, say the applicant wanted to submit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| a full traffic study, would the future traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4438)|
| 1:14:03| off of English Ivy and Boston Ivy onto Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| would that be taken into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| with the applicant's traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4450)|
| 1:14:13| Yes, that was already considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| in this transportation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| The traffic engineer considered that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| across the street already within the counts and the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| Let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| All right, thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| We'll get through discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| Do we need to deal with the density or zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| before we deal with the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| We need to deal with the sector plan amendment first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| before we get into the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| Okay, we need to deal with both of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| before we get into the density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| Well, when the density would be under the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| so under the second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| I understood that we didn't have to deal with sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| if we didn't have to deal with rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Well, there's a request for changing the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| So we would have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| if you want to leave it at two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4521)|
| 1:15:24| two dwelling units per acre or three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| you can vote to deny the low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| residential designation on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| Then you move on to the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| and then you can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| if you want to go with two acres or three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| I thought applicant withdrew the sector plan request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| The sector plan request is already on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4544)|
| 1:15:48| And we have a question about the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| He was originally requesting the sector plan be amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| but he's now changing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| So if you go by staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| then we can move on to the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| Am I correct, Ms. Porce or Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4564)|
| 1:16:08| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| The two dwelling units or three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| would not need the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| However, if you are looking at the four dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| per acre, it would require it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you, Ms. Porce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Commissioner Graft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| Yes, since this is such a small tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| and the difference is seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| and I can't tell, and I spent a career looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| the difference between three units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| and three and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| you can tell the difference when you get to four and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| And the difference between two and three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| if we can get three, I think that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| And I think we ought to be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| that somebody's looking for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| and not, they might've been looking for four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| but they're willing to come back to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| That makes a good looking subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| I would be all in favor of three to the acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| rather than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| And if we were talking about a hundred acre tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| it might be different, but for seven units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| nobody will ever know the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Chair will entertain a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| to deny LDR low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| I so move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| We have a motion by Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Second by Commissioner Graft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| Call the roll, Ms. Karen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| Commissioner Uten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| Commissioner Easton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4670)|

| 1:17:58| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| Just to clarify, this is to deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| the sector plan amendment, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Okay, I am voting yes to deny the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4690)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4697)|
| 1:18:18| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Commissioner Graft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4710)|
| 1:18:40| Okay, sorry, I don't know what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4723)|
| 1:18:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| Motion carries 11, I'm sorry, 11 ayes, zero nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Before we move to the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| I want to recognize Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| One of the things I want to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| as we move to talking about the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| and I think we talked about it Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| and I think Commissioner Uten did a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| of explaining the advantages of a little more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| in these projects, and it allows them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4753)|
| 1:19:16| a little more flexibility for amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| And having said that, I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| that we approve PR with three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| We have a motion by Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| seconded by Commissioner Graft to approve PR plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4771)|
| 1:19:35| residential at three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| Are there any comments from the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| Yes, I have a question about what Commissioner Graft said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4783)|
| 1:19:49| and someone else, now I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| They referred to the area around this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4791)|
| 1:19:56| and said that there were three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| that that was surrounding area, but I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| All I see is two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| I think 2.8 is the closest we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| and then one point something, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4812)|
| 1:20:23| So we don't have a three dwelling unit per acre anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| It's right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Oh, it was off screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| I guess the other thing I wanted to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| and this was about what Commissioner Graft said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| is that that sort of just made my point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4838)|
| 1:20:41| that it does matter, even if it's a small piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| because we use that as our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| well, is there anything like this around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=4850)|

| 1:23:29| Go ahead, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5009)|

| 1:23:33| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5013)|
| 1:23:36| Sent a few comments in to the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| as well as the commissioners about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| previously appearing before y'all back in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5021)|
| 1:23:45| This is 19 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| It does have significant amount of flood on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5026)|
| 1:23:49| We laid it out as far as a concept for 28 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| and that will be appearing before y'all next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| Granted, zoning goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| So it actually is only gonna yield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| around 1.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| Still just asking for the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| just for flexibility down the road if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| But again, we're laying it out for some larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5048)|
| 1:24:12| In fact, some of these lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| abutting the Beaver Creek River will be up to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5054)|
| 1:24:18| Some of them are three acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| So they're gonna be nice large lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| It's gonna be one of our higher price points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| that we've ever offered in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| So we're excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| I did have a chance to meet with each neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| or talk to each neighbor to the east and to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5076)|
| 1:24:40| I've also met with, there's a Linda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| that lives in Laurel Oak Villas across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| I met with her, I met with Julian B and Miss Griffith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| They are very concerned about flood as they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| And I've assured them that with Smithville Homes name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| and all the TDEC regulations and Knox County regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5100)|
| 1:25:03| that additional flooding won't be caused by our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| There is an inlet or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| an outlet that goes under West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5111)|
| 1:25:16| that floods onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| We will be carrying all their water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| So Laurel Villas and some of the other drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| from across on the north side of West Emory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| goes under the road onto this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| We do anticipate designing it to carry all their water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5133)|
| 1:25:39| put it in our detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| and disperse it on the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| that Knox County allows us to disperse it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| We do not anticipate any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| There's obviously a 500 year flood line and a no fill line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| We don't plan on disturbing anything next to the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| And we would like to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| with the three units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| with an initial yield 28 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5164)|
| 1:26:08| that you'll see on next month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| I will yield the rest of my time to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| from commissioners or opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5175)|

| 1:26:48| Please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| Do you as the commissioners have the pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| that we've seen of the flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| And can you see them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| Commission does, is in receipt of those photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5219)|
| 1:27:08| What was the answer to that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Because it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| that they see these pictures, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Ms. Apsher, the commission did receive the pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| I'm not sure they're looking at them right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5239)|
| 1:27:22| but they did receive them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| It's important that they see them as I speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5248)|
| 1:27:31| Ms. Porche, are you able to project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5251)|

| 1:28:31| I live directly across from this proposed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| I've resided here since 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5315)|
| 1:28:41| Along with my neighbors and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5321)|
| 1:28:43| we have seen the flooding go further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| up to the Emory Road Pace, the 100 and the 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| So we will start on this picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| along with the next two pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| are on both sides of Beaver Ridge Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| It's the beginning of what we consider a flood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5344)|
| 1:29:09| It makes up a great big lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| So all of this water flows also down behind us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| this Emory property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| So those are pictures one through five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| Now, if we can see the picture, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| This is a view from the Connor property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5367)|
| 1:29:33| and it floods too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Now we can go down and look at picture six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| Okay, these three pictures that we're fixing to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| are to the right of the driveway where it's the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| and all of the pictures show the flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| coming up beyond the 100 and 500 flood zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| On picture nine, you can see from across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5398)|
| 1:30:05| this is behind the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| Look how small that creek is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| And then we're going to show you a picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| of where it crosses, thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| crosses, this is all in that field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| that property flooded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5419)|
| 1:30:22| And then the reason that it all goes on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| is where you saw the trees, it is a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| And so that pushes the water toward this proposed property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Thank you, Ms. Thatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| Wait, we have some more pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| Let's go to picture 10, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| This is the picture before flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| Now to the next picture, we will see the flooding picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5453)|
| 1:31:01| In the distance, whoa, whoa, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| I was talking to my daughter, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| See the flooding in the distance beyond the trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| That is the property that is under discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| Then the water keeps, whoa, whoa, whoa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Just letting you compare it, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| Oh, okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| We can show in that picture where the outbuildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| the garages and the floods reach the gardens, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| Here is the, it goes in further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5502)|
| 1:31:46| See the tag in the goal post?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| It is flooded eight inches, eight feet there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| and also gets water from Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| a lot of runoff there too, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5517)|
| 1:32:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| Here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| And on the Oak Ridge side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| the flooding here goes up to the 100-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5528)|
| 1:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| All right, between the pictures of 12 and 13,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| you're traveling down the Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| and the flooding continues till we get to the picture 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| This house was flooded in 2019, the first flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5556)|
| 1:32:42| It had never been flooded before and had to be re-renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5562)|
| 1:32:52| Okay, and then you'll see another picture of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| See, this goes all the way up to Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5577)|
| 1:33:02| and has never been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5582)|
| 1:33:07| Then there is, the picture doesn't show the picture in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5587)|
| 1:33:12| There was a second flood which meant that they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| to replace their air, heat and air conditioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| Air conditioners and the duct work under the home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5601)|
| 1:33:28| Now this is new flooding in Karnesville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| Though the property floods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| it has never reached the house before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| And be mindful that this home is on the opposite side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| of the proposed property where Beaver Creek crosses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| under Oak Ridge Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| at least one mile from the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| Thank you, Ms. Absher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| FEMA states, which she's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5638)|
| 1:34:01| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| I'm not through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Real quick please, we need to move on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| But I would like more time to please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| FEMA states flooding is the most common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| and costly natural disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5656)|
| 1:34:20| And mortgage lenders require that they have flood insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5660)|
| 1:34:26| for properties located in identified floodplain zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| FEMA has identified this property as a floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| Per the Knoxville County website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| it states that if structures are located in a floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| which this is, they will experience some type of flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| It is worth noting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| given all the currently approved construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| in the Karnes area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| per FEMA and flood administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| new buildings, construction, clearing land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| grading and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| can and will cause more flooding issues in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5700)|
| 1:35:05| Also, there is not to be any damage to surrounding areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5705)|
| 1:35:10| because of new construction and flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5710)|
| 1:35:14| The current FEMA maps from this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| have not been updated since May to 207,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5716)|
| 1:35:26| We also contacted West Knoxville Utility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| where there is a sewer pump close to this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5731)|
| 1:35:36| and there has been concern of flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| and potential greater issues around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| They recommended that the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| contact us on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5744)|
| 1:35:47| Mr. Sanders stated on the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5747)|
| 1:35:50| for Metropolitan Commissioners website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| he did not know why the previous developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| did not move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| but he is aware of the flooding pictures of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| Commissioner Mr. Scott Smith had received approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| for this same property in July 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| And after meeting with some residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| posing concerns, flooding being the major one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| the application was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| Now to talk briefly about the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| Ms. Asher, can you wrap this up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| in about 30 seconds, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| We have other business to talk about too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| Why did more people earlier get more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| went over time and had speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5795)|
| 1:36:37| Why can we not have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| We're giving you more time than what is normally allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| Continue please, but try to wrap it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| because we need to still get back with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| We need to talk with public works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| and commissioners have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| So if you could please conclude your remarks here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| And after you have the pictures of the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| There are now 157 homes in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| that has been approved for building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| There's also the townhouses on this stretch of road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| There are 46 townhouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| And then the property that has been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| is 28 making it 186,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| And there are additional homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| Now, if you see the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| you can see the traffic backs up all the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| And when COVID isn't existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| it goes all the way back to the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| Also, this traffic stops due to the two-way stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5865)|
| 1:37:51| Here's a picture that is a very difficult intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| It's dangerous and hazardous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5877)|
| 1:38:03| If you see the FedEx truck, it's coming from the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| These trucks do not stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| It's a 30-mile speed limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5890)|
| 1:38:19| Every FedEx truck, 18 wheelers are speeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| through the intersection of Beaver Ridge and Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| This is not an approved job route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5907)|
| 1:38:29| for these types of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| Traffic has been shunted from Oak Ridge Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| and Industrial Park to this intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| which contributes to the increase in traffic and speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| They are one-tenth of a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| Ms. Absher, I apologize, but you may have some more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5928)|
| 1:38:56| We all have a vested interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| in the development of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| and the decisions that are being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| must ensure we work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| to protect our land and environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you, Ms. Absher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| Mr. Sanderson, you have additional time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5951)|
| 1:39:13| if you'd like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| I had the privilege of meeting with Linda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| and some of her other neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| and her thoroughness and presentation was very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| She shared a lot of light on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| as she's lived there since her theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| and I have assured her that the flooding will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| Obviously, Knox County, TDEC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| and any other government body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| is not gonna allow us to cause any additional flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5984)|
| 1:39:50| I know engineers and this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| everyone can't hang their hat on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| but we do have a reputation in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| as Smithfield homes, and especially in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| And I know the second met a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=5999)|
| 1:40:05| a staff of commission, Mayor Jacob,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| Jim Snowden, Amy Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6009)|
| 1:40:11| any of them called myself or Rocky Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| we would drop whatever job we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| to make sure we address the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| or just the issue that's brought to our attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6017)|
| 1:40:21| Again, we've engineered this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| to stay out of the 500-year flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| engineered this to stay, carry all their water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| or not all their water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| but all the water coming underneath West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| And again, we still have some engineering to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| and you all will see this concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| appear before you next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| again, with zoning allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| But again, Linda and the people I met with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6045)|
| 1:40:52| and the ladies I met with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| were very thorough and very concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| and we respect the concerns of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| And we'll be more willing to work with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| with TDEC, with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| to make sure there's no additional flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| make sure there's no additional issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6065)|
| 1:41:07| The traffic, I know there's traffic that intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| is a nightmare, we will admit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| But we think going down to 20 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| which would only be 1.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| is kind of, I'm not gonna say a win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| because they're not gonna view it as a win,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| but it's kind of a give and take scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| with us and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| So I'll leave it at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| and I'm available for any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Thank you, Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| Mr. Snowden, would you have any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| you'd like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| Are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Or anybody with Knox County Public Works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6105)|
| 1:41:53| All right, Chair, go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Oh, yeah, appreciate it, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| Yeah, a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6118)|
| 1:41:59| We will talk a little bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| obviously, two issues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6121)|
| 1:42:02| the drainage issue and then the roadway issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| We actually had a meeting this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| with the Tennessee Department of Transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| and there is some safety funding available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| for the region that we are going to apply for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| and actually be willing to put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| some additional county money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| to try to extend West Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| to continue that three-lane section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| from where West Emory intersects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| down to Bank and Beaver Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| or pardon me, Beaver Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| and install a traffic signal turn lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6152)|
| 1:42:36| at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| So we're gonna submit a grant application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6158)|
| 1:42:40| for the state for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| The state thinks that if that is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| that we would hopefully start construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| sometime late next calendar year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| So we are hopefully moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6169)|
| 1:42:52| with getting an improvement at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| And then in regard to the drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| I will let our hydrologist, Mr. Leo Cameron,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| speak to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| because he's done more detailed analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| Yes, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| The track there is about 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| 11 acres of that can't be filled at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| It compromises the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| and the inner half of the 100-year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| That's a no-fill zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| and it has to be left alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| The remaining nine acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| they can build on the remaining nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| Their finished floors have to be one foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| above the 500-year flood elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| So leaving that 11 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| should not push the water over to the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| and it should keep the new structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| proposed to be constructed high and dry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6229)|
| 1:43:51| Chair will recognize Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6235)|
| 1:43:56| This is a question probably for Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| or the hydrologist that just spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| but can you say something about the FEMA study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| that was referenced by Ms. Absher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| that the last one took place in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| when there's just been a lot of development in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| So I assume there've been a lot of changes in flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6255)|
| 1:44:19| When would a new FEMA study happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| The FEMA study would be undertaken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| by the federal government, not by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| Beaver Creek is 40 miles long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| from the Gibbs area down to Mountain Hill Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| Flood studies cost about $100,000 a mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| so it wouldn't be something that the county would overtake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6283)|
| 1:44:48| The current maps are from 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Prior to 2007, the maps were from 1983.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6292)|
| 1:44:56| So those maps were out for 24 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6296)|
| 1:44:59| and I anticipate that it probably will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| a similar timeframe before new maps come along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| Thank you, that's what I needed to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| I have a question also for either Mr. Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| or the hydrologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| We, over the last few months that I've been a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| we've gotten a lot of public concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| about flooding on Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And I have started to do some background research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| I've read the Natural Hazards Mitigation Report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6332)|
| 1:45:36| the county, the regional area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| and I'm reading the stormwater regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| And I ran across, so I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| Question number one is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| is the county looking at setting just Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6348)|
| 1:45:53| and determining how to mitigate the cost of flooding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| That's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| And then I just wanted to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| to the commission's attention the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| I think it's the TCIR, which is a state committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| They come out with a estimated cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| for infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6370)|
| 1:46:11| And for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| they indicate we need about $78 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| to fix our wastewater and flooding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| So flooding is a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| And I am asking Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| or I'm so sorry, I didn't catch the hydrologist's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| Is there any plan to study Beaver Creek's flooding problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| and to come up with a mitigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| No, there isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| I want to point out though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| that the county is well above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| the minimum FEMA regulations already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| FEMA prohibits construction from the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| Knox County prohibits fill from the floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6413)|
| 1:46:58| And in addition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| the inner half of the hundred year floodplain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Also, FEMA requires finished floors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6421)|
| 1:47:04| to be at or above the hundred year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6424)|
| 1:47:06| where the county requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| at or above the 500 year plus a foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| As a result of those higher or stringent standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| county residents receive a 10% reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| in their flood insurance premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=6441)|

| 2:00:24| Staff recommendation is to approve variances one through two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| and alternative design standards one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7229)|
| 2:00:33| on the recommendation of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7233)|
| 2:00:36| Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| because site conditions restrict compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| with the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| and the proposed variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7244)|
| 2:00:45| will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| Second motion is approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7248)|
| 2:00:51| subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| Third motion, approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| for up to 155 detached dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7259)|
| 2:01:01| and the reduction of the peripheral setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7261)|
| 2:01:05| from 35 feet to 20 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7265)|
| 2:01:07| for lots 155 subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| Yes, Ben Mullins 550 West Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7276)|
| 2:01:18| suite 500 for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7278)|
| 2:01:20| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| I don't see any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| Let it be shown for the record that Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| will be recusing himself from this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7292)|
| 2:01:38| Also, Mike Reynolds will be staff on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7298)|
| 2:01:43| and we'll present it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| So let me ask Mike to go ahead and present it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7305)|
| 2:01:48| and Mr. Mullins, we'll turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7311)|
| 2:01:53| Thank you, Cameron Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| I'm gonna take over the sharing real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7315)|
| 2:02:07| And so since we didn't have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| to discuss this one during the agenda review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| and Commissioner Korbelik had requested discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| about the connection or lack of connection to Everett Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| we're gonna discuss this with me anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| But after the agenda review meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7346)|
| 2:02:28| the applicant had concerns with one of the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| in the staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| and also the general requirement for double frontage lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| that are for the lots of backup to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| So I'm gonna just kind of give a really brief overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| of what the project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| and then I'll discuss the double frontage lots real fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| and what is the discussion item there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7372)|
| 2:02:56| So as you can see, this is the property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7376)|
| 2:03:01| It's just north of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7381)|
| 2:03:03| Everett Road is just to the left or west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7383)|
| 2:03:06| and that leads down to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7386)|
| 2:03:08| This property is accessed or they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| they're only accessed from Hatmaker Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| which is a road that goes along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| and then comes up Brett's Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7397)|
| 2:03:18| to North Campbell Station Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7398)|
| 2:03:21| which is just to the west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7401)|
| 2:03:22| of the North Campbell Station Road intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| or interchange with the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7406)|
| 2:03:30| Let me get to the plan real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7410)|
| 2:03:33| So actually I'm gonna just kind of skip over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7413)|
| 2:03:37| to this slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7417)|
| 2:03:38| It kind of shows the overall development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| along the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7421)|
| 2:03:42| So our interpretation of the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7422)|
| 2:03:48| is that the interstate is considered a road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| So any lot that backs up to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| and has another frontage will be considered a road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7435)|
| 2:03:59| The issue, so a double frontage lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| is essentially a lot that has two frontages on roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| that do not intersect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7448)|
| 2:04:08| So a corner lot like lot 138 here, I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| that's not a double frontage lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| because it's on a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7454)|
| 2:04:16| It's an intersection of two roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7456)|
| 2:04:20| So that's all that's mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7460)|
| 2:04:21| So the subregs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| I'm gonna just throw this out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| just so everybody knows what the definition is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| So a double frontage lot according to the subregs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| like I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| it's a lot that has two non-intersecting sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| abutting the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7475)|
| 2:04:37| And then a street is considered basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7477)|
| 2:04:40| the right-of-way area that a road goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| So it's an entire width between the boundary lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| of every way that a road goes through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7488)|
| 2:04:50| So it's a lot that has two non-intersecting sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| between the boundary lines of every way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| when any part thereof is open to the use of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7495)|
| 2:04:59| for purposes of vehicular travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| So a street in that sense is a very broad term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| It really does not apply to what we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| like our local streets versus an interstate system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| And then the double frontage lot standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| has two potential lot depth standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| one being 150 foot lot depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| if your lot backs up to a collector street or arterial street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| and the other one is 135 foot depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| you back up to a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7527)|
| 2:05:31| An alternative to the lot depths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| that the subregs provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| is establishing a common area buffer strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| between the external road and the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7538)|
| 2:05:41| that's at least a 25 foot depth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7541)|
| 2:05:44| On occasion, we will accept some kind of alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| to that buffer strip as a variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| which is what's actually on this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7550)|
| 2:05:53| as presented in the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7553)|
| 2:05:57| Try to step through that in just one second as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7557)|
| 2:06:01| Now, as you see the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7561)|
| 2:06:05| don't necessarily say that an interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| is a street that has minimum depth standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| As staff we're interpreting that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| well, an interstate is a higher classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| than arterial street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| and that it would fit under the collector street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| arterial street, minimum lot depth standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7586)|
| 2:06:31| So what the applicant has expressed as a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| is whether or not these lots truly are double frontage lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7596)|
| 2:06:42| as stated, as staff, we do believe they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7602)|
| 2:06:46| And they can present their case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7606)|
| 2:06:50| and what they would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| I just wanted to present a few options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| that we can revisit as the discussion goes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| but just so that everybody kind of understands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| how this process might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| Option number one, in regard to this standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| and let me back up just a hair here, back to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| So what I'm showing here in the blue lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7629)|
| 2:07:11| is the lots that actually do not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| the 150 foot standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| So it's not the entire frontage for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| And on their plan, they do show a 25 foot landscape easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7639)|
| 2:07:23| that was to address staff's comment originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| that those lots were double frontage lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| And then there's a note on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7650)|
| 2:07:32| regarding the type of plantings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7652)|
| 2:07:33| that would be installed in that landscaping easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| So in, which is what you see here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7656)|
| 2:07:44| the applicant's proposal for planting plan number 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7664)|
| 2:07:48| two evergreen trees, two deciduous trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| and eight shrubs per 100 feet within that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7670)|
| 2:07:53| Staff recommendation number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7673)|
| 2:07:55| just pretty much makes that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| more of a generic landscaping standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| of this four large maturing trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| They can still do evergreen trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7683)|
| 2:08:05| They can do the deciduous trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| I just didn't feel like the shrubs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7687)|
| 2:08:08| were really necessary along the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| I didn't really think that was gonna do much of anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| They could still install the shrubs if they care to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| but this would still be within that 25 foot easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7696)|
| 2:08:19| that's shown on the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| So what the planning commission could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| is approve as staff recommends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7707)|
| 2:08:29| which would just show the 25 foot landscape easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| on there, basically approving a variance at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| to allow that landscape easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| to substitute for the 25 foot common area strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7719)|
| 2:08:46| Option two would be to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| the applicant could just on their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| just switch that to a 25 foot common area strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| No landscaping would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| because the sub-right don't require it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7735)|
| 2:08:56| in a 25 foot common area strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| And they can do that after the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7739)|
| 2:09:01| planning commission approved the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| the landscape easement as part of this approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| and the applicant decided to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| to a 25 foot common area strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7748)|
| 2:09:10| They would be meeting the subdivision regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7750)|
| 2:09:11| don't need a variance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| So that they could just switch that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7754)|
| 2:09:15| after the approval if they care to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| Number three, approve a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7759)|
| 2:09:21| to reduce the double frontage lot depths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| to those shown on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| In doing this, the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7765)|
| 2:09:27| would essentially be saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7767)|
| 2:09:29| no common area strip is really necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| and the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| like a landscape easement isn't necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| And the saying that you feel it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7776)|
| 2:09:39| with what they're showing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| that the lots can just back up to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7781)|
| 2:09:46| So that's the three options that we see as staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| is appropriate depending on how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| the planning commission wants to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7792)|
| 2:09:56| I'll be happy to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7796)|
| 2:09:58| in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7798)|
| 2:10:01| And I know we wanted to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7801)|
| 2:10:04| eventually that connection to Everett Road too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7804)|
| 2:10:06| but I don't know if we want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7806)|
| 2:10:09| as a separate discussion or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7809)|
| 2:10:13| And Mr. Reynolds, what's the height difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| between the elevation of the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| and the lots that back up to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| That, maybe the applicant could help out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7823)|
| 2:10:31| I do, I have some notes on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| but it's a little bit hard to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| what the topography doesn't have any numbers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7834)|
| 2:10:38| So, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7838)|
| 2:10:41| Let's, let me turn it over to Mr. Mullins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7841)|
| 2:10:44| and we need to, we'll come back to Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| Mr. Mullins, you'd like to proceed, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7849)|
| 2:10:52| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7852)|
| 2:10:53| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7853)|
| 2:10:57| To answer the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7857)|
| 2:10:59| the height varies along the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7859)|
| 2:11:03| to these lots between 40 to 80 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| over approximately 170 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| from the interstate to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7870)|
| 2:11:13| So, you know, there's a significant increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7873)|
| 2:11:15| in topography and significant distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| between the interstate where it is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| And you, Mr. Reynolds is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7883)|
| 2:11:25| There has been quite a bit of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7885)|
| 2:11:29| about the landscape easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| whether that's required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7892)|
| 2:11:34| about whether or not this actually constitutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7894)|
| 2:11:35| a double frontage lot under the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| Just a bit of background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7901)|
| 2:11:42| the 25 foot landscape easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| that is depicted on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| our engineer included that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| at the initial request of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| When the applicants started looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| a little bit more closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| and then asked if I could present today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| to address some of these issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| we started looking at the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7920)|
| 2:12:03| of double frontage lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| under the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| And in order to be considered a double frontage lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| under the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| section 3.024B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| the street in question has to be a collector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| or arterial street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7938)|
| 2:12:19| according to the major road plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| And the interstate is neither of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7941)|
| 2:12:24| And I was thinking back on developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7944)|
| 2:12:27| I've been involved in in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| along the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| and I don't ever recall there being an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7949)|
| 2:12:32| with double frontage lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| when the interstate was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7953)|
| 2:12:37| So that was something that we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7957)|
| 2:12:39| We did not think we even need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| the condition number three for the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7962)|
| 2:12:44| regarding the 150-foot lot depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7964)|
| 2:12:47| nor do we need any type of landscape easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7967)|
| 2:12:49| or buffer or anything of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| because this doesn't meet the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7973)|
| 2:12:54| of a double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7974)|
| 2:12:57| And so that's, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7977)|
| 2:12:58| that's where there's a difference in staff's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7978)|
| 2:13:00| and the applicant's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7980)|
| 2:13:02| regarding the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7982)|
| 2:13:03| of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7983)|
| 2:13:06| And I also note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7986)|
| 2:13:07| as far as regarding the landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7987)|
| 2:13:09| that 170 feet from the interstate to the lot line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| is heavily wooded as it exists right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7993)|
| 2:13:15| and there's no foreseeable plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7995)|
| 2:13:17| for the interstate in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| to be expanded anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| But I think this really just turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8002)|
| 2:13:23| on the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| if this is a double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8006)|
| 2:13:29| And I know there's a difference in interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| between staff and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8012)|
| 2:13:33| and so I'd like to call upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8013)|
| 2:13:34| Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8014)|
| 2:13:35| who administers the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8015)|
| 2:13:38| to weigh in on whether the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8018)|
| 2:13:40| is considered a street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8020)|
| 2:13:45| whether it's a collector or arterial street or otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| that would constitute a double frontage lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8027)|
| 2:13:49| under the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8034)|
| 2:13:55| Yes, Ben, this is Jim Snow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| with Knox County Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| We've had this question come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| in the past several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| specifically lots of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8044)|
| 2:14:05| as it relates to billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| and other structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| that our codes department permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| And we have to look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| whether or not that is actually a front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8052)|
| 2:14:15| And we've actually got an opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| from our law director about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| because of the ambiguity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| And they have gave us the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8061)|
| 2:14:23| that due to the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8063)|
| 2:14:24| that traffic doesn't access it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8064)|
| 2:14:26| it's not codified in the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| as you referenced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| that we treat these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| or we would treat these spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8071)|
| 2:14:33| from that opinion of the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8073)|
| 2:14:35| that this would not be a dual frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8075)|
| 2:14:39| Thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8079)|
| 2:14:41| And I guess with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| I mean, we agree with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| in every other respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8085)|
| 2:14:46| except removing condition number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8086)|
| 2:14:50| from the variances on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| And we would ask for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| for the concept development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8095)|
| 2:14:58| in every respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8098)|
| 2:14:59| except excluding number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8099)|
| 2:15:01| as this doesn't meet the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| of a double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8105)|
| 2:15:06| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| Staff will recognize Commissioner Corbett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| would you state the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8117)|
| 2:15:19| behind the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8119)|
| 2:15:21| for a double frontage lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| What are these standards hoping to achieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8123)|
| 2:15:29| Well, part of it has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| with eventual widening of roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8131)|
| 2:15:35| but also just giving some space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| between the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8138)|
| 2:15:39| and the rear property lines of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8139)|
| 2:15:41| because without some kind of depth standard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8141)|
| 2:15:48| we could end up with very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| very shallow lots along the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| which could be problematic long-term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8153)|
| 2:15:57| So that's part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8157)|
| 2:15:59| I'm sure they could probably list off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| a few other reasons too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| but I'd say that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8161)|
| 2:16:04| the main reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8164)|
| 2:16:06| So it's not a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8166)|
| 2:16:09| of whether or not you can access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8169)|
| 2:16:12| the arterial road from the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| It has to do more with buffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8174)|
| 2:16:17| as I understand what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| Yeah, I would say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8183)|
| 2:16:27| Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8187)|
| 2:16:35| Thank you, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| When Mr. Snowden was talking a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| he said he was for everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| that staff recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| except for variance three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| I don't see variance three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8206)|
| 2:16:48| I see a alternative design standard three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8208)|
| 2:16:53| which one were you talking about, Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8213)|
| 2:16:57| I think it was Mr. Toedt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I think I was the one that said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Commissioner Roth, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8221)|
| 2:17:03| And I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8223)|
| 2:17:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| I did misspeak again, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| On the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| it was to approve alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| and approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| Of those nine conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| there's condition number three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8238)|
| 2:17:20| which is the one that Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8240)|
| 2:17:22| and I were discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| regarding what staff laid out as three options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| and what I think is a fourth option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8246)|
| 2:17:29| in that as the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8249)|
| 2:17:31| and county engineering has opined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| that the interstate does not create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| a double frontage lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| that condition number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| be removed in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| and then the concept development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8258)|
| 2:17:41| be approved in all their respects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8261)|
| 2:17:44| And engineering said that they do not consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| it a double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8266)|
| 2:17:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8268)|
| 2:17:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8271)|
| 2:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8274)|
| 2:17:55| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| I think we have the variances first, right, Pat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| I'll make a motion we approve variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8283)|
| 2:18:05| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8285)|
| 2:18:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8289)|
| 2:18:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8292)|
| 2:18:13| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8293)|
| 2:18:14| All right, it was seconded by Senator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| Let me recognize Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8299)|
| 2:18:21| her hand's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8301)|
| 2:18:23| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8303)|
| 2:18:25| I have a question for Mr. Mullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| The public comment that we've received on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| has really focused on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8311)|
| 2:18:33| quote, creativity of open spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| And that's been something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| that our group has talked about a good bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| Can you point out the open spaces plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8321)|
| 2:18:45| and articulate how they are being envisioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8325)|
| 2:18:54| Can you pull the plan up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8334)|
| 2:18:58| Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8338)|
| 2:18:58| we're just voting on the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| We're still going to discuss the remainder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| But she asked a question regarding open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| and it's appropriate time to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8349)|
| 2:19:10| So she can, we're okay to listen to it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8350)|
| 2:19:14| And I guess I did have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8354)|
| 2:19:16| to clarify Commissioner Roth's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| The concept plan had approved variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8359)|
| 2:19:23| and the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8363)|
| 2:19:24| one through three subject to the nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| And you made the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| that subject to staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8370)|
| 2:19:32| Is that with or without condition number three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8372)|
| 2:19:34| I guess would be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8374)|
| 2:19:36| And let me pull up and look at the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8376)|
| 2:19:40| The nine conditions are on the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| I'm under the impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| if we do not have to separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8385)|
| 2:19:47| the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8387)|
| 2:19:50| and the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8390)|
| 2:19:56| I'm happy to include those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| because I think some direction here from Pat or Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8399)|
| 2:20:07| I think what Mr. Mullins referred to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8407)|
| 2:20:12| is under the variance you require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| in planning commission approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8414)|
| 2:20:16| it's item number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| Mr. Mullins, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8417)|
| 2:20:19| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8419)|
| 2:20:20| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| we're talking about the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| I think what you're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| is reduce the 25 foot common area buffer strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| for double frontage lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8430)|
| 2:20:31| to allow a 25 foot land street buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8431)|
| 2:20:34| but for lots one through 10 and 16 through 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| You're asking for that to be removed, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| But that's on the concept plan, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| That's not on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| No, that's on the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8446)|
| 2:20:47| If you look under variances commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| there's one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| and then there's alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8453)|
| 2:20:56| requiring commission approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8456)|
| 2:20:58| Those are one, two, and three there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8458)|
| 2:21:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8461)|
| 2:21:03| I think on the next one down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| when it says the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| he's talking about item number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| under the concept plan, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8468)|
| 2:21:11| Is that right, Mr. Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8471)|
| 2:21:16| It is on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| but the variances were...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| The concept plan also refers to variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8481)|
| 2:21:22| and so I was just making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8482)|
| 2:21:24| that any reference to the necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8484)|
| 2:21:29| for having a variance with 150 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8489)|
| 2:21:32| for the lot depth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8492)|
| 2:21:33| and for the landscaping buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| or any 25 foot easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8495)|
| 2:21:40| subject to condition three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| was not part of your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| I just wanted to clarify that's what you meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8503)|
| 2:21:46| My motion only deals with the variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8506)|
| 2:21:50| and the alternative design standards one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| which is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| We haven't been reading all these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8517)|
| 2:21:58| but it's reducing the minimum vertical curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8518)|
| 2:22:00| reducing the 25 foot common area buffer strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| for double fronted lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| but we've already said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8525)|
| 2:22:07| that was not a double fronted lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8527)|
| 2:22:08| so I don't know that that really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8528)|
| 2:22:13| Correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8533)|
| 2:22:15| and then the three alternative design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8535)|
| 2:22:24| What am I missing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8544)|
| 2:22:26| Let's get clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| from either Ms. Brooks or Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8548)|
| 2:22:32| in terms of what Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8552)|
| 2:22:35| is attempting to motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8555)|
| 2:22:40| Do you wanna eliminate the 25 foot buffer easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8560)|
| 2:22:45| or the 25 foot common area buffer strip?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8565)|
| 2:22:46| Well, I don't really see the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8566)|
| 2:22:49| to eliminate that buffer easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| since engineering has said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| they don't consider those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| to be a double fronted lot with the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| Well, and I want somebody to tell me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8581)|
| 2:23:06| what other impact that has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8586)|
| 2:23:10| I think that you all need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| That is engineering's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| they're sharing the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8594)|
| 2:23:16| of the county law director there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8596)|
| 2:23:19| but there's still a reference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| to the common area buffer strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| as part of the variances there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8603)|
| 2:23:25| and Mr. Wise can correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8605)|
| 2:23:27| but I do think that that needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8607)|
| 2:23:29| I don't think it just goes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8609)|
| 2:23:30| based on Mr. Snowden's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8610)|
| 2:23:35| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8615)|
| 2:23:38| Ms. Brooks is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8618)|
| 2:23:39| that engineering is taking a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| but engineering is not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| contrary to Mr. Mullin's suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8626)|
| 2:23:47| they're not responsible for administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8627)|
| 2:23:49| of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| The planning commission is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8631)|
| 2:23:52| and their conclusion that this is a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8632)|
| 2:23:55| where this is a double furnished lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| really is not compelling upon you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8638)|
| 2:24:01| You need to make that determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| based upon contents of the subdivision regs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8643)|
| 2:24:08| and I don't reach the same conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8648)|
| 2:24:12| that Mr. Mullin has reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| nor the engineering or county law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| It appears to me that it'd be hard to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8659)|
| 2:24:22| that the interstate is not a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8662)|
| 2:24:24| I don't know how you can reach that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| And the provision he suggested in paragraph four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| saying that it only applies to collector or tier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8670)|
| 2:24:32| that's just designed to identify the depth of the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| because there's also provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| referencing local streets that identifies a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| The subdivision regs say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8681)|
| 2:24:43| double furnished lots are to be avoided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| It doesn't define them or exclude the interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| So in order to move forward with some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| to show this is not as a double furnished lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| this body needs to make that determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| not rely upon representations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| from the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| or from the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| It needs to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8703)|
| 2:25:04| I don't think that's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8704)|
| 2:25:06| with the way I read the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8706)|
| 2:25:07| and this body needs to be comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| with the conclusion that they reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8710)|
| 2:25:12| that it is consistent with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| Surprisingly, there's no definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8716)|
| 2:25:18| for a double furnished lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8718)|
| 2:25:19| but certainly nowhere in the body of the document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| does it exclude interstate highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| as not being a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8726)|
| 2:25:27| And that would be necessary to reach that conclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| that this isn't a double furnished lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| because it does describe as Mike did earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8732)|
| 2:25:38| it's anything that sits between two streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| that do not intersect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| And an interstate is either a street or it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8742)|
| 2:25:45| And I'm not sure how you get to that conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| All right, let me revise my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8748)|
| 2:25:54| to say I make a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8754)|
| 2:25:59| let me find my paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| to approve variance one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8760)|
| 2:26:04| and exclude variance two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| dealing with the double furnished lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| and right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| And to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8773)|
| 2:26:20| design standards one through three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8781)|
| 2:26:30| I'm gonna ask staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8790)|
| 2:26:34| does there need to be a reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| for eliminating item number two on the variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8798)|
| 2:26:44| Does Commissioner Roth need to provide a reason for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8804)|
| 2:26:48| or can he make this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8808)|
| 2:26:50| we'll be done with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8810)|
| 2:26:51| Well, I think in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8811)|
| 2:26:52| the elevation of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8812)|
| 2:26:55| and it being the interstate on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| it's my opinion that it shouldn't apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| as it does to other double furnished lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| and other subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| That might be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8825)|
| 2:27:07| Is there a second to Commissioner Roth's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| I had made a second initially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| but I feel that it does warrant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| I think that there are certain good reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8837)|
| 2:27:20| to grant the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8840)|
| 2:27:22| So I withdraw my second to Mr. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8842)|
| 2:27:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8845)|
| 2:27:29| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| Second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8851)|
| 2:27:36| Ms. Karen, you wanna call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8856)|
| 2:27:38| Does everybody understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| I will try to do it the best of my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| So this is dealing with the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8869)|
| 2:27:52| So the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8872)|
| 2:27:54| reduce the minimum vertical curve radius| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8874)|
| 2:27:56| on Hatmaker Lane will continue to stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8876)|
| 2:28:00| And then the alternative design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8880)|
| 2:28:04| one, two, and three would stay in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8884)|
| 2:28:10| Item number two under reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| the 25 foot common area buffer strip would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8893)|
| 2:28:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8897)|
| 2:28:19| And my understanding, Commissioner Roth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8899)|
| 2:28:22| that you're determining that the elevation of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| as well as location along the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| you feel that it's not necessary to have a buffer strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8911)|
| 2:28:35| This is not a double frontage lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8915)|
| 2:28:36| Is that my understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8916)|
| 2:28:38| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8918)|
| 2:28:43| Motion and a second have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| Mr. Mullins, you raised your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8925)|
| 2:28:47| You wanna speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8927)|
| 2:28:48| Yes. I just, I realized through all that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| I never addressed Commissioner Adams' question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8931)|
| 2:28:53| and I apologize about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| And I think the common area for this is the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8937)|
| 2:29:01| there's a significant amount of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8941)|
| 2:29:03| that's undeveloped because of the topography| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8943)|
| 2:29:05| that's gonna remain vacant land under this concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8945)|
| 2:29:10| And I think that might've led to the criticism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8950)|
| 2:29:14| that it wasn't that creative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8954)|
| 2:29:15| but there is quite a bit of vacant land in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| because there's some steep topography as you move north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8958)|
| 2:29:22| And I know what should constitute open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| is something that's being discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| and changing and giving some direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| on the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8972)|
| 2:29:33| but under the current zone and past precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8973)|
| 2:29:37| from planning commission interpreting this zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8977)|
| 2:29:40| then that would be sufficient to constitute open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8980)|
| 2:29:43| I realize that you're not driving right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8983)|
| 2:29:45| but whoever is driving, perhaps it's Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8985)|
| 2:29:48| Can you just draw like on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8988)|
| 2:29:50| that we can see right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| like here is the space that Mr. Mullins is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8991)|
| 2:29:54| that is undeveloped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8994)|
| 2:29:58| And just to clarify, Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| you're saying that it's not a detention pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| it's like open space that's not being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9005)|
| 2:30:08| So it's trees and grass and-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9008)|
| 2:30:10| Trees and grass and ridge top and topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9010)|
| 2:30:13| yes, as it heads north up the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9013)|
| 2:30:20| Is there anything, whoever is using the cursor now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9020)|
| 2:30:23| thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9023)|
| 2:30:24| Is there anything that's in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9024)|
| 2:30:25| like there's some darker gray spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9025)|
| 2:30:27| that are kind of between the cul-de-sac areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| Are those also undeveloped or is that something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9031)|
| 2:30:35| Yeah, there's kind of dark gray spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| I'll just address that real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9040)|
| 2:30:42| Those are the proposed grading lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9042)|
| 2:30:44| So that would be portions of their grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9044)|
| 2:30:46| the part, the other gray or the other lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9046)|
| 2:30:49| that are lighter gray or areas that they don't propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9049)|
| 2:30:52| to grade at least as part of this initial grading package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9052)|
| 2:30:56| That might change a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9056)|
| 2:30:57| as they get through the permitting stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| but that's kind of their proposed extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9059)|
| 2:31:01| of grading at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| Okay, so it's fair to tell me if this is a fair statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9064)|
| 2:31:08| that the open spaces are not, they're not interior spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| They are all spaces that are on the exterior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| of the primary development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| Yeah, the only other open space I noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9083)|
| 2:31:26| when I was reviewing the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| was at the very entrance of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| And I'm gonna just assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| that that was gonna be for the male facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9090)|
| 2:31:33| but that's just my assumption at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| Okay, Mr. Mullins, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9099)|
| 2:31:41| Okay, thanks again for answering my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9101)|
| 2:31:45| All right, we have a motion, a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9105)|
| 2:31:47| Before we move on, Commissioner Easton, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| While we're talking about that undeveloped space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9111)|
| 2:31:53| and I just wanted to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9113)|
| 2:31:55| I think keeping that undeveloped space is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9115)|
| 2:31:59| because if you look at the aerial map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9119)|
| 2:32:02| it looks like that's almost three miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9122)|
| 2:32:05| of continuous ridgeline that's undisturbed in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9125)|
| 2:32:11| As opposed to an isolated section of hilltop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9131)|
| 2:32:14| this is part of a large continuous section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9134)|
| 2:32:18| But also going back, so from that perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9138)|
| 2:32:21| I appreciate the approach the development is taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9141)|
| 2:32:25| But going back to the double-fronted lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9145)|
| 2:32:28| I think I'm having some problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9148)|
| 2:32:30| with the double-fronted lot issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9150)|
| 2:32:31| because I want to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9151)|
| 2:32:32| with how we address double-fronted lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9152)|
| 2:32:34| And I think the other thing that's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9154)|
| 2:32:37| about the double-fronted lots is to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9157)|
| 2:32:39| that we don't end up with street corners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| that are lined on either side with fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| because the backyards are so close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9166)|
| 2:32:49| That may not be the case in this particular instance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| because of some of the existing interstate trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9172)|
| 2:32:55| but it could be the case in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9175)|
| 2:32:57| And I think that's why it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9177)|
| 2:32:58| Although I appreciate what the development has done so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9178)|
| 2:33:02| with that undeveloped space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9182)|
| 2:33:03| I'm concerned about not holding up the double-fronted lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9183)|
| 2:33:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9189)|
| 2:33:11| Ms. Karen, there's no other comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9191)|
| 2:33:13| so if you call the roll, please, on the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9193)|

| 2:33:22| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9202)|

| 2:33:25| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9205)|

| 2:33:47| Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9227)|

| 2:34:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9246)|
| 2:34:16| Is there a motion on the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan with the nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210211?start=9259)|
