| 0:01:20| Welcome to the Board of Education's July 14th regular session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=80)|

| 0:01:40| Ms. Babb is out of town and I think Mr. McMillan will be joining us shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=100)|
| 0:01:47| A reminder to the board members that our next policy review meeting will be held on Wednesday, July 21st at 1.30 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson Boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=107)|
| 0:01:58| The Joint Education Committee is also scheduled to meet on Wednesday, July 21st at 4 p.m. in the Andrew Johnson Building Boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=118)|
| 0:02:08| Board members, you received an email yesterday regarding the addition of item 6C17, which is a request from Fairgood High School to approve an agreement for their use of Project Lead the Way curriculum and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=128)|
| 0:02:22| If there are questions or discussion, they can be entertained prior to our vote on the consent agenda items, and please note that there is a new version of that contract attached to your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=142)|
| 0:02:37| Are there any other requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| Okay, do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| We have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second by Ms. Satterfield. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| And now I'd like to refer to Superintendent Thomas for a special recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=177)|
| 0:03:01| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the Board. This activity is one that I have the most fun with every time we do it, just recognizing the members of our outstanding family that do outstanding things for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=181)|
| 0:03:12| So we know that when students are hungry, it's much harder to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| Tonight, I want to recognize a group of people who work very hard to eliminate this obstacle for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| The organization No Kid Hungry Tennessee has recently highlighted the KCS nutrition team for their work, including the presentation of a school meal hero plaque.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=203)|
| 0:03:33| Our Executive Director of School Nutrition, Brett Foster, has invited several of our school nutrition team members to join us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| So I would ask that Brett and her team come forward at this time, if you would, make your way to up front here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=219)|
| 0:03:47| Don't hesitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| Come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| As they make their way to the stage, I do want to briefly point out that our nutrition workers do an outstanding job every year providing breakfast and lunch meals to students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=232)|
| 0:03:59| But in the last 18 months, they have gone far beyond the call of duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| In the spring of 2020, they organized a drive-thru meal service, and these meals were an essential resource for many families during the early weeks of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=243)|
| 0:04:11| More recently, they reorganized our meal process to reflect new health and safety procedures for in-person students and to provide meals for virtual students during the 2021 school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=251)|
| 0:04:21| And during our summer learning camps that just ended, our team continued to provide bagged meals that could be distributed to our campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| Like all of us, I'm sure that Brett and her team are looking forward to a more normal school year this fall, and I'm confident that one thing will not change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| and that's the dedication, skill, and compassion of our nutrition workers will continue to be an enormous blessing to our students and our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| Please join me in recognizing our outstanding school nutrition team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=283)|
| 0:04:48| Fort Mellers, if you would join up, we'll take a group picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=288)|
| 0:05:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=318)|
| 0:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=352)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you all so much for being here this evening and for all your hard work over the past year plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=370)|
| 0:06:17| We appreciate you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| We recognize a great group of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| Okay, and Ms. Coatney will have the reading of the agenda items, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=385)|
| 0:06:29| Madam Chair, before we read consent agenda, we have three public forum speakers that have registered to speak to Item 6c3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=389)|
| 0:06:38| The first speaker is Kevin Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| Mr. Hill, just a reminder that you have five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| And please state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| for the record before you start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=412)|
| 0:06:53| Kevin Hill, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| I know that you all have on your agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| tonight to consider a memorandum of agreement with the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| County Health Department so that Dr. Buchanan would serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| as the supervising physician for the nurses in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| I also know that that has been historically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| a soft agreement without any formal paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| I would encourage you to postpone that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=437)|
| 0:07:22| That was a request by the county official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| It's not been approved by her supervising body, the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| commission, which will happen this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| If it was something that she needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| to be formalized before school begins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| then it would have needed to have been formalized before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| the previous school years began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| So the argument that it should happen before school begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| is moot and irrelevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| However, we do have a problem with an official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| who's currently under, her department's currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| under audit for misappropriation of funds or resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| We also have an individual who has proven herself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| to be more and more out of step with what the science suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| regarding children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| She stood here a few months ago and was in direct conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| with an expert you called in, Dr. Childs, who clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| contradicted her advice to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| Why would you invite her back as a supervising physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| to continue giving advice when she has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| she's actually, her expertise since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| she's not been a practicing physician for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| but her expertise is on the extreme end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| She was a geriatric physician prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| to being an administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| So why not bring in someone like Dr. Childs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| or put out and request one of the many hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| pediatric groups that are apart from Children's Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| to serve in this capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| There's questions as to whether, and you all would have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| I think we would like to hear you quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| because we've looked for where there is a law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| and you all have said there is, so I assume there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| we just would like you to inform us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| where there is a law that actually requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| a direct physician over the nurses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| rather than simply them serving the capacity that they serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| as nurses that has some independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| under their licensure, under the supervision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| of the child's own physician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| How the child's own physician doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| satisfy that requirement if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| acting on the directions of serving medication and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| like that, that the child's physician has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| prescribed for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| So we would appreciate you making that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| because we've not found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| Doesn't mean it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| We're just not, those of us who've been looking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| haven't found where there is a legal requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| So just as a sincere ask, please share that with us tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| so that we can understand that regulation better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| But the main point is there's no reason, if for years past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| we've not needed a formal memorandum of agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=596)|
| 0:10:00| and it's been perfectly satisfactory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| then I can't imagine why, for school to start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| we need one now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| And it would be wise to wait and see what the county does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=605)|
| 0:10:08| next week in response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| And I think it should be appropriate for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| reviewing her as a potential supervisor over any program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| that, while her department is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| under an investigation, that, quite frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| while we don't have hard evidence of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| now, until we know, doesn't rule out the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| of criminal violations, until that's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| she shouldn't have any additional new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| responsibilities extended to her in any kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| of formalized agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| And now we have Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| If you'll just state your name and county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=649)|
| 0:10:57| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| My name is Sherry Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| I was very concerned when I saw that there was supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=663)|
| 0:11:06| to be an appointment of medical director of Dr. Martha Buchanan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| as the medical director of the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| Dr. Buchanan has had a family practice past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| but that has been many years ago since she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| has served in her capacity as the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| director and as public health officer in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| She does not have a pediatric background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=685)|
| 0:11:27| She does not have, in my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| the certification that many family practice positions have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| to obtain in order to see pediatric patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| Knox County schools do not have adults attending their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| They have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| And children have special needs, different needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| other than what adults have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| I've been a nurse for most of the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| And in my practice, or in my positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| in both in the hospital, in doctor's offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| and in long-term care facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| we have practiced autonomously with a doctor's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| These children come in with medications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| they need to have per their physician's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| their pediatrician's orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=726)|
| 0:12:08| If a child is, for example, paralyzed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| and needs to be catheterized, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=731)|
| 0:12:12| comes with their doctor's orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| And these nurses perform these tests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=734)|
| 0:12:16| and have been doing it for many years in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=736)|
| 0:12:21| I don't feel that Dr. Buchanan is the appropriate person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| to be heading this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| I would highly recommend that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| look at other physicians, other physicians, pediatricians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| in this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=751)|
| 0:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| And now Mr. Vernon Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=755)|
| 0:12:47| Good afternoon, Vernon Henry, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| First time I've been before the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| Your job's to oversee the education of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| And yet the very job that you've been put in charge of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=779)|
| 0:13:03| you seem to be wanting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=783)|
| 0:13:05| You're going to put an individual, as others have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| who's in investigation for whatever the case may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| be at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| We're still waiting to find out what those charges are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| This is not a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Has anybody on this board at all vetted this individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=798)|
| 0:13:24| that you want to put in charge of Knox County's children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| Raise a hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| Mr. Henry, this is not a back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| I know it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| But raising a hand is a real simple aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| So the reality is I don't think anybody's vetted her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| The individual's care for handling Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| has been questionable at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| And now we want her to run, oversee our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| I would ask you to push this vote to the wayside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| until you can basically vet this individual or other individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=834)|
| 0:14:00| who are more appropriate for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Because after all, the very, very people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=844)|
| 0:14:10| you have been elected to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=850)|
| 0:14:13| are indeed your responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| You put the parents in a precarious situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| because you put them at odds with Knox County Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| This woman has a history of not knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=863)|
| 0:14:27| the difference between science fiction and science fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| I brought those up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| Many of us in our group have actually brought that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| I'd like you to take a look at it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| Before you bring somebody in, please vet them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Because at the end of the day, this is our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| These are Knox County's children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| And it's your job to make sure that, in fact, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| are ensuring you have the best to look after these kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| With that, I'll relinquish my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| And that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=903)|
| 0:15:06| Mr. David, would you mind just reviewing the code that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=906)|
| 0:15:11| requires us to have a medical director over our nurses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| before we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| I was looking for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| I had mentioned that at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| There was at least one section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| And I don't seem to, I was looking for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| in my materials tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| So I don't seem to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=929)|
| 0:15:31| But I can certainly supplement with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| more comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| But I mean, I personally looked at one section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| that talked about needing a medical director, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| for an organization like Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| Now, as to the rest of the comments, I can't speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=951)|
| 0:15:51| Yeah, we did cover that, I know, two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| when we were here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=954)|
| 0:15:55| OK, thank you, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| Item six, consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Do we have a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=961)|
| 0:16:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| If somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| So we have a motion to pull this item off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| OK, we have a motion by Ms. Christie, a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| No discussion, I'm sorry, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Just to move it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Are you in agreement with moving it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| OK, OK, so all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| OK, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| So we'll move that to the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Would that be appropriate to the very end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| So do we have a motion to, I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| ask for a motion for consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| For the balance of consent, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Mr. Watson made a motion, do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| We have a second by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1021)|

| 0:24:34| I'm not going to holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1474)|
| 0:24:35| But we're going into another school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And the still chief of security, I didn't say no name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| is still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| And it's still going to pick more officers that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| want blacks in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| 45 gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| So you think I'm going to tell some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| of my people in the community, go apply and go get on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| if you're going to waste your time and not be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| That's what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| You said, we want you to trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| But you won't even sit down with us to talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| We're not saying that we don't want police, our school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| being secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| But your school security should be so strengthened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| and so with the right people and the right personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| that you don't need the sheriff's department in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| You don't need KPD in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| But because you have them in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| is because school security ain't really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| ready for what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1529)|
| 0:25:31| Never have been ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| I trained with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| They're not ready for what might happen in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| The officer that you had ran and left that boy in the bathroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| and knew he was in the bathroom the whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| But we blame the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| But we didn't put the blame where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| My kids go to Selmore Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| Hour and 30 minutes it took for KPD to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| School security should have been the first one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1552)|
| 0:25:54| That's why they got the cars and the lights to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1554)|
| 0:25:59| I shouldn't get a call at my house, where you at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1559)|
| 0:26:01| because this is going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| I had to go buy my kids a $249 backpack, a bulletproof backpack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| to put on just in case something happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| I come to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1571)|
| 0:26:11| I come to the school officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| They haven't called me back on, let's talk about this backpack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| and see what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| We have a Secret Service agent that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| saying, I will come down and show the backpack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| show you how you can get it for half the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| I didn't get no call back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| They don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Sometimes I don't think it's that you don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Sometimes I don't think it's not racism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| I think what it is, is some of y'all are warm percenters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| and y'all don't care because it doesn't happen to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I live in Holston Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| I'm almost out of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| I live in Holston Hills, up on top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| And I stay more in the inner city than I stay at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| My wife gets on me all the time because I stay more down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| trying to fix the problems because you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1606)|
| 0:26:50| I said I was retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| I'm not retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1611)|
| 0:26:53| I'm going to stay right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1613)|

| 0:26:56| I'm going to keep calling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1616)|
| 0:26:57| I'm going to keep emailing until you hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| We need a community forum about this memorandum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1620)|

| 0:27:13| with the Knoxville Police Department regarding roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| and responsibilities for maintaining safe schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| I'm sorry, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| We have other speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1640)|
| 0:27:21| And I'm not sure if they may be signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| for just the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| No, we only have one other person signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| to speak about us for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1650)|
| 0:27:40| We had someone call the board office today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| and say that they may come to the meeting early and sign up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| But they did not come to the meeting before we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| Our policy is that you can call till 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| the day prior to the meeting or arrive prior to our meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| and sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| And we don't have anybody else that signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| So Madam Chair, if I would like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| to suspend the rules, because they're students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| and they were here at the time, but they probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| didn't know the process itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| So I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| to hear them on the aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| OK, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| OK, all in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1704)|
| 0:28:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Do we have, so we have what, about eight or nine students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Kaniyia, how many students do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1716)|
| 0:28:45| Four, OK, we have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| All right, go ahead and come on up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you for the four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1729)|
| 0:29:05| If you'll just state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| Chloe Pearson, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| It's been exactly three months since the killing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| of Anthony Thompson, Jr., three months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| that a mother has gone without her child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| three months that siblings have gone without their brother,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| and three months that friends have gone without somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| very dear to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Why has no justice been served when everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| you have to build a case was put in the body cam footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Y'all want to constantly throw out that aunt had a gun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| but have yet to investigate why he had one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| why he went to go get one, why he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| felt unprotected without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| This was a young man who lost an uncle to gun violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| and not to mention a close friend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| when he was only 12 or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| Also, let's not forget about how months prior to his killing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| he lost multiple classmates to gun violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| So let me ask y'all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Why do these kids feel not protected enough by KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| that they take matters into their own hands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| Why are these kids more scared of the police than each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| Why did y'all think that it was OK| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| to let those police officers into the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| without even informing Anthony's mother first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1821)|
| 0:30:25| There's 10 million more questions that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1825)|
| 0:30:27| but I shouldn't have to ask because it wasn't right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| and y'all know it wasn't right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| But we will scream justice for aunt until something is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| and I don't care if that means screaming it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| into my last breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| Next student, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1840)|

| 0:31:04| The job of a police officer is supposed to protect and serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| but on April 12, 2021, they did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| They killed Anthony Thompson, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| This topic is never going to die down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| and Bob Thomas, for you to ask that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| that just means you don't have my classmates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| and our best interests at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| If you did, this MOA wouldn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| be in discussion right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| The MOA is now just a paper with words written on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| that doesn't hold any form because on April 12, 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| these guidelines weren't followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| So as a student in Austin East, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| ask that you don't dismiss my existence, my anger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| and my well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| And when you come to visit my school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I ask that you acknowledge me and my peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| as well, and require SORs and KPD to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| And lastly, I would like for you to know that your frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| is no more than mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Next student, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Just state your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1913)|
| 0:32:11| Sequoia Sanders, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| To claim the name as a Roadrunner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| is a really hard task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| People expect you not to be an upstanding person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| and not to speak up when it's time to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| From April 12 to now, the way things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1943)|
| 0:32:25| have been handled through the Knox County School Board, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| SROs, and Knox County Sheriff's Department are unjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Nobody should be comfortable with being frustrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| with somebody else's trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| Bob Thomas, I'm beginning to question if you really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1960)|
| 0:32:46| Do you really have our well-being at heart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| As a superintendent, you should be on the side of the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1969)|
| 0:32:55| and be trying to get the students' point of view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| and trying to understand what happened to Anthony Thompson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Jr. and the trauma that came behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1981)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| OK, we have the next student, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| Is there another student?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=1999)|
| 0:33:29| My name is Kanaya Hutchison in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| April 12, Anthony was killed in his school's bathroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| April 21, just nine days later, Bob Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| sent us back to school with metal detectors, wands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| and searches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| Each officer greeted me that day just nine days later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| with a smile on their face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Same day, Bob Thomas handed my teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| a packet that was filled with information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| on how to handle a mass shooting in which we didn't experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| Therapists to our class who were there for support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| but none of which knew exactly what we were going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Beginning April 12 to now, Bob Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| it seemed as if you never had the attention to change things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| for Austin's behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| Three months later, you're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| asking for us to move on from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| and you have yet to actually address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| No parent's meetings have been formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| no communication with you and students have been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| and no mental health issues have been advocated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| through the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| You asked us to move on like the trauma isn't still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| The tears aren't still falling, and our school as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| isn't still affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Associate's degree to become an officer in six months training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2073)|
| 0:34:38| is required, especially to de-escalate a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| But that day when Officer Scott opened that door for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| to walk in on Anthony Thompson Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| that was not put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| And for you to only come into Austinese| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| and stand at the entrance without having a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| with the student makes you just as bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| as the SROs, KPD, and the Knoxville Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| As a student at Austinese, I ask that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| y'all make decisions for my classmates and I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| which I am just a senior, a couple years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| I will not go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2112)|
| 0:35:12| A year from now, I won't be there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| and people under me will still be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| I ask that certain things change on behalf of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| I only have to deal with it for one more year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| and then I'm off to Spelman for college.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| But my classmates still have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| His parents still have to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| and everybody else still have to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| When y'all go home at night, y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| don't have to deal with this at all, but I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| Them four girls over there, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Our teachers do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Y'all didn't even acknowledge how our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| were affected by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Yes, in the past, Austinese has lost teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| but this year, we lost more than enough teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2148)|
| 0:35:52| and not just admin included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| I know this year, it's more admin been put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Most of them was at Vine with me my eighth grade year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| and I loved them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| From Ms. White to Mr. Black to Ms. Hawkins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| being my science eighth grade teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| That still doesn't change what went on in my school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| And Bob Thomas, you came into my school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| literally walked right past me, and didn't say a thing to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| after everything happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| I talked to Ms. White about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| She said that you wanted to speak with us, KCOO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| but you did not take the initiative to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| or speak to any of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| In March, well, in February, when Stan had died, afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2182)|
| 0:36:26| it was teachers and our officers in our school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| going on two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| After that, that was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| My classmates and I, we actually spoke at a city council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| that was held by Constance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| And we asked for metal detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| We asked for the stuff that y'all put into place after Anthony died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| If y'all would have put the stuff that we asked for in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| none of this could have happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| Anthony still could be walking in Austinese like I am, my senior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| I can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you, student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| We have a motion first, so we can have discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2235)|
| 0:37:16| We have a motion by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| We have a second by Ms. Christie, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| OK, we have a motion and a second, so discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| Ms. Satterfield, do you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| The MOA that we have in place, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| be passing on this vote, just on the strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| I understand the level of why we need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2258)|
| 0:37:43| and the angst that's in the community because of how we even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| got here with having to create a whole new MOA due to outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2266)|
| 0:37:51| parties' decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| And so I understand that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| But for me, I can't vote on it because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| the same words that was on the papers in the previous MOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| And I'm just looking for change behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| Higher expectations from Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| and people held accountable, be it in positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| be it whatever it may be, for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| harm is caused to our kids in any aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| And I know last week's board meeting was just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2299)|
| 0:38:23| things were said and a lot was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| But I also work with you all closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| We have other conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| And I know that we're all just trying to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| And I know you, Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| trying to figure it out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| None of us have experienced this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| I think where we have dropped the ball as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| including myself, is that we haven't shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2320)|
| 0:38:42| the compassion side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2322)|
| 0:38:43| We've been lost in the policy and the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| and the procedures of it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| And that could just be the fear from wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| to talk out about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2330)|
| 0:38:51| It could be the fear from, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| are wrapped up in litigation and we can't speak about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2336)|
| 0:38:56| But I just ask for us to have a level of understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| of what people are going through and experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| And so as much as people are, that were at angst about KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| being pulled out of our schools, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| just as many people with angst about them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| coming back into our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| So I know everyone's heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| I know, well, I believe I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| And I know that we're just all, how we got here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| we never experienced it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| And how we got to this point, it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2362)|
| 0:39:27| influenced by a lot of outside parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| that just kind of threw it all out of whack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| from my perspective and my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| And so I look forward to us moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| learning from this experience these last couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| The new chief of security coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| and really taking heed regarding how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| we operate to make sure that our kids do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| feel safe in their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| And that means many different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| So I look forward to continue to work with the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| and work with you, Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| to make that a reality for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| Don't apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2400)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| First, I just want to say thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| to our young ladies, our students, who came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2404)|
| 0:40:07| and really expressed yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2407)|
| 0:40:11| And I appreciate the vulnerability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| I can't see you right now because I'm trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| to talk into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| But that's why I agree with Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2416)|
| 0:40:22| I think that's what's not been able to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| over the last few months, not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| around the situation with Anthony and his death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| in that school that day, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| been many, many parents and students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| over the years who have suffered traumatic events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| And the intent of bringing this up back in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2439)|
| 0:40:45| was for the board to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| to hear from the community in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| that it maybe hasn't heard from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| in a very proactive way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I mean, that was the intent, was to be proactive and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| we want you to come to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| The intent also was to review the entirety of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| MOA that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| And what's happened along the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| is this board has consistently said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| we need to review the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| I mean, I've continued to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Maybe some other folks have not, but I've heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| I've also continued to hear, we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2478)|
| 0:41:19| We have not come to agreement about how that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| But that's also been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| But what we're looking at tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| is an MOA that actually we didn't even prompt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| The changes that are in this MOA, I think there's roughly six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| were prompted by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| I mean, Mr. Thomas, you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2495)|
| 0:41:38| but I believe you sat down with KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2498)|
| 0:41:40| to start discussions about how to keep them engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| And KPD said, hey, here's some changes we want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2509)|
| 0:41:49| And so right now, what we're looking at potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| approving is not an MOA that KCS has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| or the board has said, hey, here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| what we think needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Here's what we believe needs to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| because what we've heard from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| and our teachers, and our administrators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| What we're hearing is from a partner, KPD, to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| here's what we think needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| And what they've expressed is the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| And they've said, even for us to stay at the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| this is what needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| So just think about this for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| We're potentially approving something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| that everybody agrees is the very least that should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| At the very, very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| And maybe not everybody agrees that, but that's at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| it's kind of like enough to wet the pallet to say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| maybe I can vote for this or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| And so what I want to do tonight is try to honor the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| And again, what I've consistently heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| is it does need to be reviewed, and we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| need to have community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| And again, the intent was to review the entirety of the MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| which has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| It's not been a proactive thing that KCS has engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Superintendent Thomas, I think rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| felt like, hey, I've got to have a plan to open schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| and have security kind of figured out and thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| So I want to propose a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| I want to propose, and Ms. Coatney has this for everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| so they can look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2592)|
| 0:43:13| I want to move to approve 9b because I do think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2593)|
| 0:43:18| the intent of it is, let's move something forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| And it's not where we need to move to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| but it's at least an inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| With the expectation, I'm sorry, actually, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2605)|
| 0:43:30| have not the wording that I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Can you give me that paper as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| I have my old wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| Yeah, so move to approve item 9b with the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| and authorization for the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| to work with other named entities in the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| So there would be two, if this gets approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| it would be then two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| There was one with KCSO and one with KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| To combine the separate MOAs with Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Office and the Knoxville Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| into one MOA, leveraging input from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| and other stakeholder groups, and present a proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| combined MOA for board approval within the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| So our first MOA with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| and KPD and KCSO was drafted and approved in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| And up until this point, never have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| we thought it was a good precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2666)|
| 0:44:28| to have two separate MOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| The only reason, again, this has been proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| isn't because KCSO said, hey, it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| to have two separate MOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| It was done out of necessity and KPD saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| for us to stay at the table, we got to see something change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| And here's the minimum of what we think needs to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| So this approved and authorized Bob and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2685)|
| 0:44:51| to work with those entities to get back to a unified MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| which, again, I think there can be a lot of challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| about having two different ones, especially as you have teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| moving across from county schools to city schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| or you have parents who have a kid with special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2703)|
| 0:45:07| in a city school, and then next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| they're in a county school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| I think there's all kinds of challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| with having two different MOAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| And again, in this proposal, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| not a process for it hearing from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| but it is saying in that agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| as we get to that agreement, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| would hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| And obviously, that would need to be figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| But I want to offer this up as a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| Mr. Irwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2735)|
| 0:45:36| And Ms. Satterfield, you made the original motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| so is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| So I'm offering it as a friendly motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| OK, so we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| All right, did you have something, Ms. Irwin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| So we are discussing the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| Because the, I appreciate this very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2759)|
| 0:46:06| I think it puts in place a lot of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2766)|
| 0:46:11| we need for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| There's one disagreement that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| In the MOA, as it's written, it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| that it will be reviewed at the end of each semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2781)|
| 0:46:26| So I would like to see this say six months instead of 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Unless they feel that's too short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| Yeah, from a wording standpoint, I'm amenable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| I did catch that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| And I do think it's important for the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2802)|
| 0:46:43| to note that if we do approve the MOA as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| we are agreeing to review it every six months, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| this one, not the one with KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| So I think that's important to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2811)|
| 0:46:55| OK, is six months enough time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| Does it need to be 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| Mr. Thomas, Mr. Oaks, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| So she's saying to change this to within the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| rather than 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| I think we can make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| Russ, I don't know, you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| I think, given where we are, more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| is better than less time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| Also, my understanding going into the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| is that the six month review is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| an operational review between our folks and the KPD's folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| about the occurrences during that particular semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| or during that time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| It is not intended to be a full blown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2871)|
| 0:47:55| review of every piece of the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| At least that was my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| from our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| Thank you, Mr. Oaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| I am OK with 12 months or six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2886)|
| 0:48:09| but I think this also brings out another piece of the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2889)|
| 0:48:13| with both of these MOAs, is that it's not clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2893)|
| 0:48:17| And when it says review, it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| say an operational review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| And there are so many pieces here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| that are like that, that are unclear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| And in each MOA, it says that the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| is to lay out guidelines so that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2909)|
| 0:48:31| knows exactly what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2911)|
| 0:48:34| But then those guidelines don't clarify exactly what to expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| So anything that we could do to make this one item as soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2918)|
| 0:48:47| as possible, I think would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2929)|
| 0:48:49| Thank you, Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| So the intent, the reason I brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| as a substitute motion was not that last paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| But I think this needs to happen even if that paragraph was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2940)|
| 0:49:03| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| I did want to just point the board to a wording issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| that I have with it that I'm not going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| to ask for it to be changed because I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| too laborious at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| But I do want us to be conscious about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| when we're drafting these types of documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| N.7 under D, so D7, where it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| SROs will not intercede in any incident involving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| a special needs student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| I would really like to center students first and say things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| like students with special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Again, for some folks, it feels minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| But I have the same issue when we say homeless persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2982)|
| 0:49:42| I just think we need to be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| conscious in our language in making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| that we're centering the person before any characteristic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| might describe that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| So again, I'm not asking for a word change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| I know that would have to go back to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| and all those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| But I do just want to elevate that as a thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| as we move forward and look at language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| and be really thoughtful of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| Even though it's a contractual agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| and it's not meant as a marketing piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| I still think we need to be thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| And well, first, maybe if we could explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3014)|
| 0:50:20| the process of how we got to the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| as far as who all is at the table and the back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| between the different law departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| to come to the agreements that we have gotten to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| And then the other is, has anyone had any discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| with the new security chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3040)|
| 0:50:41| I'm curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| I mean, I'm not opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| Just as a board member, I'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| say that this is already my expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3048)|
| 0:50:53| We hire the superintendent and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| hires his staff to do a certain job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3056)|
| 0:50:59| And I already have the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| that this will be discussed with the new security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| chief and the different law enforcement agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| I mean, again, I'm not opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3075)|
| 0:51:15| I mean, I'm fine with these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| I'm just saying, as a board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| I already have this expectation that these discussions will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| Order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So I already have that expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| that that is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Like I said, I'm fine with these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| You know, it kind of feels like we're giving him permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| to do what we're paying him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| But I understand in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| that we need to maybe outline what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| we want to happen because it has become such a hot topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| I just wanted to go on the record saying that that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| already what my expectations were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Ms. Christie, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| And this, in some ways, comes out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| of deference for superintendent's frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| the last time we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I mean, the superintendent, again, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| I may have expressed a fair amount of frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| about just not being clear about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| is expected of him with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| And I even brought up the comment last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| or I think it was actually two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| We're a little bit off rhythm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Two weeks ago about, if we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| does this shut the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| I mean, I asked that question, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| think, superintendent, you said not in your mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| necessarily, that you would still be open to hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3174)|
| 0:52:55| So this is one last attempt to give the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| some direction to move forward when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| I feel like he's expressed pretty directly that he doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| feel like he has clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| But again, superintendent, feel free to chime in or correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| That's correct, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| And certainly, I have no issues with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| It's what the board approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| I agree that two MOAs, it would be better to have one, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| And depending on what happens this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| talk with the sheriff about these changes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| But I think, like I said, a facilitator would have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3209)|
| 0:53:35| probably the better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| But hey, we'll make it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| If you approve this, then we're going to do everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| We're committed to making it one agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| We're committed to, and I'm committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| to, getting community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| If you want to just leave that up to us as to how we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3228)|
| 0:53:51| then we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| And we'll keep you informed as to how we're going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| And if you say, you don't want community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| from your district, you know what they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| we'll work with you individually as to what you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| to get that community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| And I know the new chief, too, said something maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| about some town hall meetings and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| So I know he wants to kind of get his legs under him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| once he gets here and figure things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| I think he'll have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| He sat in on a meeting with us, with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| So I'm sure he's probably been keeping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| with things from a distance at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| since he's coming here in the next couple of weeks and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| So I'm certainly, we're comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| And if you approve it, then that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| what we'll work toward and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| I guess my question would be for the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| to begin with, knowing that this was coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| and the fact that school will begin in less than a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3290)|
| 0:54:58| and we need something in place, have you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| or members of your staff had conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| with the sheriff's department to find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| what their expectations are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| No, like I said a couple weeks ago, I think, on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| And if the board approves it, that'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| be my next step, too, is to talk with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| But this, basically, what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3321)|
| 0:55:23| is to get us back to where we were before the city pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| out of the, or said they were going to pull out of the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| So this, at least, gets us back to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| If board approves this, then next conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| would have with the sheriff and talk with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| about those changes and see what their feeling is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| But I think if you vote to approve this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| then that's all under review with all the agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| sheriff's department and police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| and with us in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| But if we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| The sheriff still operates under the current agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3360)|
| 0:56:04| So basically, either way, until there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| some one agreement reached, provided that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3368)|
| 0:56:17| then we would have officers, KPD officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3377)|
| 0:56:24| in all the city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| In the middle schools and high schools, secondary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3390)|
| 0:56:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3391)|
| 0:56:32| But that, it kind of bothers me about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3392)|
| 0:56:41| it's a little bit vague about how you're going to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| meeting with the community and getting community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| But in the past, without getting into any individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3410)|
| 0:56:59| or personalities here, I'm just talking about historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| When the city, county, particularly in something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| of this nature, I mean, when I say of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| I'm talking about law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| I'm not talking about parks or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| They've, either one side or the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3443)|
| 0:57:25| has been, I guess for lack of a better term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| rather cantankerous as far as reaching a unified agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3448)|
| 0:57:35| And I don't know if we can get into that here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| But, well, if we didn't, if you couldn't reach an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3461)|
| 0:57:48| then would, do you have assurance from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| that they will leave their officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| in the middle and high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3476)|
| 0:57:59| Well, I think my understanding is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3479)|
| 0:58:02| that if the board approves this, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| they will until there is a new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| That wasn't what I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3487)|
| 0:58:08| So what are you, I'm not asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Who did you talk to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3492)|
| 0:58:13| The mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| Yes, talked to the mayor and Chief Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| Did she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| Well, did the two of them tell you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| Or did you all even discuss what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3500)|
| 0:58:23| happen if the board didn't approve this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Or if something happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| No, we didn't discuss if the board didn't approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| So you're just basically assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| that they would continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Well, they again made the changes to the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| under the conditions and changes that they made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| They said they would do, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| have the officers in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| So I have to go on the word that was provided by the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| I understand what you're saying, but there was many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| It wasn't like these are the changes that we won't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| and you'll have our support for the full year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| Again, I don't have that in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| That was my understanding, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| that the officers are going to be there for the school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| based on the fact that the board would approve this MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| I guess since you didn't specifically ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| and they didn't state it, I see what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3559)|
| 0:59:26| You would naturally assume that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| I would hope they wouldn't decide for whatever reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| to remove them just because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3577)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Just to Mr. McMillan's point, I think some of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| is addressed in conclusion on the page five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| where the city, I think, is committing to this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| until a new one at some point at some time is reached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| I think they're saying, hey, if this gets approved, we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| Also, I think the 12-month time frame helps some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| I know Ms. Babb is not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| but I know she referenced at our meeting two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| about really wanting to get the new chief involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| let him get his feet under him, and all that kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| and let him be a part of whatever that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| engagement process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| So I think this gives time for the new chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3615)|
| 1:00:18| to be fully engaged in whatever happens moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3623)|
| 1:00:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| I think I have a clarifying question for Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Are you asking, are you saying that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| would like for them to have a minimum commitment of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3635)|
| 1:00:39| so that they say, if we agree to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| we will stick with it for this minimum amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| That would have been my hope in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3651)|
| 1:00:56| I would have thought that it would have come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| because it may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| It might just be that they can work everything out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| But somehow or another, I think that, and I might be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3665)|
| 1:01:15| that getting the Sheriff's Department and the city mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3675)|
| 1:01:22| and police chief all on the same page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| to a common agreement, I guess I'm just a little skeptical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3687)|
| 1:01:38| I guess, is the best I can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| Maybe we could ask Mr. Thomas to just ask the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| to commit for a minimum amount of time for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| year, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I'll be glad to talk with Mayor Kincaid about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| I think, should this approve, that minimum time frame should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| be 12 months, if this gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3720)|
| 1:02:03| And I think, Mr. McMillan, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3723)|
| 1:02:06| if this substitute motion doesn't, if it gets approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| and we cannot get to a single agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I think all this is stating is that the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| and his team are going to be acting in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| But if, for some reason, we can't get to an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| then the two MOAs at that point would stay in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3747)|
| 1:02:27| We'll do our best to try to work with all the entities involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| to come up with one agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| So that's the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| Mr. Watson, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| Given what we've said here, what would you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3764)|
| 1:02:51| think about putting 9B in place for 12 months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| Us calling for it to be there for 12 months, splitting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| and then doing what you want to do here, all this other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3784)|
| 1:03:12| put that as a, if you have 9B in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| that doesn't prohibit any of this other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| from taking place, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3800)|
| 1:03:28| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| I was trying to think about, I appreciate your thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3810)|
| 1:03:34| process there, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| And I think what I was trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| with the intent of keeping them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| is to ensure the public and to make a strong commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3820)|
| 1:03:46| from the board that we desire to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| to a single MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3830)|
| 1:03:51| My concern about separating them is if we end up approving 9B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| and then not approving the additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| then we're back into the same place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| as if we didn't have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| Well, let me tell you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| It may not make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| If you'll split them so that we have 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3851)|
| 1:04:18| now, we could always, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| if you have these community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| we could always add something back to 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| Could we not, Mr. Dupler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| If something came up that needed to be added back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| to the original 9B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| Go ahead, Mr. Capeland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| So the way I understand it, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| this MOA came from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| But the way I understand it is their intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| is that if this is approved, it will stay in effect for KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| until there's another agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| So however long that is, whether that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| 12 months or 18 months or six months or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| So that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| If there's any changes to this agreement, an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| or a wholesale change, it would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| to be agreed to by not only the board, but the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| So does that answer the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| I guess what I was thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| was that we would go ahead and get 9B in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| and it would stay in operation, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| until something else came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| But in the discussion with the community or with anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| if somebody comes up with a suggestion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| would strengthen it and the board and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3960)|
| 1:06:07| could agree on it, then we could add it back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| or in whatever we had coming later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3972)|
| 1:06:19| But until then, we would have that in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3979)|
| 1:06:26| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| What do you think about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| Mr. McMillan, I think what, and correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| I want to make sure I'm tracking what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| You're saying if we go ahead and approve 9B tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| as is, without the additional substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| then if and when we should have any community process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| or if and when somebody should come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| with some better ideas that might strengthen the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| then we could do that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| So I think that I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4021)|
| 1:07:07| And I think that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| The whole purpose in the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| is to guarantee that we're going to relook at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| If we just approve 9B, then there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| no guarantee that we're going to relook at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| And I don't think it gives Mr. Thomas any kind of direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4038)|
| 1:07:22| about how to proceed forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| I'm not comfortable separating 9B from my substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| or that part of it, because I think the approval of 9B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| would need to happen first, because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4052)|
| 1:07:33| don't think you can make a substitute motion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| affects 9B unless it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4055)|
| 1:07:38| And so my vote on 9B might look different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| depending on if we agree to relooking at the entire MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| So if I separate them, then I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| It would affect the way I voted for 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| Well, let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| Have you discussed personally these changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4074)|
| 1:08:01| with Mayor Kincaid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| Which changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Adding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| I have spoken to Mayor Kincaid, and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| about the wording for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| That's what I was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Yeah, I didn't think that would be necessarily appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4095)|
| 1:08:20| to do, because all I'm doing is saying we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| to continue the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| I did speak to Mayor Kincaid about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| she is still willing to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| And she said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| So in effect, yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| But I didn't pass this wording by her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| I don't typically pass wording for resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| I would hope she would be willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| And I think she would be willing to hear from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| as long as she's mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| Yeah, and I think ultimately, the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| is if this board is willing to do that and make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4128)|
| 1:08:52| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4134)|
| 1:08:54| But you don't want to split them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| No, sir, because again, if I do, it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| affect the way I vote for 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| I think it was Ms. Owen and then Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4148)|
| 1:09:09| I may need the law director's help on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| If I understand correctly, if we approve 9B separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4154)|
| 1:09:20| from the substitute motion, the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| can't happen in this meeting, can it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Because it's not an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| So the only way that we could have the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| is if it's attached to 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4173)|
| 1:09:39| I would think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4179)|
| 1:09:41| So what would happen is, I mean, so you all at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| would need to vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4187)|
| 1:09:50| And if it passes, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| If it fails, then you would be going back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4192)|
| 1:09:59| to the original motion, which would simply just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| be to approve 9B, and that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| And then so there's not a way to split this into two agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| My understanding is that Mr. McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| would like to vote on these pieces separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| But since it's not part of an agenda item, it can't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| Well, I mean, somebody could ask for a new motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| I mean, that's separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| So if the substitute motion fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| then it goes to 9B, and then you approve or disapprove 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4228)|
| 1:10:35| Presumably, if it's approved, then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| could bring another motion to do what Mr. Watson's talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4242)|
| 1:10:43| But those would stand on their own at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| OK, that's extremely tricky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| All right, I also see Mr. McMillan's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| about ensuring that it will continue for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| Because the agreement, each of our MOA agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4258)|
| 1:11:02| have a clause that say any entity can withdraw from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| It can be canceled by either party on 30 days'| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| written notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| And so I understand the concern that one party has done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4271)|
| 1:11:19| once, and that it could happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| So I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| I feel like they have made an effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4284)|
| 1:11:32| to make an agreement with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4292)|
| 1:11:36| And so I would certainly hope that that kind of willy-nilly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4296)|
| 1:11:40| behavior wouldn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| But I think that a conversation with Mr. Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| would be all that would be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4304)|
| 1:11:47| I think a gentleman's agreement there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| would be adequate to make sure that that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4310)|
| 1:11:59| I would like to see these two together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| Because if we're approving 9B, we're approving 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| The community expects us to have some kind of review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| And our superintendent has said that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| would like to have one document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| It would be much easier to have one document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| So I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| I think separating this out as some kind of separate motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| is going to cause some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| I think having it attached here, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| here's what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| And this is contingent that we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| going to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4357)|
| 1:12:39| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| Ms. Vatterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| I, too, would like to see this combined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Because like everyone has mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| it gives superintendent direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| as what Christy Christy said, it is my expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| that superintendent would still get this community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| with the new chief of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| But this is a public-facing document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| to say our commitment to making it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| And I just want to give a perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| that, yes, we're individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| And we're elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| And we can serve our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| We're also a part of a system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| And so when we don't open or invite the community's voice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| in major, major decisions, it feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| like silencing a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| And so I think that approving this part of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| and adding this, will give that opportunity for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| to share their experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| If we take the input or not, that will come down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| But people have stories that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| want to share, good, bad, positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| And we can learn and grow from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| But I don't like us not, as a system, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4419)|
| 1:13:44| as a school system, shutting the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| on not having community input on how we keep our kids safe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| and how do we make sure that they feel safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| Because if we don't allow the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| to open up to include the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| then we're silencing voices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| And so I would like to see this pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I'm certainly not opposed to hearing from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| I certainly want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| I've made it clear that I think we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| individual district meetings, if it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| are town hall, as a board, or as a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| for our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| So I'm not, I am fine to support the memorandum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| I'm thankful that the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| and that the chief of police and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| were able to come to an agreement on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| for the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| It's obvious that we're going to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| to look at it with the way the conclusion is written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| But I'm uncomfortable with the community input part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| I really want to get the new chief of police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| or the new chief of security in and get his feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| and get his buy-in with what we're doing before we come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4494)|
| 1:14:59| with what, to me, this is too vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| as far as the community input, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| based on the other conversations that we've had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| So I'm fine with supporting the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| I'm not comfortable with the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| Madam Chair, I mean a lot of respect when I say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| I think if you roll back the tape of what you just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4523)|
| 1:15:29| you just said, I want to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| I recommended a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| And correct me if I'm wrong if this isn't what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| But at the same time, I'm not comfortable with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| because it suggests that we get community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| and we need to hear from our chief first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| And you also said this is too vague| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4547)|
| 1:15:50| when I've tried to be specific in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| You said it's too specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| So I'm asking you directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| So what's the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| So what I said the last meeting was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4559)|
| 1:16:02| that I feel like board members should have town halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| I feel like they should collect the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| from their district, sit down with the decision makers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| and identify what the issues are and see what changes may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| to come to an MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| So I think this is actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| it's actually telling the community we're open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| to doing what you're suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I mean all this is saying is we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| to get community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| Okay, but here's, I'm not in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| of doing a big, huge process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| There's nothing in this that describes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| There's no specifics about, and I did that very intentionally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| because you could do it the way you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| to do it just like you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Okay. I mean there's nothing in this that says we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| to do it X, Y and Z way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| All it says is in good faith we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| to engage the community in conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| And actually what it says is that the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| of schools is going to decide how to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| So I guess my concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| that we were still looking at a big process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4619)|
| 1:17:02| Well, but we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| We're putting the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| The superintendent has not made a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| of how he would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| He may come to the board and say, hey board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| I think it might be good for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| to host meetings in your communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| I mean there's been no conversation or expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| about how that process would happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Okay. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4643)|
| 1:17:30| It doesn't even say conversation in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| It just says that we'll leverage community input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| and that could be anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| That could be, it could be the public forum we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| There's nothing here that says we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| to do it one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4664)|
| 1:17:49| Something that confuses people in the community and also seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4669)|
| 1:17:56| to confuse some of us is that we are elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| in a representative election, but we are not elected just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| to take care of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Our duty is to the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4688)|
| 1:18:13| And if we are only serving our voting district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| we are not serving our school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4701)|
| 1:18:27| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you, Madam Chair and board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| Mr. Watson, I appreciate you taking the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| to present this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| I have a couple concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| One is that it came to us so late at the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4719)|
| 1:18:42| and why we weren't presented with this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| And then my concern is that, you know, no one's talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| to the sheriff it seems like on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| What is his input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| What is his thoughts on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| Has he seen this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| So why I agree with Ms. Christie that the expectations are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4738)|
| 1:19:02| that we're going to work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| that this will be a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| My concern is that the other groups in this haven't been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| talked to about this specific substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| Any feedback on that, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Yes, thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| So I kind of debated internally about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| I just had this idea, I think it was yesterday, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| when I talked to you about making a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4766)|
| 1:19:31| And we even had a discussion about does it make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| when does it make sense to send it out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| I, in the end, didn't decide to send it out early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| because there's really nothing controversial in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4779)|
| 1:19:42| And the last time that I presented something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4782)|
| 1:19:45| to this board, I sent it quite a bit early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| and was met with indifference about that in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| of how I did it and all that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| So it's interesting to me when we as an elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| get into conversations about how individuals bring things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| to the board about whether or not we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| to support something or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| We're actually fairly limited as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| We all know this about how we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| bring things before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| And we also know we're very limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| about having individual conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| Like, I can't sit down with you ahead of this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| and say, hey, Ms. Henderson, what do you think about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| I think it's still important to get this type of thing done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| Is that something you agree with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Is there a way that you would word this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Those aren't, we don't have those luxuries due to the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| And the superintendent, and superintendent again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| correct me wrong if I'm wrong, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| said several times over the last couple months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4841)|
| 1:20:43| that you have spoken to the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| And the sheriff has been open to a new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| He just says, hey, I don't want to hire somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| I don't want you all to hire somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| to tell me what to do, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Is that basically what he has said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| So this, again, does not go against what the sheriff has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| said or anybody else like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| But it's also a little bit odd that we keep bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| those other entities up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| We are the lead parent organization in this MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4868)|
| 1:21:12| And by being the lead parent organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| it's up to us to take the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| The sheriff will never come to us and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| and this is a negative statement about him as a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| he would never come to us and say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| I think we need to change the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| That's not the way that typically would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| is it would be us prompting it and saying, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| we want to try to get to a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| agreement than what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| And this also does not tie the sheriff's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| It doesn't tie the sheriff's hands or the chief's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| We can't tell them they have to get into a new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| And this doesn't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| All it does is empower the superintendent in good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| to go to those entities and say, we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| like to work toward one agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| And if superintendent, I mean, he's pretty persuasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| And if he can get them to the table to do that, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| But if he can't, he can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| He's not able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| He can't twist anybody's arm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| So I brought this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| I have tried to get this board to say one thing for three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| months, officially, that we want to hear from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| to put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| And for three months, I hear everybody on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4945)|
| 1:22:34| We want to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| But when it comes time to making the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| and putting it on paper, well, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| does this person feel about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| We didn't see this specific wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| I mean, there's nothing controversial in this wording.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| I didn't see this early enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| And again, Ms. Henderson, I'm expressing, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| some of what Bob did in terms of my own spirit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| Real frustration, because I got on this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| not because of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| I was not even aware of this when I got on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4983)|
| 1:23:07| But I got on this body to help this system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| be all that it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| And I think that's why all of us did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| But none of us can do anything by ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| We can't do anything by ourselves on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| And all I'm looking for is a little bit of, hey, yep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| we hear this is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5005)|
| 1:23:26| Multiple people on this board have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| expressed this as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| Nothing is controversial about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| I'm not expressing a specific way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| And I'm just saying, hey, can't we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| get to something better than what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| And let's tell the community we're going to try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| That's all I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| And there's going to be times when you do the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| with me, when you're going to say, hey, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| I know this may not be the issue that you care about the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| but I need your help getting it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| because I can't get it done on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| And that's what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| And I think it's not about me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| It's about sending the message to this community as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5042)|
| 1:24:06| that when we say we want to hear from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| we actually mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Because so many elected bodies, nobody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| who's an elected official is ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| going to stand up and say, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| want to hear from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| It would be ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| That would be absolutely stupid to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| But the community hears all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| from elected officials who say they want something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| that they don't really want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| And all I'm asking is, if you all really want that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| if you really think it's important to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| the community to this issue, then goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| vote for something that's not controversial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| and empower the superintendent to do his job when he says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| clearly to us he doesn't have direction on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| Ms. Hatterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| I'm glad you brought that, Daniel, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5091)|
| 1:24:54| what I'm asking for, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5094)|
| 1:24:55| We don't have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| So if it falls 4-4, it fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| We don't have healing in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| So I'm asking for just a bone, real quick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| like just throw a vote to start the healing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| We're going to school in August, and the kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| are going to be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| We have a great set up, have great principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| I have all faith that things will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| we will get back on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5116)|
| 1:25:17| But we're still grieving in District 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| And this is, your vote will start the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| of some type of healing process that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| need in our community to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5125)|
| 1:25:27| And so thank you, Daniel, for what you've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5127)|
| 1:25:31| I don't know what's all playing in everyone's mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| and decision making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| I don't know all the entities involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| But what I do know for my community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| and Knox County as a whole, this shook up the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| We need, we got to heal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| And it starts by hearing voices and hearing stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| So I just ask for somebody to just hear that on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5150)|
| 1:25:55| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| I just want to speak to one specific point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5158)|
| 1:26:02| that you made, Mr. Watson, about us being the lead organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| because I've heard that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| And my perspective is a little bit differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5168)|
| 1:26:12| because I see us more all as partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| While, yes, it is people coming into our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| but maybe, Mr. Oates or Mr. Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| you can speak to exactly how many officers are provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| to us by the different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| And it's my understanding that we are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| paying these officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| This is coming out of their budgets, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| So it's not like we're holding all the cards here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| I mean, we have to work together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| I see it more as a partnership than it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5202)|
| 1:26:45| is as us being able to say, we have to have this, this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I think that's an excellent point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5212)|
| 1:26:53| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5215)|
| 1:26:57| I've really looked at this wording as analytically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| as I possibly can while we've been talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| And I'm trying to find the objectionable pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| and I can't find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| It doesn't say the things that it sounds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| like from our conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5236)|
| 1:27:20| There's nothing here to discuss prior to this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| It says, with the expectation and authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5247)|
| 1:27:33| for the director of schools, not anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| but for the director of schools to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5256)|
| 1:27:39| with the other named entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| If the other named entities don't want to, that's on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5261)|
| 1:27:46| That's not on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| With the expectation and authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| for the director of schools to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| with the other named entities in the MOAs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| and combine them with the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| and the police department into one MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| If they choose not to, they choose not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| If they work together and it doesn't work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| We're not voting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| We're not voting on any of those pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| We're voting on authorizing the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5295)|
| 1:28:21| to work with those other entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| There's nothing to discuss with them prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5304)|
| 1:28:28| because we're authorizing the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5308)|
| 1:28:33| It doesn't make sense to have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5313)|
| 1:28:35| about having a discussion about having a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| All we're doing is authorizing the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| to work with the other named entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| and to listen to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| And Ms. Irwin, if that is if-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| There's nothing else here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5331)|
| 1:28:52| I want everyone to really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| that whatever's been reading, whatever's read into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| I can't understand where that's coming from because it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| here, it's not in these words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| If somebody can show that to me, if somebody can show me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| where it says in this that we're doing anything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5351)|
| 1:29:15| I'll be glad to look at it, but I can't find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| Call for the question, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5361)|
| 1:29:30| So do we have a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| Okay. Any discussion on calling for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| Okay. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5377)|
| 1:29:40| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5380)|
| 1:29:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5380)|
| 1:29:41| Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| Okay. So we'll go ahead and vote, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5383)|
| 1:29:52| This is a roll call vote on Mr. Watson's substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| Does anyone want me to read that back into the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| The motion is to approve item 9B with the expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| and authorization for the director of schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| to work with the other named entities in the MOAs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| to combine the separate MOAs with Knox County Sheriff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| Office and Knoxville Police Department into one MOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| leveraging input from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| and other stakeholder groups and present a proposed combined MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| for board approval within the next 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5429)|
| 1:30:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5430)|
| 1:30:30| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5430)|
| 1:30:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5440)|
| 1:30:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| That's four yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| So we have four yes and so it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| So that fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Do we have, can we go back to the original motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5458)|
| 1:31:02| We have a motion to approve 9B as it's presented on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5462)|
| 1:31:10| Okay. We have a motion by Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| We have a motion by Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| Discussion on 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| I think this point of discussion still has to do with 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5484)|
| 1:31:29| So Ms. Christie, I wanted to just address your comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| about being the lead organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| I don't think that's being taken the way I intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| By saying the lead organization, I don't mean that we have all the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| I mean, in any partnership, especially in MOA, so the organization that I run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| the Restoration House, I have an MOA with the Knoxville Leadership Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| What I mean by being the lead is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| if our organization didn't exist, there would be no MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| And that's what I mean by disagreement, is that if KCS did not exist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| there would be no MOA between KPD and KCSO, because there would be no need for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| And so all I mean by us being the lead is that we're the top stakeholder in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5525)|
| 1:32:14| Doesn't mean we control the cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Doesn't mean that it's for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| I will be passing on this, and I want to make it clear why I'm passing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5537)|
| 1:32:22| It's not because I don't agree with the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| I agree with the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| But I'm passing on it because, again, we as a board have consistently said two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5548)|
| 1:32:36| We want to review the MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| We want to get community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| I can't, in good faith, then go against that in a proven MOA that had no community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Ms. Natterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| Superintendent Tom, this is for you, and feel completely okay to pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| on the question that I'm going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| I just need clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Being that we did not vote to give you, to empower you to have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| to include community discussion, but also being that, as board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| there's an expectation that the director of school does this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| are you clear on what you need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| And, again, this is not a trick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| I'm not clear, and so I don't know if you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| Well, based on the vote, obviously, I don't have, I'm not authorized to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5600)|
| 1:33:28| do what is stated in the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| So, I really don't know what to do, I guess, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| I mean, I think that that's evident, right, and that's no, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5617)|
| 1:33:45| that's the messages that we've been giving Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| for the last three months here, and he's been tied up from actually doing his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5628)|
| 1:33:53| because his bosses are giving him two different messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| So, I understand where you're coming from, Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| on what not, how to move forward, and I don't know what I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5639)|
| 1:34:07| when the new chief of security comes in, I hope he's able to do whatever he needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| to do to get his plan in place, and whatever that looks like, I hope that none of us get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| in the way of the chief of security doing exactly what he needs to do to get his plan together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| because we've gotten in the way of Superintendent Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| from doing his job, from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| Thank you, Ms. Batterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| I think Ms. Christie was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| Yeah, and that's why I made my original comment when this was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| because, see, to me, this did bring an additional layer of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5674)|
| 1:34:40| I mean, in my mind, we pay and hire the superintendent to manage the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5680)|
| 1:34:46| and I don't feel like he needs my permission to do what we pay him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| But, see, when we put these forward and then vote on them, suddenly he does think he can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5693)|
| 1:35:01| or that there are restrictions there, and I guess that was my problem in the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| with the wording was that, you know, it already was my expectation that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| and the new security chief would have these discussions and move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5713)|
| 1:35:17| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5717)|
| 1:35:18| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5720)|
| 1:35:21| Mr. Dupler, by not outwardly authorizing, we have also not deauthorized, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5721)|
| 1:35:33| I mean, that's correct, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5733)|
| 1:35:39| I think as we discussed earlier that Mr. McMillan brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| there can always be a discussion amongst the parties, but the parties would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| to agree to make any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| So, if Mr. Thomas so chose, he could enter into discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5750)|
| 1:35:58| He could have, he could begin this process even though we have not authorized it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5758)|
| 1:36:07| He would still be able to do that if he so chose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| He could, and the way that would be most appropriate in his administrative role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5773)|
| 1:36:19| and as the sole employee of the board would be if there were some issues that came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| up operationally and you've talked about a new security chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| then that security chief feels like there's some things that need to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| then that would be probably the most obvious example of how that would come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| So, he could go ahead and have these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| He could go ahead and get input and then bring it to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5800)|
| 1:36:46| without us specifically authorizing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5806)|
| 1:36:51| Thank you, Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5814)|
| 1:36:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| All I was going to say is what Ms. Owen said and what Mr. Dupler confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5817)|
| 1:37:06| The, there's nothing to prohibit the superintendent from meeting with the city mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5826)|
| 1:37:16| and the, our new chief and working out something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| They could have the sheriff join them if they wish, but they do not have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| until they have something that they could present to the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5848)|
| 1:37:34| and reach some kind of common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| But I guess when you look at it, the, and this is not to belittle the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5857)|
| 1:37:48| but she's the wild card in the arrangements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5868)|
| 1:37:55| The superintendent, our new chief, and the mayor have to agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| on something before you would even think about going to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5881)|
| 1:38:07| and entering into an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| Yeah, I agree with what other board members have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| My expectation is that the superintendent would be in conversation with all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| of these entities on our behalf and this board doesn't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| to micromanage the way he does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| And so, that's my purpose for not supporting the original or the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| And so, I think that, you know, that's what we expect for the superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| to do is to manage this type of process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| So, I, there's, as Ms. Owen said, there's nothing that would prohibit him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| from doing his job, what he needs to do, and that would be my expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| So, if we have no other comments, we'll vote on this MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| And we can just do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| Ms. Owen, I'm sorry, not Ms. Owen, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| Yes. Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5956)|
| 1:39:17| Yes. Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| No. Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5960)|
| 1:39:21| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Five yes votes, one no vote, and two pass votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| Ms. Satterfield or Mr. Watson, do you want to change it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| I'm sorry, it's five yes votes, one no vote, and two pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| So, did either of the passes want to change their?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5977)|
| 1:39:47| Wait a minute, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| What were we voting on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| Voting on whether we're accepting, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| order please, the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| Well, why did, somebody said something about the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Well, I just referenced the substitute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| but I said that's why I didn't vote for the substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| So, we're just voting on the original 9B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6016)|
| 1:40:17| Okay, can I change my vote to yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| It's not by me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6022)|
| 1:40:23| It hadn't been announced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6023)|
| 1:40:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| Okay, I'll change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| To yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6029)|
| 1:40:29| So, that's six yes votes and two pass votes, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| Okay, thank you, Mr. McMillan, for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| Okay, and then we'll go to the next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6036)|
| 1:40:48| Approve scope of services for the Medical Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| for Knox County Schools Agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| to document the requirements and scope of services provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| by the Knox County Public Health Officer for KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| We have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6059)|
| 1:41:10| Okay, motion by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6070)|
| 1:41:18| Okay, motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Okay, and we have one public speaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| for public forum, Kim Kredich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| State your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6091)|
| 1:41:43| I'd like to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| that we reconsider the previous motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Okay, we have a motion to reconsider the previous motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| Discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| They want to go back to the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| with the health department because it failed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6126)|
| 1:42:06| There was not a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6126)|
| 1:42:09| Okay, do we have discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| There was not a second, so I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| we put it out in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| We can't come back at it like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Oh, you just said it's your vote, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6138)|
| 1:42:22| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| But it didn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| Excuse me, Mrs. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| But I'm talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| I would like clarification from the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| but it's my understanding Robert's rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| it cannot be brought back up in this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6153)|
| 1:42:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| Well, so she's asked for a motion to reconsider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| so I mean the motion to reconsider would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| to be voted on first before you could do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| But, okay, I'm still not clear, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| Okay. All right, so there was, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| it failed because there was no second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| So that's why the motion failed, because there has to be a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| for it to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| I think we all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| I think what just happened was similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| to what Mr. Mike just experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| where there was a little bit of confusion at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| about exactly what was happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6200)|
| 1:43:20| Did, I mean, I'm not wanting to speak from you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Did you all intend not to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| Okay, so that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6206)|
| 1:43:26| I think there was some confusion at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| Okay, so we'll vote on the motion that has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6209)|
| 1:43:32| to reconsider the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| Okay. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Aye. Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| No. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| Okay. I think we have, we want to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| Okay, let's do a roll call vote on that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| Ms. Satterfield, this is to reconsider the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| on item 6C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| Yes. Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| Yes. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| Yes. Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| No. Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| No. Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| No. Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6249)|
| 1:44:09| No. That's three yes votes and five no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| Okay, so motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Okay, now, Ms. Kredich, thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| I'm just waiting for the little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| Yeah, he's pulling the clock up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6264)|
| 1:44:36| Okay, she's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6276)|
| 1:44:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Hi, my name is Kim Kredich.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| I reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| I would like to talk to you about $114 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6281)|
| 1:44:46| I would like to talk about how you all plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| to spend the ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| To me, it's like with all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| I'll take any COVID silver lining I can take at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| and this seems like a huge windfall that can be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| for incredible progress in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| I did go to the public, the second public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| for public input about how the funding could be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| and might be used, and I thought it was an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| presentation, and I have many ideas to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6316)|
| 1:45:24| with the current situation and learning loss for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| with disabilities, as I think a lot of you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| that's been my passion for the last 16 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| that we've been in Knox County, and so I brought a visual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| and this represents 2009-2010 when one of our twin sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| who happens to have autism was in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| He went to Sequoia, then Vine Middle Magnet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| and then all our boys did, and West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| So this is what his fourth grade work looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| I've got binders and boxes of all of the modified work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6360)|
| 1:46:05| that he did all the way through, and I would like to propose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6365)|
| 1:46:10| that since what I heard from that presentation were things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| like interventions, developing resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| especially for populations that are typically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| that have disparities in outcomes, can be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6380)|
| 1:46:24| and I've researched it, there are a lot of possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| So I'm discouraged still that this board promised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6388)|
| 1:46:32| I think about five or six years ago, Lynn Fugate promised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| that you all would have workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| on what special ed law and the requirements entailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6397)|
| 1:46:41| and since it is your board policy to follow the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| the federal and state law, I'm still discouraged that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| on the board still don't seem to know what it entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| I think the recording issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| for IEP meetings brought forth the lack of knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| People said they don't know what goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| on in IEP meetings except for a few who had attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6420)|
| 1:47:05| And one of the big points that I would like you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| to understand, and I looked up the LEA plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and it says right here, for 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| utilize the AAD standards and district developed resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| to support classroom instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| within general education environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| We have failed all of our targets for inclusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| in the least restrictive environment every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6447)|
| 1:47:30| since I can see data on the TDOE website since 2012,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| and we keep failing improvement on our failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6454)|
| 1:47:38| And so I was very heartened to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| that my friend Jason Myers is the person responsible for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| and that gives me a clue that you all are hopefully in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| for the students with significant disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| because those are the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| on the alternate academic diploma| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6471)|
| 1:47:53| or alternate assessment standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| When I don't know if you all know the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| between a modification and accommodation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| but what we're doing right now in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6482)|
| 1:48:05| as far as I can tell for the last 16 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6485)|
| 1:48:08| is that we're doing it student by student by student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| We don't have a modifications bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6492)|
| 1:48:14| These, this is fourth grade sitting in my basement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| and I've got third through twelfth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6498)|
| 1:48:21| And when a student is on modified content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6501)|
| 1:48:24| where they're on the alternate assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| or they just need modified work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| and the IEP team decides whether they will earn a credit bearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6510)|
| 1:48:34| course based on how much it is modified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| My own son got a special education diploma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| He went to four years of the UT Future Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| He lives independently with a little bit of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| and if you drive by Sunspot and notice the Sunspot Restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| and notice the umbrellas up, those yellow umbrellas, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| he's been putting them up for about five weeks now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| So he's got gainful employment in his absolute future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| So it was a success, but it takes this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| If he did not have appropriately modified content,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| his behaviors would have been such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| that he would never have been able to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| And that has been the biggest issue I have seen from parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| especially during COVID when the parents were let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| into the classroom virtually, and they're like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| my kid can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| No wonder they don't like school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| So I'm, I know that's a lot of information out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| but I don't have time to give you a whole workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| because I've got seven seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| But look at this and think about it, and please talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6576)|
| 1:49:40| and ask what's possible with that ESSER funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6580)|
| 1:49:43| This is just one idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6584)|
| 1:49:46| Thank you, and thank you to, thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| to all our public speakers for coming to share your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| with us this evening, and we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210714?start=6593)|
