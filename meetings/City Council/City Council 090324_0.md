| 0:02:02| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of March 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=122)|

| 0:02:22| Just as a moment of explanation, I have been requested to ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| I think it's been determined that a little bit more study needs to be had before we act upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=147)|

| 0:02:58| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| It looks like MPC is requesting items 10-A and 10-B to be postponed for how many weeks, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=179)|
| 0:03:08| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=188)|
| 0:03:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=192)|
| 0:03:14| 12-E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| It goes with 12-E and F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=195)|

| 0:03:25| Mr. Donaldson, can you explain why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=205)|
| 0:03:32| The ad in the public notice made reference to a zone district shorthand that was incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=212)|
| 0:03:40| And the second time that that's happened and we've traced it back to the original application for the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| which used the wrong nomenclature, and our technicians simply put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=227)|
| 0:03:53| We think we've got it right this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=235)|

| 0:09:40| All those in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| Excuse me, a relation between these two guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| Twins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=585)|

| 0:09:52| Zoning Regulations, Article V, Section 10,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Signs, Billboards, and Other Advertising Structures and Related Sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| regarding the operating regulations of electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Okay, council, we have, let's see, a couple people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| I actually think it's maybe three people signed up to speak in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=608)|
| 0:10:12| three against, and three who are somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| I think given the nature, I'm going to go ahead and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| even though that doesn't quite fit our rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| allow all of them to speak unless someone would like to contest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=621)|
| 0:10:27| And maybe ask all the speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| just remind them that this is maybe the seventh time we've talked about this at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=629)|
| 0:10:34| So let's try not to retread old ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| I think folks have heard a lot of the arguments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=636)|
| 0:10:38| and I think people understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| We're not discouraging you to come and make your points at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| Just remember that this is, like I said, maybe our sixth or seventh time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| so you might get right to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| I was going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| is it helpful to remind people that there's now a 9A and a 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| that we have separated the issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Why don't you go ahead and describe that now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| That would be very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| We have done, for clarity's sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| the first thing we're considering is an ordinance that will ban with exceptions new electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| And then the second ordinance, 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| is actually dealing with electronic message centers in a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| So if that helps people speak, clarify which issue we're talking about, that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=675)|
| 0:11:22| I think that's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| And when you get up to speak, most of the folks signed up to speak to either 9A or 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| everybody signed up to speak to 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| You might just clarify that your remarks are to one or the other or both if you need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| Okay. Ready to go then, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I will allow people who are signed up to speak decidedly four first, and Duane Greve will be first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=702)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Duane Greve, 8 Emory Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| First of all, I want to say that I passed out to all of you a diagram of some billboards on your way into Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=719)|
| 0:12:08| and I just want you to take a look at that very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| I also want to say that I certainly appreciate, Mayor, this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| I'm not sure this is the sixth, seventh, or tenth, or twelfth time that I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| But I do want to say that one thing that I've been most impressed about is the accessibility of all the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=738)|
| 0:12:25| in returning emails, phone calls, and I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| I think that shows that our city has a government that's really open and open to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| So, again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Tonight I'm pleased to speak on behalf of Scenic Knoxville, as I have on many occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| We recognize that all of us are ready to come to a decision about the EMC issue, electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| and, as Councilman Frost says, every meeting considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| But I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| Signage in general says a lot about the quality of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| We are at a pivotal crossroads here where City Council has an opportunity to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=779)|
| 0:13:05| that will benefit the city for a long time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| We are fortunate to be blessed in this area by our many mountains, hillsides, lakes, the beautiful river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=789)|
| 0:13:16| and considerably more green space than many communities around the nation have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=796)|
| 0:13:22| Recently, Ed McMahon, a nationally known authority on sustainable development, visited our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| In his remarks, he stated that communities must have a vision for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| and those communities who set no standards will compete at the bottom from those communities who have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=814)|
| 0:13:42| He ended his presentation with the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Will development and business interests shape the character of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=825)|
| 0:13:50| or will the character of East Tennessee shape that development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| We at Scenic Knoxville support the ban and regulations included in Ordinance 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| If enacted, this ordinance will erase and regulate much of the visual clutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| before it gets a foothold on our scenic city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| This ordinance will help encourage businesses to erect more quality signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| with consistent regulations that level the playing field for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| Business will not have to compete with their neighbors in terms of bright, distracting signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=860)|
| 0:14:26| And tighter regulations on existing EMCs should be much easier to monitor and regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| But most important of all, Knoxville will make a clear statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| about how the city wants to present itself and preserve its aesthetic qualities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| We hope that your vote will reflect a belief that Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| just recently named Tree City USA for the 18th year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=887)|
| 0:14:52| will not become Anywhere USA, but instead a community that continues to seek green city initiatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=892)|
| 0:15:00| and is working to unclutter some major eyesore areas and redevelop others with new design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=900)|
| 0:15:08| Thank you in advance for a vote that will enhance the visual integrity of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| and help preserve our scenic resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| Our scenic environment is too precious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| It's too precious to be destroyed by unsafe, distracting, and unsightly signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=924)|
| 0:15:25| And, Mayor, I would like, when 9B comes, to be able to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=928)|
| 0:15:29| Thank you so noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| Bob Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=933)|
| 0:15:41| Bob Wolfenbarger, Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association and lifelong resident of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| Meeting my address, 3200 Lexan Lane, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Sorry, I haven't been here in a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| First of all, I'd like everybody that is here supporting 9A to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=955)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| And I thank City Council for being forebears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=966)|
| 0:16:14| This body has taken the challenge, and I think have done it in a manner that is respectful of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=974)|
| 0:16:24| But most importantly, as Councilwoman Pelos spoke in her prayer before the meeting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| this is God's gift, all this beauty that we have, and that we should be very careful in how we manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=992)|
| 0:16:39| So I'm going to be very brief and just say that I support 9A, and I would encourage you all to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Terry Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1017)|
| 0:17:04| I'm speaking tonight for the members of the Bearden Council and also especially for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| The composition of this council will change significantly in nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| and this could be the last time I'll speak before this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| I'm counting the months down because I'm very sad about losing some of the excellent representatives that we've had on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| And I've said many times in the past this is the best city council that I've seen in my 43 years as a city resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| and I say that with great sincerity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| As a council, you're leaving an important body of legislative work for Knoxville and for the city itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1061)|
| 0:17:50| and we cannot thank you enough for what you've accomplished together to improve the quality of our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| If you pass this amendment tonight to ban additional EMCs and to regulate those already existing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1077)|
| 0:18:05| it will be one of the most significant legacies that you will leave for us and for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| Help us to preserve and enhance our natural beauty and vote yes on the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| I'm now going to go to those who are somewhere in between and Tommy Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Mr. Mayor, I might preface this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| We are all speaking on 9-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Do you want us to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I think it would be better if you're just speaking on 9-B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| I think if that group would wait, that would probably be best, unless some way the council has different feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Now I'm going to speak to those who signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| And Ben Doden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1124)|
| 0:18:50| Benjamin Doden, 106 Dawn Court, White House, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| I work for Watch Fire Signs by Time-O-Matic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| We're an industry leader in electronic manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Over the last couple council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| I have provided studies to prove that there's no evidence supporting any type of myth that electronic message centers are a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1145)|
| 0:19:13| In fact, some cases show a reduction in accidents by effectively communicating a message clearly with appropriate sized copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1153)|
| 0:19:23| I have also gone over the benefits of electronic message centers for small businesses to try to compete in a growing corporate market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1163)|
| 0:19:30| When a city has a thriving small business community, it also has an increase in tax revenue and a decreased unemployment rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1170)|
| 0:19:39| Churches, schools, and other nonprofit organizations utilize electronic message centers to notify the public about events and display public service messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1179)|
| 0:19:48| The Small Business Association and U.S. Chamber of Commerce both endorse electronic message centers because they stimulate commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1188)|
| 0:19:56| Tonight I have passed out two handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| The first handout has three pages of pictures of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| The first page illustrates signage that is still allowed with the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| The following two pages illustrate typical installations of electronic message centers that will be banned with the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| Aesthetics are always a concern when dealing with a new sign code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| If you owned a business, which some of you probably do, which signs would you rather have promoting your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| One that resembles a sign on the first page that has too much copy and lettering too small for the motoring traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1224)|
| 0:20:32| or a sign that resembles one on the second or third page that have crisp, clean content that is easy to read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1232)|
| 0:20:40| and aesthetically pleasing to the public, inviting them to come in and do business with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1240)|
| 0:20:45| The second handout is the electronic portion of a model sign code nearing completion that has guidelines for regulating electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1245)|
| 0:20:55| The finished code will be available by April 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Along with this model code, I have attached a brief biography of Professor Alan Weinstein and David Hart, authors of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1259)|
| 0:21:07| Professor Weinstein is a past chair of the Planning and Law Division of the American Planning Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| David Hart is also a member of the American Planning Association and is president of DB Hart Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| which provides innovative planning and development services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| They have worked with the Signage Foundation and other professors at Cleveland State University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| to create a model sign code for municipalities to use as a guideline when making changes to existing and outdated codes across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1289)|
| 0:21:37| I would like to encourage all the members of Council to vote against the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| and allow myself to work with the MPC and use this model sign code as a guideline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1301)|
| 0:21:46| to quickly compose an effective sign code that allows regulated AMCs to exist in commercial districts in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1306)|
| 0:21:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Let's see, next will be Rick Burnett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1318)|
| 0:22:06| Rick Burnett, 9010 Candlewood, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| I work in the sign business here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Thank you all for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| I'm against the approval of 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| Mr. Mayor, I feel with you being the leader of this city you need to be a little bit more vocal in supporting Knoxville's business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| Knoxville needs to be progressive rather than regressive, which 9A is very regressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| By you quietly standing by and allowing Knoxville and Council members to basically punch Knoxville's business community in the gut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| by ramming this AMC band down everyone's throat, it's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| You've heard several business owners state that these AMCs do produce positive results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1375)|
| 0:23:02| Do you ban polio vaccines, smallpox vaccinations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1382)|
| 0:23:05| or decide not to have open heart surgery because of the small chance of adverse reactions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1385)|
| 0:23:11| No, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| You'd be well to be blunt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| You'd be ignorant to not take advantage of the technological advances available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| And these business owners consider this AMC as a technological advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| The same is true for AMCs compared to static reader boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| The only difference between AMCs and a static reader board is the level of technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| If you're going to ban AMCs, you might as well ban the reader boards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| AMCs are easier to read, more aesthetically pleasing to the eye,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and much, much more productively beneficial to the business owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| as has been testified to by owners of Strike and Spare, Wishbones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| and even by the City of Knoxville's actions in their use at the Convention Center, Civic Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1437)|
| 0:24:03| and all over this city-county building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| For those who are afraid of the, you know, prospect of AMCs popping up all over town, plain and simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| that just won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| Unlike Pigeon Forge, which Mr. Frost and Hulst was continually referred to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| Knoxville businesses have to have 200 feet of road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Pigeon Forge requires none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| In addition to that, most business owners can't afford these AMCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| even if they do have 200 feet of frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| For those that can afford it, this technology should be at their disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| and they should have the right to use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| Finally, I add that, you know, the dogwoods, mountains, and rivers that Mr. Greave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| and Scenic Knoxville refer to will not be hidden by any signs on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| Clinton Highway, or Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| They'll still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| They'll still be visible for all the visitors of Knoxville, for the residents of Knoxville to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1499)|
| 0:25:05| for our kids to see and enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| But in the business community along Kingston Pike, Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| signs proliferate, and they're going to continue to proliferate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| But we need to be progressive and vote against this 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| We don't need to be a regressive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| We need to go into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| And the technology of LEDs and EMCs is the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| I'm against 9A, and it is Council's duty and responsibility to vote no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1535)|
| 0:25:41| and support your local business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| And Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1546)|
| 0:25:58| Are you aware I'm talking for the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| It was checked to sign against, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| If you'll come down and speak to it, we'll just note that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| I'm sorry that the checkmark here is against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| My name is Virginia Douglas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| I live at 918 Gratz Street in the Fort McGill neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| and I'm one of the developers of the Victorian houses on West Baxter Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| I feel that this ordinance will not make it easier for people to find businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| and I do not believe it will really help the business community that much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1592)|
| 0:26:38| and I would like for you not to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| That is all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Is there anybody else that wanted to speak to 9A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| That is all that I have signed up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| I want to make certain I didn't miss somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| We'll move to discussion of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Remember, we're talking about 9A now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1617)|
| 0:27:01| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| I'm actually going to start with a housekeeping piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1622)|
| 0:27:06| There's a little note on our thing about the motion that Mr. Frost made on price changer signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1626)|
| 0:27:16| that actually shows up on page 20 of 28 in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and I guess my question for Mr. Swanson and Ms. Poplin is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| do we need a motion to put the language that's highlighted there, or is that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| I think we need to clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| It will need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| That's why I put the detailed note, because the motion last time was so specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| it didn't capture this third instance where that same language was repeated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| So we need a motion to amend to add the language that's highlighted here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1661)|
| 0:27:49| No, actually the one that's not highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Changeable price signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| It actually is the one that's highlighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1672)|
| 0:27:53| So it's three per structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Per structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| Signed structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1676)|
| 0:27:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1677)|
| 0:27:58| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Anybody want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| Anybody like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Are you ready to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| Could I just say that if you make this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| that will not necessarily send this back to first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| because that is a clarification rather than a substantive change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| in case you're interested in that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| Everybody ready to vote on the amendment then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Seeing no lights, we're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Councilman Frost made a strong point the last time we considered these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| that a number of members of the business community and the public both have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| followed this for a long, long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| and I would support voting on this tonight and putting it to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| Well, I'm not going to restate all the reasons I gave for opposing this the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1738)|
| 0:29:05| last time we discussed it, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| I just think that this thing is detrimental to small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| and I think that we ought to be doing everything that's possible to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| through these hard economic times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| and I just don't think this is the right time to be doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Just briefly, I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| I don't like the idea of saying let's put it to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| I have the task force resolution that's been tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| I think there's more discussion we have to have on this to work out some of the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| We're passing a ban with exemptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| and I think we need to be clear about what the exceptions to the ban are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| but I'm definitely voting for this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| I think this is the right way to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| I think there is eventually a next step we need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| Ms. Pito.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| Well, like Councilman Hall, I'm not going to repeat all of my previous comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| and I think I've made it clear to Mr. Greave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| and to many people that I've spoken with about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| And I look out there, and they're all my friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| and they are all supporting this ordinance, and I just cannot do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| I was in full support of the material that was brought to us by the task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| I thought the task force did a yeoman's task in finding a way to regulate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| which I believe strongly in regulation, which can be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| And I felt that they had really broached all of those subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| And I thought pretty fairly brought us something that I could support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| My problem is supporting a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| I just simply feel that I have an obligation as much to the business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1847)|
| 0:30:54| to the overall development of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| because they are taxpayers, as are we who are residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| And I felt that that task force's work was very balanced and very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| And I feel to vote for a ban is just a problem for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| because I do not feel it's a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| I do think this is a time where people who are in business are really having a serious time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| keeping their businesses competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And there are some comments that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| I thought particularly, I think this is a very good example of where I believe that technology can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1891)|
| 0:31:40| much better information for the traveling public, for the shopping public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| than many of these signs, which are reader boards, which are in smaller print| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| and do not have the same regulation that we could have enforced had we looked at the task force's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| And so, consequently, I feel it's a time when maybe we are not taking the very best avenue for the future of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1922)|
| 0:32:11| There will always be signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| There will always be the need for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| And I think we need to find the best way in which to incorporate that into our city's life and lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1936)|
| 0:32:24| And I simply do not believe a ban is going to allow us that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1944)|
| 0:32:29| Maybe taking a second to look at this, but, you know, my experience has been we have spent a great deal of time at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1949)|
| 0:32:35| The task force spent a great deal of time at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Prior to that, this council had a task force on which Ms. Roddy and I met and worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| and had many professionals involved in that and heard from them their needs and their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| So, I just hope you understand that I am for regulation, regulation that can be enforced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| and I believe that we had that opportunity and that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| But I simply cannot support a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| Councilman Wahl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1993)|
| 0:33:14| I just wanted to say briefly that I think it's a strong ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| I think it's forward looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| I think that we are actually setting the stage for a stronger, more beautiful, more asset-based city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2000)|
| 0:33:29| And inasmuch as that's the case, I think it is very pro-business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2014)|
| 0:33:35| Councilman Hawkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I think everyone knows I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| I've supported it all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| I'd like to also make the comment that technology is constantly changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| I've had several comments from some people in the audience about technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| and taking advantage of new technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| Technology changes at a more and more rapid pace, in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| And one of the things that I think we'll see in the future is the cost of these particular technologies come down substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| I don't think there's much question that it will come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| The question is how quickly and to what degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2048)|
| 0:34:10| But I think it will come down substantially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| which if you have 200 feet of street frontage is all that is required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| that could put a fairly intensive number or concentration of these kinds of signs in place if they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2058)|
| 0:34:27| The comment about Pigeon Forge, I think there are some, perhaps, that are closer than 200 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2067)|
| 0:34:35| Most of them are not, based on my experience of driving through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| So I think we're asking for, if we don't regulate the existing and ban new ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2078)|
| 0:34:45| we're asking for a lot of problems and a lot of visual impact that we don't have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2085)|
| 0:34:53| And I'd also point out that as the future approaches, as we work our way into the future, I should say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2093)|
| 0:35:02| there will undoubtedly be technologies that will make on-site signage perhaps even less important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2102)|
| 0:35:10| As the technologies of cell phones and PDAs and GPS units, et cetera, begin to merge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2110)|
| 0:35:17| which they already are to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2117)|
| 0:35:20| people will be able to selectively find products and services and businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| without having to observe on-site signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| That's something that's in process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| It exists to a small degree now, and it will become much, much more prevalent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| and probably ubiquitous within the next five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| And so I think we have to anticipate what's coming as well as what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| So I think this is a very wise move to try to bring this thing under control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| this particular technological advance, if you want to call it that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| because it's just one step of many to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2156)|
| 0:36:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Ms. Mitchell, why don't you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Councilman Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Councilman Whithull?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| Councilman Booker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| Councilman Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| Councilman Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| Councilman Hultquist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Councilman Palo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| I heard six ayes and three noes, so the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| Article V, Section 10, signs, billboards, and other advertising structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| and related sections regarding electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| on a development directory sign approved as part of a master sign plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| There's a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| Excuse me, I think Mr. Seymour, you all go ahead and speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Mr. Stokes, you want to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| My name is Tommy Stokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| I live at 9424 Polo Club Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| I'm a designer and a brand consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| I designed the logo for the city of Knoxville, the convention center, Dogwood Arts Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2239)|
| 0:37:26| a lot of other stuff around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| When dealing with signage issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| compromise between business interests and beautification interests should be reached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| in order to achieve a mutually satisfying result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| I submit 9B represents a solid example of the type of compromises that can be achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2262)|
| 0:37:51| The Turkey Creek effort is an example of a program that offers incentives for new development or redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| where signage master planning might be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| where leverage can be applied to the developers to remove billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| This is what Turkey Creek did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| They removed six billboards and prevented hundreds of on-premise signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| Mr. Greave mentioned a standard previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I made a note here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| This is a standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| This sign is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Turkey Creek is arguably the single most important retail asset in Knoxville and the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| The interstate through Knoxville is a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| It is one of the most traveled stretches of road in the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| Traffic from three major interstates pass through Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| These interstates are the lifeblood of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| and we should be working with business to get people off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2328)|
| 0:38:53| The interstate is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| It is a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| It's not the mountains or the lakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| It's an urban experience where people are conditioned to see commercial enterprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| just like they expect to see rolling mountains and hills when they arrive at our national parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2347)|
| 0:39:14| From a business perspective, decisions that impact signage have an immediate and measurable effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| A measurable effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| There's a loss of income from advertising in this situation by the Turkey Creek tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| There's the loss of income from the untapped resources that don't get off of the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| There's the immediate loss of an opportunity for over 200 businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| to communicate to the thousands of cars that pass them each day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| And the potential loss of millions in taxable revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| which means money for the state, the county, and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| Council will not have to worry about a product like this one often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| Turkey Creek has become a city within a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| and is an economic engine for our community, generating millions annually in tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| There are 211 businesses in Turkey Creek, and there is one sign on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2405)|
| 0:40:13| Everything in Knoxville is measured against Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| If you're developing a business in Loudoun, you're ten minutes from Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| It has become an icon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I rode through Atlanta last weekend, which most definitely is an urban environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| There are similar signs for the Cobb Energy Center, Turner Networks, JCPenney outlets, Tanger outlets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| I say similar, but they're all about twice the size of this one that were proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| The Turkey Creek managers generated a master signage plan on their own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| They are the first to introduce responsible sign management practices in Knoxville on a large scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2448)|
| 0:40:55| If they had allowed, which was their right, signage up and down the interstate and Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| there would be hundreds of signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| They fought your fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| They negotiated consistently every time a tenant came to Turkey Creek and wanted a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| A single sign with multiple messages as part of a master signage plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| will allow a large retail development of a certain size to reduce the amount of clutter next to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2479)|
| 0:41:28| It addresses business interests and beautification interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| It is a compromise that is a positive step for business and a positive step for Knox beautification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2492)|
| 0:41:39| This example should be adopted as one of the tools used going forward by our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| Thanks for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Yes, very briefly, and we have heeded your admonition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| I don't know how many times we have been up here, but I want to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| The ordinance at present allows 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| This is 149 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| I don't know exactly what the speed limit is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| but the realistic speed limit on I-40 going past Turkey Creek is 70 to 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| If you aren't going that, you're going to get run over or honked at and have a truck in your trunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| We are asking for 350 square feet, which still gets us within the columns here and allows visibility to the traveling public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2549)|
| 0:42:45| We are asking that the 150 square feet be amended to 350 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| Otherwise, we are fine with 9b.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Let me just follow up on what Mr. Stokes said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2575)|
| 0:43:00| Turkey Creek has become a destination, largely within the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2580)|
| 0:43:08| Read the real estate ads on Sunday's paper for Anderson County, Loudoun County, Rome County, Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2588)|
| 0:43:19| How do they describe the location of their subdivision or the home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2599)|
| 0:43:25| X minutes from Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| I was coming back from Loudoun County the other day from court, and I was listening to the WNOX talk radio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2608)|
| 0:43:37| The ads for a lake development in Rome County on Watts Bar Lake, how did they identify its location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2617)|
| 0:43:46| 15 minutes from Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| This is a new city out there almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2629)|
| 0:43:54| It's retail, it's hospital, it's restaurants, it's residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| We, I submit, have set a standard for development in this community, not only in the way Turkey Creek is done, but in the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2642)|
| 0:44:13| We need to tap every dollar we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2653)|
| 0:44:16| You all are coming up on your budget hearings here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2656)|
| 0:44:19| We need to get more money into the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| A sign such as Turkey Creek is requesting will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2664)|
| 0:44:32| Now, as the ordinance reads, the 9a that was just passed, we have exempted the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2672)|
| 0:44:41| I'm not going to quarrel with that too much, although I get a little burned out when our masters find that they are different from those who are being ruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2681)|
| 0:44:53| But I think it's a good idea to have the two EMCs at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2693)|
| 0:45:03| I'm always interested, hoping we're getting a lot more business in there because you run showing who the upcoming conventions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| And I think that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| The Civic Coliseum has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| That is very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| There's one right out here on the wall out here that tells you what's going on in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| That's very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| The Tennessee Theater is a downtown worker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| I enjoy the Tennessee Theater's EMC, which some have said is historic, but it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2724)|
| 0:45:30| That technology was not available at the time the Tennessee Theater was running as a first run movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2730)|
| 0:45:38| I am a little worried because it can only change every minute now under 9a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| It cannot change, as I understand, every ten seconds, which I think it does now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| I enjoy the sports and tourism sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| I wish they would slow it down a little so I could get the messages on it a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| But these are all part of what make a city a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2759)|
| 0:46:05| Turkey Creek is a very well-done development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| It's not nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Man needs retail, restaurants, hospitals, and all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| And we need to show people how to get there and show these people who are buying the homes in Lake Developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2776)|
| 0:46:25| in Loudoun and Rome County how to get to Turkey Creek to spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| We're asking for a 350-square-foot sign, an EMC, and we submit that as a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2790)|
| 0:46:39| This is over a 300-acre development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| It has more than a mile of frontage on Interstate 40-75,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| which ranks within the top two heaviest travel portions of the interstate system in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| We need to get as many people off as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| Within another few weeks, if I was here, I would not be talking about 211 stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| I would be talking about more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| There is more to come at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| We need to utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| And this sign is consistent with what this council is trying to do on signage in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| Mr. Bedwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Robert Bedwell, 1321 Harvey Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Just four points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| Turkey Creek has more green space than any other private development in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| It is Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| The green space, the retail, the offices, the hospital, the theaters are a positive attraction for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2864)|
| 0:47:53| If you have visitors, it's one of the first things you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| You go there at 7 a.m. on Saturday morning, there must be 500 people out there running every Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2877)|
| 0:48:06| We want to continue to increase sales tax, which everybody in this room benefits from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2886)|
| 0:48:16| And fourth, we believe that 150 feet will not be enough incentive for other areas of the town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2896)|
| 0:48:28| to look at taking billboards down in exchange for an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| Let's see, Mr. Grieve, I think you wanted to speak back to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| Dwayne Grieve, number eight, Emory Place in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| First of all, thanks for passing 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| Second, I'm a little bit confused about this ordinance 9B from the standpoint that we have the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2936)|
| 0:49:05| and the city of Farragut, and we don't seem to be talking about Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| We don't seem to have Farragut even here or coming before us to say anything about the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| that they don't allow these kind of signs even in their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| One of the things that Scenic Knoxville has done, and we've had great communications with Arthur and his group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2958)|
| 0:49:25| is that originally Scenic Knoxville started out saying no EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| Now, that's not to say that we don't appreciate what Turkey Creek has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| It's a fantastic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| They've done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| They've got great signage within their development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| They've got the green space that they've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| And from that standpoint, we're pleased and we're proud of what Turkey Creek has done also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| We just don't understand why Turkey Creek can't say what they're doing inside to say it on the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2987)|
| 0:49:53| that they're Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| Also, I find it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| I've talked to a number of people over the last couple of weeks, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| it's surprising to me how many people know where Turkey Creek is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| And they tell me that they know where Turkey Creek is because when they drive down the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| they see Bed, Bath, and Beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| They see CarMax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3008)|
| 0:50:09| They see Belks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| They see the movie theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| They don't even see the sign that's there that says Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| And so I'm a bit confused on why we need this big sign, especially with an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| Now, what Scenic Knoxville has done is that when we started out, we did say, okay, we agree with 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3023)|
| 0:50:30| That's the same size as Knox Wholesale Furniture, which is right down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| And when you drive by the interstate, you can see that sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| And it's not even perpendicular to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| It's horizontal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| And yet, at the same time, you can see a sign that size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| We've also agreed at the last council meeting that, okay, we'll go to 150 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| which you can see the diagram that they have here on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| And so we would really like to say that on behalf of Scenic Knoxville, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| we appreciate what Turkey Creek has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3059)|
| 0:51:01| We appreciate the business that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| But we would like to see the ordinance passed as is at 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| That's all that I have signed up to speak unless I missed somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| I have a question for Mr. Seymour and Mr. Bidwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| You're limited to a 400 square foot total sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| Can you talk a little bit in your 350 square feet about what you're not going to have on the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3088)|
| 0:51:33| to get it within 400 total square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3093)|
| 0:51:42| We're probably going to have to go back and discuss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| and I understand this may be coming up, a discussion of the master signage plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3105)|
| 0:51:53| We are contractually obligated to keep three people on there, Walmart, Target, and CarMax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| And the rest of it we want to devote to an EMC that we can sell to the remaining tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| in the remaining 211 tenants in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| Now, you also, if you read the code, you actually have to have something on it that says Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3132)|
| 0:52:17| So, I mean, I'm concerned about what you don't have on that sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3137)|
| 0:52:23| because if you're contractually obligated to have the three at the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3143)|
| 0:52:26| and our law actually says you have to have Turkey Creek, I see your sign being way too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| We could put Turkey Creek in the EMC if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3159)|
| 0:52:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| I appreciate the number of meetings we've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| and I know we've heard each other talk about this for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| I supported 9A because I felt like it was the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| and I try to pride myself as being someone that's pro-business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| and I thought Councilman Woodhull said it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| It is pro-business, and it's future thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| And I think it's the appropriate thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| Having said that, I also think that what Turkey Creek has done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3186)|
| 0:53:13| taking on a master sign plan and taking it upon themselves to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| implementing it on their own well before scenic Knoxville, is a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3198)|
| 0:53:27| and it ought to be rewarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| I think Turkey Creek is a good starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| It sets the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| It's a good example of signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| And I don't agree with these EMCs everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| I think there's places where it's appropriate and places it's inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| And when we look at these signs in Sevierville and towards Pigeon Forge, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3222)|
| 0:53:49| you look and there's the mountains in the background and there's a lot of scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| And when you look at Turkey Creek and you look at the Turkey Creek sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| the backdrop for this EMC are the Turkey Creek buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| I mean, there is no scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| It's not taking, you know, the scenery away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| I think what Turkey Creek done is exactly what the motto of scenic Knoxville is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3249)|
| 0:54:15| and that is to preserve and enhance the scenery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| This does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| They took down some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| They prevented 150 signs from going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| They took down something like six pole signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3264)|
| 0:54:27| And imagine what Turkey Creek would look like had they not done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| There are billboards that are inside of Turkey Creek inward that is the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3272)|
| 0:54:39| Turkey Creek having been annexed, there's billboards, electronic billboards on Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3279)|
| 0:54:47| And, you know, I think that when you talk about economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| we're talking about people driving by seeing this signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| The way to finance our city is through other people's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| and people are coming from surrounding areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3300)|
| 0:55:02| They're driving down the interstate and they're looking and they're seeing what's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| And this gives those small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| and those new customers the opportunity within Turkey Creek to get people off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3309)|
| 0:55:17| And I've said all along I think that originally when this concept of 100 acres came up that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3317)|
| 0:55:26| several council members said there really wouldn't be any other development like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| But I think what we ought to do is we ought to come up with a concept of a graduated sign plan based on acreage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3331)|
| 0:55:38| because I do think that some of these communities in Fountain City and Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3338)|
| 0:55:43| and maybe the Bearden community might take advantage of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| that if they knew that they could take down their existing signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| And I think we need to take a look at all of our signage in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| but that if you can take down a number of these ugly signs and some of these billboards for one EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3355)|
| 0:56:01| I think that's something that we ought to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| But I think that the Turkey Creek is a great example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| and I'm glad that some council members are starting to look at and discuss the size and what goes on the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3368)|
| 0:56:17| because that's what we ought to be talking about because this is a big tax base for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| They've done the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| It's a good example, and we ought to reward them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| So I'm going to hopefully we can move towards something that's acceptable to the Turkey Creek people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| I appreciate Mr. Stokes' comments because I think this is a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3392)|
| 0:56:38| and Turkey Creek should be rewarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Councilwoman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| Well, having been involved with this for seven years now, and you all are well aware of that, I mean, I just cannot say enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3403)|
| 0:56:53| I thought Councilman Bailey said it quite well about what the Turkey Creek partners have been willing to do here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3413)|
| 0:56:59| because, golly, that was just really beginning to explode and happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3419)|
| 0:57:07| And, frankly, it isn't within the district I serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| It's an area where already there was enormous pollution of signage along Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| And with the numbers of businesses that were already committed to coming to Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3440)|
| 0:57:26| it just appeared that it was going to be a most unfortunate situation unless we looked at something very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| very creative that had never been done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| So the fact that they were willing to take that risk at a time when they were looking to find other tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3457)|
| 0:57:46| to complete their development, and it has certainly proven that the plan that they chose to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3466)|
| 0:57:56| has been absolutely the best thing they could have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3476)|
| 0:58:01| You know, when someone commented about the green space, I thought, oh, gee, but it is beautifully green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3481)|
| 0:58:08| They have incorporated the green space and developed it into the concept of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3488)|
| 0:58:14| And, of course, I've known that area since I was a child, and I'm so glad to see the wilderness area there, the wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3494)|
| 0:58:25| And all of these were concerns that people had when Turkey Creek was being considered to be annexed into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| and the city was going to go to the expense and the risk of putting in that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| It has been an incredible victory for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| and for those who were on this council at the time that Turkey Creek had its birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| But I have to say these gentlemen have been, they have really taken a risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3531)|
| 0:58:56| And at the time they had tenants who possibly were going to consider not becoming a part of Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| because they wouldn't have the exposure to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3544)|
| 0:59:09| And at the time it was discussed that, of course, taking down the billboards has enhanced the beauty of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3549)|
| 0:59:16| has enhanced, I think, their development totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| And then I have to say in the area that is in the city, on Lovell Road, it is just obviously impressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3559)|
| 0:59:27| what a difference it has made to take down all of the billboards, the double pylons and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| and kind of stack the signs and have less visual pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| So I feel that what they have been able to do successfully here is a great demonstration for other developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3579)|
| 0:59:52| who are considering developing large areas in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| And I really think that they have set a standard, as Mr. Stokes said, that others will want to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| So I think it behooves this council to appreciate what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| In looking at the size of the sign here, I have some problem with it for the same reason that we talked about the difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| with the size of the lettering and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| And it just appears to me that it is going to be a very crowded, very difficult to read sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3624)|
| 1:00:33| if they do not have substantive size on that sign, because the speed of traveling there is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3633)|
| 1:00:41| Already they are contractually obligated to three of the businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| And there needs to be room to safely be able to read any extra content they want to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3647)|
| 1:00:55| So, frankly, I travel that road every day because our business is located out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3655)|
| 1:01:04| So it just concerns me to see the lettering pushed and squeezed into such a small space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3664)|
| 1:01:16| And I really, in terms of the appearance, I feel that anything smaller than the 300 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3676)|
| 1:01:27| is certainly not going to be a wise decision for this council to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| I think Councilman Bailey has really hit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| We need to start looking at some planning that is going to have a relationship to the size of the tracks and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3695)|
| 1:01:44| and to the size of the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| But with the frontage, what it is there, and the speeds, what they are, because this is interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3706)|
| 1:01:51| This is not a city street that I think we need to give consideration to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3711)|
| 1:01:56| because I think there is a safety issue if the lettering is not large enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| or if it is too crowded and stacked too tightly on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| So that is the reason that I would believe that 300 square feet would be the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3725)|
| 1:02:13| 350 probably better just in terms of aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3738)|
| 1:02:19| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3739)|
| 1:02:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Alluding to Mr. Seymour's previous comments, I think the same standards should apply to the city of Nostal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| that I think should apply to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| I do take a little exception, as previously mentioned at an earlier meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| that if this proposal passes, they'll be advertising businesses that are located in the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3758)|
| 1:02:48| that does not allow signage like this in any manner whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| Also, I respectfully submit that even without this sign, you can tell what the businesses are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3775)|
| 1:03:04| some of the businesses are in Turkey Creek just from driving along the interstate itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| You see there's Gander Mountain, Best Buy, there's a Maytag store, there's Heritage Piano,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3789)|
| 1:03:18| and that's just to Ashley Furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| I mean, that's just to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| But you can see what's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| So it's not just the blank rear of buildings facing the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3811)|
| 1:03:37| Advertising is going on, which complies with the code, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Mr. Swanson, I have, I guess, a procedural question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| The 9B that's in front of us, it limits, it provides an exception to 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3826)|
| 1:03:54| If 9A passes tonight, that exception is 150 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3834)|
| 1:04:02| But if, I'm sorry, 9B, if 9B passes tonight, that exception is 150 square feet for Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3842)|
| 1:04:10| But if 9B fails tonight, that means there's no exception for Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3856)|
| 1:04:17| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3860)|
| 1:04:21| Any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Ms. Mitchell, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Go ahead, Councilmember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| I'd like to talk about amending this to allow for a larger sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| And, you know, I thought that we were kind of moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| But I would say it defeats the purpose of buying a sign from the business standpoint, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| if you only have a 150 square foot sign and nobody can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3890)|
| 1:04:56| And as Councilman Pelos said, I think that we've talked about safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| That is a safety issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| That's one of the reasons I oppose these EMCs in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| because when you're driving down Kingston Pike or some street and you have all kinds of traffic situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| and you look over and you start trying to read something, that's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3912)|
| 1:05:16| And if you're driving down the interstate and there's a 150 foot sign over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| and you can't read it, you know, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| I think it almost makes a mockery of the whole idea of what our intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| I mean, originally members said that this would give Turkey Creek an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3930)|
| 1:05:37| Well, we ought to come up with something that gives all areas of our community the opportunity to have an EMC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| and take down, you know, to incorporate a master sign plan and put up one EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| And then there wouldn't be an unfair advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| But, you know, I propose I'd like to ask Mr. Seymour, Mr. Bedwell, or whomever, what can you live with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3951)|
| 1:06:00| What can you live with? That's a hard question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| Three hundred feet, as Councilman Pelo stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3964)|
| 1:06:14| Well, I'll hear what others have to say, Mayor, and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| Ms. Roddy, I would contend that the compromise language that we have in front of us in 9B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| currently is appropriate and readable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| If you look at the diagrams that we've been provided as well as the ones on the sign board there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| currently the contractually obligated businesses that are advertised on the Turkey Creek monument sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| appear in this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| It's the gray section with the lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| And I've forgotten which businesses appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| Perhaps it's Walmart or Target.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| And I would submit that the names of those businesses are able to fit sufficiently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| one each on these four lines that are shown here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| And the size of that text would certainly be similar in size to the Support Knoxville College text| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4020)|
| 1:07:05| that we see on this mock-up tonight, if not bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4025)|
| 1:07:11| I think that the sign that we see here is sufficient in size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| It provides an opportunity for the smaller businesses in Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| to have the advertising exposure that they don't have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| That's why I'm willing to support this exception for a large master sign plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4042)|
| 1:07:27| I recognize the need for smaller businesses within this unified development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| to have an advertising presence on the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| I think, as Councilman Frost said, motorists can look down and see the large signage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4055)|
| 1:07:42| and logos that large-scale businesses put on their, quote, big box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4062)|
| 1:07:47| You can see the backside of Gander Mountain, and you can see where it says Gander Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| But the smaller restaurants and the smaller boutiques don't have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| And I think this electronic message sign, incorporated as part of their current sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4075)|
| 1:08:01| offers those businesses a fair opportunity while still preserving, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4081)|
| 1:08:08| the kind of environment that we supported with the passage of 9A in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| I agree with what Councilman Roddy just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| And one thing that baffles me is that their business model success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| was a disciplined, orderly approach to signage without EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4105)|
| 1:08:30| So their success actually proves that EMCs are not useful or really all that worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4110)|
| 1:08:39| So I'm not really sure why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| And I know that they are continuing to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| So I don't understand why they would even want what we're wanting to pass, because it is an icon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4127)|
| 1:08:55| because everybody does know where this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| And I think their success is their reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| So they were being rewarded by making a good judgment about building an attractive retail footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4143)|
| 1:09:13| And I can't imagine that you would want to go back in time and do it the other way with all the ugly signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4153)|
| 1:09:20| This proves that it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| And so you should be congratulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| May I respond briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| When we adopted a master sign overlay for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| the EMC technology that we're talking about here was not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4174)|
| 1:09:39| Tommy, can you address that issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4179)|
| 1:09:47| This is very new technology that basically it's not what you see on the digital billboards and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4187)|
| 1:09:56| So what we're talking about is a hugely expensive sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| The technology was simply not available at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Right now, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| Mayor, I'd like to offer an amendment to raise the matrix area from 150 feet to 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4209)|
| 1:10:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| There's a motion to change the area from 150 to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4219)|
| 1:10:23| Is that what you said, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4224)|
| 1:10:25| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4226)|
| 1:10:27| Further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Ready to vote on that then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| The motion is to change from 150 to 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4238)|
| 1:10:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| Mr. Beckham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| Mr. Seymour, Councilman Bailey asked what you can live with, and you said 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| Mr. Frost raised sort of an interesting point that this is an exemption for Turkey Creek, whether it's 100 feet or 150,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4247)|
| 1:10:56| and 150 is, as Ms. Roddy pointed out, a compromise with Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4256)|
| 1:11:03| Is your position that you can't live with less than 300?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| I'm not prepared to say that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| I'm talking about what, and perhaps I phrased my response to Councilman Bailey, I said we can live with 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4270)|
| 1:11:20| We started out with 400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| That's what MPC recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| I'm not going to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| You asked me that question the other day, and I said we would like to double what is in the ordinance now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4289)|
| 1:11:39| But I'm not going to say that's the absolute minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4299)|
| 1:11:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Well, I see Mr. Greave wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| I'm kind of curious as to what he wants to say, but I do want to make a comment after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| Mr. Greave, what would you like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4320)|
| 1:12:02| I would just like a clarification, if you folks could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| The way I understand the ordinance or the way I understand the code, you're allowed 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4327)|
| 1:12:13| If this sign goes, if the EMC is 300 square feet and the four signs below it are 150 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4333)|
| 1:12:21| we're already over 450 square feet, and that doesn't include the Turkey Creek sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| So, you know, I'd like to have some clarification on exactly what we're looking at in terms of a sign that does fall within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4347)|
| 1:12:35| the 400 square feet maximum that the ordinance allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| So if we could have some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Mr. Bedwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| As Vice Mayor Becker asked, we will have to comply to the sign ordinances and to all rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4362)|
| 1:12:53| So what does that look like then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4373)|
| 1:13:02| If everybody who's speaking could speak into a microphone just so we do have all that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| So what is the clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| What does the sign really look like if we have a 300 square foot EMC and we have 150 square feet of sign below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4388)|
| 1:13:15| and we have, I'm not sure how big the Turkey Creek sign is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| but it seems like the total sign for what we're talking about at this moment is over 400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| We would have to see if there can be a reduction in the three tenants, Wal-Mart, Target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4404)|
| 1:13:30| and CarMax, or try to reconfigure those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| If we have to leave them the same way, it's 250 feet, Duane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| That what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| The EMC would only be 250?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| I want to go back to Councilman Woodhull's remarks and Councilman Roddy's remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| I agree, I think, with what I heard from both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| First of all, Councilman Woodhull has pointed out that Turkey Creek has done phenomenally well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| as the applicants or as Mr. Seymour and his clients have suggested, and it's done well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4438)|
| 1:14:05| As far as I know, I don't see anyone here from any of the smaller boutique businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| but as far as I know, those are all doing fairly well, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| those other than Wal-Mart, Target, and CarMax, the ones advertised on the existing sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4454)|
| 1:14:22| So I think it really begs the question as to why we would need to do this at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| if they're doing so well without any signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| I'm not opposed totally to the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| I tend to want to go without EMCs at all, but I think the compromise is reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| and I try to be a reasonable person, so I'm willing to certainly consider a reasonable compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| But I think Councilman Roddy's statement was well put in that the signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4490)|
| 1:14:55| the fixed signs for those three anchor tenants that are on the bottom part of the sign have fonts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| or characters that are smaller than undoubtedly the same probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4503)|
| 1:15:09| They almost have to be smaller than the text you see that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| Support Knoxville College on the 150-square-foot matrix sign as indicated in the drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| And so if that's the case and those are readable, which they clearly are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| all of us that have driven by there know that they are readable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| and Councilman Roddy I think is absolutely correct that any text that's that size or larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| certainly if it's as brilliantly contrasted and highlighted as this quality of EMC would make it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4531)|
| 1:15:40| would be highly, highly visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| It certainly is visible or probably more visible than those existing signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| So, again, my tendency is to want no EMCs at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4546)|
| 1:15:51| I see very little justification for doing that, certainly in the case of Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| But being willing to seating Knoxville, everyone is willing to compromise on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4557)|
| 1:16:05| I think there's no indication at all that we need to go more than 150 square feet on a matrix sign like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4565)|
| 1:16:10| so I'm not going to support this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| I think we will all agree that Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola have been around for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| and they both have done very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| But every time you turn on the television set, Coke has a new commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| Pepsi has a new commercial because of changing times and changing demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4591)|
| 1:16:37| And I think this will be the problem at Turkey Creek as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| You know, we might know where it is now, those of us who go there, but there are others who don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| And so we have to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| We must keep up with the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4609)|
| 1:16:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| Mrs. Cash, is this considered a ground sign or a monument sign?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| It would be a ground sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| We're voting on the amendment now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| Okay, just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| We're voting on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Councilman Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| I heard four ayes and five noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| Okay, so the amendment fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| Okay, we're now going back to the motion as previously made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| Any further comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| Okay, ready to vote on that then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I was just going to say, would there be any consideration for a 250-foot sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| considering Mr. Greaves asked Mr. Seymour with the other signs involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4677)|
| 1:18:05| that would be the largest sign they could get anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| So I was just wondering, even if we passed the 300, you know, what would take place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| And furthermore, Mr. Seymour, do you want 150 feet or do you want nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| I mean, that's kind of where we're going here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Well, something is better than nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| Because I don't understand why, if you're going to put anything up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| why you don't give the businesses within there the opportunity to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| I think to Councilman Hultquist's question, we're talking about travelers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| people driving down our interstate, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| they see what's in there and they can go in there and they can spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| And that's how we fund our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| That's how we do things around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| And so anytime you can give businesses the opportunity to expand and grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4732)|
| 1:18:58| I think that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| And I don't see this, you know, doing any detrimental effect to our scenery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| or our beauty or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4745)|
| 1:19:08| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| But I'm for giving them the best chance to advertise they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4749)|
| 1:19:17| Two-fifty will give us a little more space here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| and would certainly make it a lot more visible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| and help us catch not only the people from Rowan County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| but the people from Mohi and Alabama and everywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Ms. Peele.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| Just to kind of follow up on the comment Councilman Bailey was making, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4770)|
| 1:19:35| I have to differ just a little bit with Councilman Frost's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4775)|
| 1:19:38| because do you realize that the businesses that you highlighted there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| are just about five or six?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| There can't be more than ten businesses that have frontage on I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| So, you know, we're overlooking all the other large anchors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| that are a part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4799)|
| 1:20:01| We're certainly overlooking all the smaller shops, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4801)|
| 1:20:07| they're struggling, battling to survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| and for people to be aware of the fact that they're located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| And, you know, I come from a small business background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| and I guess maybe that's why I always want to kind of battle for the small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4819)|
| 1:20:23| to be able to make it and not just for those national chains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4823)|
| 1:20:28| But I just wanted to comment on that because you rightly indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| and CarMax is one of those businesses which is already advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| You know, we are really eliminating the opportunity periodically for some of those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| which would like to make a special advertisement to have the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4844)|
| 1:20:51| And so I guess I'm like Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| I just don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| But, you know, it's been an interesting discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4855)|
| 1:21:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4861)|
| 1:21:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| Mr. Swanson, if we vote to amend to 250 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| we'd be going back to first reading, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| That would be a substantive change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| So, yes, you'd be going back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| It would have been anyway if we'd gone to 300.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| I'll make the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| I'll make an amendment that we change the minimum matrix size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| maximum matrix size from 150 feet to 250 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4884)|
| 1:21:30| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| A motion for 150 to 250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| Now this, just as Council said, that would take us back to first reading with that change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4894)|
| 1:21:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| Any further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| Anything else, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4907)|
| 1:21:48| Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4911)|
| 1:21:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4912)|
| 1:21:53| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4915)|
| 1:21:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4917)|
| 1:21:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| So that passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Did I have that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| That passes five to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| So we're back on the motion as amended just now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4929)|
| 1:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Further discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| So this becomes first reading now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| It becomes first reading now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Rather than second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4944)|
| 1:22:25| So we're now on an amended motion that has gone from second to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4952)|
| 1:22:33| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| Mrs. Cash, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Reading the sign ordinance, it says a ground or monument sign shall not be located within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4956)|
| 1:22:40| 2,000 feet of the right-of-way of a scenic highway or scenic parkway unless such sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| is 195 square feet or less in surface area and is 35 feet or less in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4964)|
| 1:22:53| Now there are some exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| What exception applies to this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4975)|
| 1:23:00| I don't believe that I-40, I-75 is a scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| I was talking to Mrs. Poplin beforehand because there was an issue before any of us got on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4984)|
| 1:23:08| council concerning a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| That was Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4994)|
| 1:23:15| It was up there at Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Are you talking about the one at the Mercedes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=4999)|

| 1:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5004)|

| 1:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| We're going to vote on the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| I just want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| If this motion as amended fails, then it fails altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| And if it passes, then it passes on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| If it fails, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| There's no exception for Turkey Creek at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Not the smaller hundred that was proposed originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| You have nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| And not the 150 that we had a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5041)|
| 1:24:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| Just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| I'm going to be voting against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| I've always had concerns about how blunt an instrument this is for planning, sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| saying, you know, at some level of 100 acres, you get so many square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| I think we've got to be a lot more sophisticated in how we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| I think there is a need for advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| This just seems awfully blunt because, again, it's anybody that's got 100 acres and a master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| sign plan, no matter what kind of area they're in, gets an EMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| And I don't think that's the way we need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| Councilman Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5071)|
| 1:24:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| And I'd like at some point to propose back to the MPC on how we go about some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| a graduated sign plan per acreage and per overlay where there's a master sign in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5080)|
| 1:24:46| I think that's the next step we need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| But I think this is a first good step, and it's a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| Although I opposed both amendments to 9B this evening, I plan to support this item as amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5096)|
| 1:25:04| on first reading tonight for the sake of keeping something alive for the small businesses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| I'd like to continue to discuss how this has been amended on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| I'm not comfortable with the 250 square feet, but I'm not willing to kill it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| So I will support this amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5123)|

| 1:27:10| I believe we all received something from the developer of the North Shore property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5230)|
| 1:27:20| There is a bit of a problem, and Mr. Donaldson can help us with this if we need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| They have some leases that are to be signed and some tenants that have been wishing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5246)|

| 1:28:10| day period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5290)|

| 1:36:01| I don't plan to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| I haven't done anything in the past and I don't currently plan on doing anything in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| the future, but I know that Councilmembers make plans and make commitments and if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| wish to use this money, then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| This is a very, very minute amount of money in the scale of our budget and I don't plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| I'll say amen to all of Councilman Bailey's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5788)|
| 1:36:29| Councilman Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5789)|
| 1:36:30| And I say so too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5790)|
| 1:36:31| It might be a drop in the bucket in the City Council budget or the City's budget, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| means a lot to an organization struggling out there for a small amount of help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| Other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| Councilman Booker, this is, you're actually addressing 12B, this one was 12A regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5808)|
| 1:36:57| travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Well, even ditto about that too, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Any further comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| Ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| I heard two, I heard Frost and Roddy as ayes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Were there any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5832)|
| 1:37:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| All those opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| I'm assuming the other seven are all nos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| The motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| 12B is an ordinance to amend the 2008-09 operating budget of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| so as to delete all remaining funds of the Community Improvement 202 fund requested by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| Councilmember Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| Well, there's actually not a second yet, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5854)|
| 1:37:43| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5863)|
| 1:37:44| Going once, going twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| Mayor, may I speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| I think rules will out-permit that, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| I'm not speaking to this ordinance either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| I was going to ask to recuse myself because I don't have 202 funds in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| The last two years, I've requested not to have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| I was mistakenly allocated some this year, but at the budget amendment ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| we passed two weeks ago, my funds were deleted, so I don't think it's appropriate for me to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| vote on the expenditures of others' allocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Councilman Bailey, I think I saw your light next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| I'm not certain if the rules allow for me to speak to something if it doesn't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| I mean, I can't actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Our rules actually do allow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5909)|
| 1:38:31| Yeah, because think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5911)|
| 1:38:32| We let people talk before we have a motion, even on the floor, so I think Council has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| that prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| Well, I was actually going to say, I mean, I saw the beginning of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| I watched the video, even though I wasn't here two weeks ago, and I like the way Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5920)|
| 1:38:45| Frost started by saying this is something that's worth thinking about, so I was actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| if the rules didn't allow that, I was going to second it so we could have the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5932)|
| 1:38:53| But if the rules allow discussion to happen, we'll go that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Well, I'll go ahead and second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5939)|
| 1:39:00| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| And I'd just like to say that I am not a major supporter of grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5941)|
| 1:39:08| I think grants are necessary in a lot of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5948)|
| 1:39:11| These funds can be utilized in a number of positive ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5951)|
| 1:39:16| I'm not one that supports taking tax dollars and then redistributing them because we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5956)|
| 1:39:21| best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| Having said that, we do receive these 202 funds, and what I try to do is I put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| a criteria and a process to follow, and I try to use those tax dollars in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5968)|
| 1:39:34| not only are utilized one year, but two years, three years down the road and are sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| shared by other city, but by a number of city agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| And I had committed my funds back several months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5985)|
| 1:39:49| I'm not certain that other council members have committed their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| I don't know if there was an effort made to check to see if those funds were committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| and how so, and to what was it committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| But I think a lot of these are very necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| I think mine is a good way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6005)|
| 1:40:09| And what I'd like to do is I'd like to amend this to allow for any council member that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| wishes to voluntarily put their money back into the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6013)|
| 1:40:22| Of course, if we don't spend it, it goes back into the general fund anyway, but since we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| do have a resolution on the table, I'd like to amend it to say that any council member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6027)|
| 1:40:33| who elects to can do so in writing and file it with the city recorder's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| So I'd like to amend this resolution to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| Second the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| Okay, we're now speaking to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| You still want to comment on that, Mr. Becker, or you want to go back to, still want to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| about it a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Ms. Pelow, on the amendment or on the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| I'll speak to the amendment because I think that may be a very fine way to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6054)|
| 1:41:00| I think most of us have committed our funds in the way that we feel comfortable about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6060)|
| 1:41:07| I have some funds that have not been spent, but they are committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| And, you know, this is a very difficult time for a lot of agencies in the city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6071)|
| 1:41:19| And, gee, I would just, I would not feel comfortable not being in a position to assist some neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6079)|
| 1:41:28| some organizations that I feel are really providing a great service to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| And I've tried over these past seven years to utilize these funds in that way where hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| it would allow a group to expand their services or to have some money with which to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6102)|
| 1:41:51| if they're starting a neighborhood organization or so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| So I find that they're very appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| I find that they are spent in a very wise way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| And I found this council to be very responsible about how they have appropriated those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| And I'm just going to speak on behalf of the organizations that I think are grateful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6128)|
| 1:42:14| we are in a position to provide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6134)|
| 1:42:16| But I will ditto Councilman Bailey's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6136)|
| 1:42:21| If anyone feels they would like to turn them back in, I think that should be their discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| I guess I'm going to vote against this because it seems kind of bizarre to amend something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6149)|
| 1:42:33| to allow us to do what we can do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| And I'd sort of like to hear from Mr. Frost about the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| And I've got some just some bigger concerns about the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| But as far as I don't, it just doesn't make sense to do that because that's, anybody can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| do that anytime they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Can I answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| Respond to that, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6175)|
| 1:42:56| Why don't we do it and then I'll come back to you, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| I didn't realize, I didn't see a reason to do it in the first place, which is the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| if some feel like a resolution is the path to go to put the money back in there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| then let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| But addressing Mr. Bailey's amendment, I think because we're dealing with the budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6193)|
| 1:43:19| you would actually have to place it on an agenda and your specific motion just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6199)|
| 1:43:24| write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| When you're dealing with money, I mean, we have to, you know, deal with land transactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6205)|
| 1:43:30| that are the properties being given, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| So I'd respectfully, Mr. Swanson, just ask you, if we're dealing with budgetary items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6213)|
| 1:43:38| doesn't this council have to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I mean, you prepared a budget amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| And Mr. Bailey's saying, take a budget amendment, write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6225)|
| 1:43:50| He's amending the budget amendment to say it's essentially voluntary to each council member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6230)|
| 1:43:56| but if they're going to turn their funds back in and the funds go ahead and be transferred back to the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| then they've got to do it in writing, filed with the city recorder's office is what he's saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6242)|
| 1:44:09| Otherwise, the money stays in the account and either the council member spends it or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6249)|
| 1:44:19| or ask you folks to spend it on their behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| For Mr. Becker's, Vice Mayor Becker's history, I guess the point about this is that there are a lot of businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6264)|
| 1:44:35| and we've heard about plenty of businesses tonight struggling, and as I said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6275)|
| 1:44:41| this is, for the most part, a symbolic gesture that the city is watching resources, no more, no less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6281)|
| 1:44:53| You know, a lot of folks on city council are good about, you know, fairly equitably distributing the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6293)|
| 1:45:04| these funds to different groups all over town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6304)|
| 1:45:08| But that's, I mean, just to be blunt about it, and, I mean, this addresses something that Mr. Bailey has on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6308)|
| 1:45:18| My son plays in Knox U Sports, but over the past few years, there have been $7,000 and $8,000 contributions to one organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6318)|
| 1:45:31| I mean, personally, I think the children who play in Knox U Sports deserve the same sort of equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6331)|
| 1:45:40| and facilities as the kids that play at Fountain City Ballpark, Christenberry, Badgett Field, Rock City, and other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6340)|
| 1:45:50| So, you know, that does bother me a little bit, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6350)|
| 1:45:57| I just think that if council members think that this is important to them, then let them decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| I know Councilman Frost has been here when I've made those commitments and contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| and one of the things I've stressed is that over at KYS, boys and girls from all over the city utilize that park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6374)|
| 1:46:23| And not only that, there are a number of programs over there for disabled children that don't go on anywhere else in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| And I know Councilman Frost in the past has given money to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| I've tried to articulate the other aspect of KYS, which is they bring in tournaments that bring in moms and dads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6394)|
| 1:46:44| and kids from all over the state and around the country that come in here and stay in our hotels and spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6404)|
| 1:46:50| That's economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6410)|
| 1:46:52| But that park down there is a great asset to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| And if I need to, I'll try to get the KYS people up here to talk about their overall broad program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6415)|
| 1:47:03| So, I don't think in my memory anybody singled out any sort of contribution to any agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| And I've looked and reviewed other council members' contributions, and a lot of them I would never give taxpayers' dollars to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6429)|
| 1:47:17| But, you know, just to me, if you want to put your money back in it, then we'll pass this amendment here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6437)|
| 1:47:26| Put your money back in there, what's left of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| I think you've spent about 60 percent or more, Councilman Frost, and just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| That's the best way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| Okay. Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Ready to vote, then. Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| There is a motion to amend on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| Do you want me to specify exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6466)|
| 1:47:47| If you could, yeah, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6467)|
| 1:47:49| In section one, I'd like to delete the last part of that sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| with the remaining balance and such fund to be transferred to the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| and replace it with, for any council member who so elects, comma, in writing, comma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| filed with the city recorder, comma, or period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| Okay. Ready to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6488)|
| 1:48:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| Just to be clear, Mr. Swanson, as you're writing that down, do we still leave the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6493)|
| 1:48:22| Does that make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| Does that do what Mr. Bailey wants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Can I just speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| I think if you do it in writing, then the city knows they have that three or four dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| I just want to make sure you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| It goes back into the balance fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| That's the way to notify it needs to be transferred back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| That's okay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Probably my preference would be to leave the language with the remaining balance and such fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| to be transferred to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| But it would only be for those council members who elect to do so in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| That just specifies that the money then goes back once they make that election in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| So I would leave that last language there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| But whichever way you want to do it, it's your amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| So just insert, for any council member who so elects, in writing, filed with the city recorder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6542)|
| 1:49:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6547)|
| 1:49:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| I guess I'm still concerned about the language that says the operating budget is amended by deleting therefrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6556)|
| 1:49:23| And the language he's got really doesn't delete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| It only deletes it for those who elect to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| That's what the amendment does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6571)|
| 1:49:32| Then we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6572)|
| 1:49:33| I'm happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6573)|
| 1:49:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6574)|
| 1:49:35| We'll try a voice vote first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6579)|
| 1:49:40| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| I heard Becker and a Frost as a no and a Holquist as a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Three noes, one recuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6590)|
| 1:49:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6591)|
| 1:49:52| Mr. Holquist, were you yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| So I have five ayes, three noes, and one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6595)|
| 1:49:59| The noes were Becker, Frost, and Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6602)|
| 1:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6605)|
| 1:50:07| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| Yeah, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6609)|
| 1:50:11| Again, I'm glad this got raised, Mr. Frost, because it is sort of fair to say in a time like this what's our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6611)|
| 1:50:17| And I thought about this actually when I was watching the video of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| It's sort of the sense of the question you're asking that comes to this answer, which is sort of how do we save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6621)|
| 1:50:27| And I think in a way that's the wrong question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| I mean, the question we should be asking is how do we respond to the economic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| And I guess I'm going to go out very much on a limb because you're right, there are people suffering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6633)|
| 1:50:38| and we need to be good stewards of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| But the city of Knoxville is also in really good financial shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| We have done stuff over the years that has meant we're not facing significant deficits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| and we have lots of money in the bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| We have chosen, you know, the 202 funds used to be at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6655)|
| 1:50:59| Now they're at $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6659)|
| 1:51:01| We're eliminating $270,000 in every budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| So holding this even with the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| But the key is it feels like we need to be thinking differently about how to take advantage of the economic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| One of my favorite movies is It's a Wonderful Life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| And there's that great scene where Mr. Potter says, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| Bailey, you and I were the only two who kept our heads in the panic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| You saved the building and loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| I saved everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| I think we need to do a much better job in 202s, but also I'll challenge the administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| looking for those opportunities to get really good bang for our buck in our spending now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| With the economy down, prices of asphalt ought to be down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| Prices of construction ought to be down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6705)|
| 1:51:47| Sidewalks ought to be down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Now is the time, I think, and I'll say this publicly and we're coming up on budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6709)|
| 1:51:53| we should be looking at actually spending more money, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6713)|
| 1:51:56| Because now we can go out and if we can find a way to spend a little more money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6716)|
| 1:52:01| and get twice the bang for the buck, we should take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| The mayor has always been great about saying spend a little money now or spend a lot of money later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| I think this is an opportunity for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| And I want to have this as a chance to say that publicly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| And I think I warned Jim York beforehand to be sitting down when I spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| But I think the mentality on this is we don't need to be worried about money now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6741)|
| 1:52:26| We need to be thinking about opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Now we're back to the motion as amended, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6759)|
| 1:52:40| Were those the same three nos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| I'm no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6766)|
| 1:52:47| And then one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Could you do that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6770)|
| 1:52:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| All those opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| Holquist, Frost, Becker, and abstention by Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Five ayes, three noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| I'm sorry, recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| The amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6784)|
| 1:53:05| No, that's the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6790)|

| 1:53:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090324?start=6815)|
