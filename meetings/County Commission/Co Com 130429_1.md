| 2:55:26| I need feedback from you all as to where you want to go from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10526)|
| 2:55:30| Do you want to wait for 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| Do you want to go with agriculture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10532)|
| 2:55:33| Do you want to go with planned residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| I guess I'm looking for feedback from you all and, of course, the developer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10535)|
| 2:55:39| But I guess that my point is, is that we're kind of going down the path of one unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10539)|
| 2:55:45| But you live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| And so the decision that we make is going to affect you for the rest of your lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10548)|
| 2:55:52| and your property, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| So I guess that's why I'm kind of looking to see, okay, I want to make sure that I'm making the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10554)|
| 2:56:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| Would you like to speak, Mr. Schmierbaum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10566)|
| 2:56:07| Five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10567)|
| 2:56:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10568)|
| 2:56:09| And would you go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| Are you ready, Amy, or do you have the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| I would like to make a comment that might help, too, with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10573)|
| 2:56:17| is that we're all saying that we think planned residential would be the way to go, but we don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10577)|
| 2:56:24| They may want to keep it agricultural so that they only have one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10584)|
| 2:56:29| That may be the way that they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10589)|
| 2:56:31| If we go ahead and vote planned residential tonight, they're also locked into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10591)|
| 2:56:37| And the developer is not under any constraints to do anything the way that they want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10597)|
| 2:56:42| I think the thing that gives this community the most flexibility going forward is to defer this for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10602)|
| 2:56:51| and let them be able to meet and have plenty of time to discuss it without a five-minute recess right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10611)|
| 2:56:59| to understand what their options are, and then come back in 60 days and tell us do they want it agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10619)|
| 2:57:05| or do they want it planned residential with density of one unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| That's what gives this community the most flexibility, if that's what we're interested in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10629)|
| 2:57:15| That's why I would like to withdraw my substitute motion and put that one forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10635)|
| 2:57:24| In that case, I will withdraw my second to your original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10644)|
| 2:57:27| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| So my substitute motion, then, is that we defer this for 60 days to give them an opportunity to meet at their leisure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10649)|
| 2:57:36| and have all their questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10663)|
| 2:57:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10664)|
| 2:57:50| Mr. Wood commented that all of the correspondence we received pertaining to this particular piece of property was to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10670)|
| 2:58:02| Commissioner Wright, did you meet with the what's the sense of the folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10682)|
| 2:58:07| I second the motion that we defer for until month after next, whatever the, not the days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10687)|
| 2:58:14| but the meeting two months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10694)|
| 2:58:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10702)|
| 2:58:23| So any other things before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| I just had one other question in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10705)|
| 2:58:28| And, Mr. Schmierbach, you might be able to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| In consideration of planned residential, that is kind of my preference, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10712)|
| 2:58:39| Are there features, are there slopes or creeks or features that you're particularly interested in retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10719)|
| 2:58:47| or protecting or buffering in this, you know, in the development process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10727)|
| 2:58:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10733)|
| 2:58:54| There's a large spring immediately across Shackleford Road that is also a location of a major drainway from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10734)|
| 2:59:05| So the potential for contaminating that spring or the surface waters at that spring are pretty high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10745)|
| 2:59:12| and there's also a spring on the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10752)|
| 2:59:15| There's a stream on the property at the western end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10755)|
| 2:59:18| but it's our understanding that they were planning on avoiding that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| So the surface water features, particularly this large spring, it's called Plummer Spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10764)|
| 2:59:30| if you looked on a topo map, is a fairly significant resource, and we'd hate to see it destroyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10770)|
| 2:59:42| And it looks like the only drainway from the eastern end of the property would come right down to the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10782)|
| 2:59:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10788)|
| 2:59:49| And does the spring feed a creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| It does feed a creek, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10792)|
| 2:59:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10793)|
| 2:59:54| Is there associated wetland with that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10794)|
| 3:00:00| Not to my knowledge, but there is wetland further upstream from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10800)|
| 3:00:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10810)|
| 3:00:11| Well, significant features to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10813)|
| 3:00:14| Our motion before us is to defer this until the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10817)|
| 3:00:20| Mr. Campbell, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| I conferred briefly with the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10822)|
| 3:00:24| and he indicates that he still feels like planned residential is the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10824)|
| 3:00:28| He is amenable to the one unit per acre motion that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10828)|
| 3:00:36| If we defer it 60 days, then that's going to put him under stress with his partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10836)|
| 3:00:41| So I don't know what to expect out of what's going to come from our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10841)|
| 3:00:45| But that's just what's on his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10845)|
| 3:00:50| Do we need another caucus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10850)|
| 3:00:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10853)|
| 3:00:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10854)|
| 3:00:55| So the motion before us is 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10859)|
| 3:01:00| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| He's ready to go now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10862)|
| 3:01:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10865)|
| 3:01:11| I'm against two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10871)|
| 3:01:12| I mean, I think we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10872)|
| 3:01:14| I mean, this is what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| And it's just so we can go ahead and start the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10876)|
| 3:01:19| And it's going to be hard to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| It's hard to get things going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10881)|
| 3:01:22| And I think this is the way we're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10882)|
| 3:01:24| We're just putting off the inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10884)|
| 3:01:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10887)|
| 3:01:28| The community is going to get a better deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10888)|
| 3:01:30| Votes cast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10890)|
| 3:01:34| Eight-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10894)|
| 3:01:35| It will be 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10895)|
| 3:01:42| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10902)|
| 3:01:43| The next item is 3-B-13-RZ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| request of Todd Howard for rezoning from RA Low Density Residential to OA Office Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10906)|
| 3:01:51| The property is located northeast side of South Peters Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10911)|
| 3:01:54| northwest of Sunny Lane in the 3rd Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10914)|
| 3:01:59| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10919)|
| 3:02:02| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| 3035 Port Royal Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| My name is Danny Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10925)|
| 3:02:06| I'm here on behalf of the applicant, Todd Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10926)|
| 3:02:10| This is really just a rezoning to bring this property into compliance with other adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10930)|
| 3:02:15| and adjoining properties along Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| This property was bought in December at a Knox County auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10937)|
| 3:02:22| Knox County was actually using it as an office, I think, through the Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10942)|
| 3:02:28| My client bought the property and is in the process of making repairs to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10948)|
| 3:02:34| And we thought in order to lease it for its proper use that we should get it under the proper zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10954)|
| 3:02:40| because typically tenants want a zoning letter before they want to use a property for a particular office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10960)|
| 3:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10967)|
| 3:02:48| Thank you, Mr. Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10968)|
| 3:02:49| Did we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| No opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10971)|
| 3:02:52| It was on our consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10972)|
| 3:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10974)|
| 3:02:55| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10975)|
| 3:02:56| And, Danny, thanks for getting it back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10976)|
| 3:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10980)|
| 3:03:01| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10981)|
| 3:03:04| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10984)|
| 3:03:05| Per MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10985)|
| 3:03:06| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10988)|
| 3:03:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10991)|
| 3:03:12| Thank you, Mr. Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10992)|
| 3:03:13| You have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| 12-B-12-SP is a request of Knox County Commission for Northeast County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=10995)|
| 3:03:22| and RR Agricultural Rural Residential and NC Neighborhood Commercial to RC Rural Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11002)|
| 3:03:28| located at northeast side of Tillett Lane, northeast of Corrington Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11008)|
| 3:03:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11016)|
| 3:03:37| Mr. Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11017)|
| 3:03:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11019)|
| 3:03:40| Am I supposed to say a move for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| That would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11026)|
| 3:03:47| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11027)|
| 3:03:48| Per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11030)|
| 3:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11031)|
| 3:03:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11032)|
| 3:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11033)|

| 3:03:55| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11035)|
| 3:03:56| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11036)|
| 3:03:57| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| We need to have some discussion here because there are two things that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| One is a plan or rezoning and the other is a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11042)|
| 3:04:09| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11049)|
| 3:04:13| If not, we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| Yes, we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| If I agree with MPC, I think we can do this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11057)|
| 3:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11064)|
| 3:04:25| Who is the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11065)|
| 3:04:27| Jack Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11067)|
| 3:04:28| Oh, this is the Walker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11070)|
| 3:04:31| I mean, per the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| Yeah, the county commission is actually the applicant on the plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11073)|
| 3:04:37| The plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11077)|
| 3:04:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11078)|
| 3:04:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11079)|
| 3:04:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| I do not have a map before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11082)|
| 3:04:46| But this has been before us for three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| What has happened is that there are two adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| each having a panned handle that runs beside the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11094)|
| 3:04:59| This particular one, Walker was wanting to have RB rezoned rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11099)|
| 3:05:10| And we, because the rest of his property was rural commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11110)|
| 3:05:17| the adjacent property owner did not desire that to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11117)|
| 3:05:22| but has a panned handle of his own which runs beside Walker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| which I believe I can request the Metropolitan Planning Commission to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11128)|
| 3:05:37| I believe it was actually suggested by MPC that if they would trade panned handles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11137)|
| 3:05:43| then the two property owners would have more rectangular pieces of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11143)|
| 3:05:49| the residential all being RB and the commercial all being rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11149)|
| 3:05:57| The property owners today have signed an agreement to make that happen pending what we're doing here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11157)|
| 3:06:05| So I think on this particular one, this first one, we just have to approve it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11165)|
| 3:06:13| So you have today in front of you the original requests from Mr. Walker for his property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11173)|
| 3:06:21| which was to change the land use plan and change the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11181)|
| 3:06:27| You can approve those per the MPC recommendation as the first step in making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11187)|
| 3:06:34| And in doing so, request that MPC initiate a plan amendment and zoning for the Ingram property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11194)|
| 3:06:41| which is the property that Mr. Walker will be receiving as part of his trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11201)|
| 3:06:47| And we'll get that started and get it back to you by your July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11207)|
| 3:06:53| And that is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11213)|
| 3:06:57| There's mud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11220)|
| 3:07:01| We've got the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11221)|
| 3:07:04| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11228)|
| 3:07:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| 9A-12-RZ is a request of Jack Walker for rezoning from RB General Residential to CR Rural Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11237)|
| 3:07:25| located on the northeast side of Tillett Lane, northeast of Corrington Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11245)|
| 3:07:31| And I believe this is just withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11251)|
| 3:07:34| No, you want to approve this per the MPC recommendation as well because on a portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11254)|
| 3:07:40| we need to rezone it from RB to CR, but not all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11260)|
| 3:07:44| Move to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| Well, I think on this one the applicant needs to be here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11267)|
| 3:07:50| Applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11270)|
| 3:07:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11271)|
| 3:07:52| MPC is saying they can handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11272)|
| 3:07:56| It always had to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11276)|
| 3:07:57| It had to be here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| Yeah, I thought this looks like it's from Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11279)|
| 3:08:07| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11287)|
| 3:08:11| This is a piece of property that he is transferring, he is selling, he is trading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11291)|
| 3:08:19| This is part of the original application from Mr. Walker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11299)|
| 3:08:24| It is your rule that applicants have to be at the meeting in order to act on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11304)|
| 3:08:33| You have the right to waive your rules, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11313)|
| 3:08:41| I just think that's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| I think we're going to get on a slippery slope if we start suspending the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11323)|
| 3:08:46| and make it optional for the applicant, to be quite honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11326)|
| 3:08:50| I'm sure it's going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11330)|
| 3:08:51| I'm sure it will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| But I just think that's a dangerous precedent for us to start personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11332)|
| 3:08:57| The actual result of this is no result, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11337)|
| 3:09:01| Nothing will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11341)|
| 3:09:04| Yes, we are changing the zoning map for a portion of his property through this act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11344)|
| 3:09:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11349)|
| 3:09:10| Not the panhandle, the pan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11354)|
| 3:09:16| Move to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11356)|
| 3:09:17| That sounds like the good part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11357)|
| 3:09:18| Move to defer for one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11358)|
| 3:09:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11359)|
| 3:09:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11364)|
| 3:09:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11365)|
| 3:09:26| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11366)|
| 3:09:27| Deferred one month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11367)|
| 3:09:36| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| The next item will be on page 21 because the first zoning ordinance has been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11379)|
| 3:09:47| This is Ordinance O-13-4-102, amending Article 2 and Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11387)|
| 3:09:55| Appendix A of the Knox County Code, to regulate electronic message center signs in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11401)|
| 3:10:09| And this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11413)|
| 3:10:14| We had several people that wanted to speak on this one, Ms. Klein and Ms. Feld and Mr. Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11414)|
| 3:10:23| Do we need to have a motion before we talk about it since this is a little different than a zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11423)|
| 3:10:29| I think we need to do this since it's an ordinance or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11429)|
| 3:10:32| And then if we want to make a substitute motion, we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| Mr. Law Director, do we need a motion before we start this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11436)|
| 3:10:40| I think commission rules do say that you need a motion before you discuss the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11440)|
| 3:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11444)|
| 3:10:45| Dr. Briggs, would you like to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11445)|
| 3:10:46| I'm going to make a motion to approve so we can go ahead and start the discussion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11446)|
| 3:10:53| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11453)|
| 3:10:54| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11454)|
| 3:10:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11455)|
| 3:10:56| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11456)|
| 3:10:58| We'll go ahead and start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11458)|
| 3:10:59| Ms. Klein or Ms. Feld, would you all like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11459)|
| 3:11:02| Or Mr. Rankin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11462)|
| 3:11:03| It makes no difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11466)|
| 3:11:09| My name is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| I live at 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11471)|
| 3:11:18| Scenic Knoxville supports restrictions on the operating characteristics of electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11478)|
| 3:11:27| To date, we've only been subjected to a small sample of the capabilities of these digital signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11487)|
| 3:11:33| These signs are capable of everything a TV or movie screen can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11493)|
| 3:11:38| We already have EMCs that flash and scroll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11498)|
| 3:11:41| but if you've seen a jumbotron at a sporting event or been to Pigeon Forge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11501)|
| 3:11:46| you know what else they're capable of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| The same aesthetic and safety issues that apply to digital billboards apply to EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11509)|
| 3:11:56| They're unsightly and distracting to drivers and pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11516)|
| 3:12:02| It's logical to assume that the growing body of data that shows how unsafe digital billboards are extends to EMCs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11522)|
| 3:12:12| We support the same regulations enacted in the city of Knoxville in 2009, with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11532)|
| 3:12:20| As currently written, a maximum size of 10 by 10, or 100 square feet, is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11540)|
| 3:12:28| This is a very large digital sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11548)|
| 3:12:31| To me, it looks more like a small digital billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11551)|
| 3:12:37| I'm not very good at judging measurements, but I was, for comparison's sake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11557)|
| 3:12:43| I was trying to figure out how big the lighted area of that screen is, and maybe someone actually knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11563)|
| 3:12:50| I'm going to estimate 8 by 8. Does that sound reasonable to anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11570)|
| 3:12:56| You think it's smaller?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11576)|
| 3:13:02| It's bigger than 8 by 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11582)|
| 3:13:07| That's a 12 foot wide screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11587)|
| 3:13:12| 12 by 9? Well, I don't know, and I don't think anybody's going to get up there and measure it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11592)|
| 3:13:17| But that will give you a reference point anyway for a 10 by 10 EMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11597)|
| 3:13:23| and I think you can see that that's a really big digital sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11603)|
| 3:13:28| If you look at some of the EMCs that we have around town, for instance, Sonic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11608)|
| 3:13:33| which is very bright and very noticeable, it's much smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11613)|
| 3:13:39| I think the Walgreen signs, I'm not sure how big they are exactly, but they're much smaller than 10 by 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11619)|
| 3:13:45| So I would like to propose a maximum size of about 20 or 25 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11625)|
| 3:13:52| These signs are a part of the arms race to have the brightest, most attention grabbing sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11632)|
| 3:13:57| Unfortunately, though, when there are too many, it just becomes a jumbled mess of ugly, distracting signs that no one can see clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11637)|
| 3:14:06| The only winners are the sign companies that make and sell them, and most of these aren't even located in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11646)|
| 3:14:13| This isn't just the opinion of a small number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| This is a change that the people of Knox County want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11656)|
| 3:14:20| You received hundreds of emails from your constituents a few months ago expressing this opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11660)|
| 3:14:27| People are really tired of being bombarded by these garish signs, and they're counting on you to make a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11667)|
| 3:14:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11674)|
| 3:14:36| Thank you, Ms. Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11676)|
| 3:14:38| Ms. Klein, would you like to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11678)|
| 3:14:46| Hello. Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane, Knoxville 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11686)|
| 3:14:53| I'm the president of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11693)|
| 3:14:56| I don't have a whole lot to add to what Ms. Feld said, except that the Council of West Knox County Homeowners did vote two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11696)|
| 3:15:06| and unanimously, all those who were present, approved the restriction on such things as the brightness, the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11706)|
| 3:15:17| whether they blink or flash, with the idea that there would be some conformity with what the city currently has in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11717)|
| 3:15:26| And, again, one thing that Ms. Feld didn't point out is that the city has banned all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11726)|
| 3:15:33| and that right now we're not asking to have them banned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11733)|
| 3:15:37| We're just asking to have them regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11737)|
| 3:15:41| And the fact that the sizing currently is extremely large has no bearing in the city because they can't have them at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11741)|
| 3:15:51| So we would absolutely need to have something added, not just the adoption of the city's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11751)|
| 3:15:58| but something added to talk about the size that's allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| And, as Joyce said, I believe that those sonic signs are about five by four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11761)|
| 3:16:09| You know, that's five by four twenty square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11769)|
| 3:16:12| Those are really pretty big and pretty noticeable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11772)|
| 3:16:15| So that seems like a pretty big sign to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11775)|
| 3:16:17| And, to be honest, most people aren't keen on that, but we understand that merchants want to be able to advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11777)|
| 3:16:24| And we just ask for some reasonable compromises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11784)|
| 3:16:30| One thing that I know is true in West County, and I think it's probably true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11790)|
| 3:16:35| certainly out Clinton Highway and some areas, maybe Chapman Highway, is that because of finger annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11795)|
| 3:16:43| there is one parcel of land that's still in the county, and right next to it there's a parcel in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11803)|
| 3:16:50| and then the one next to that's in the county, and then you're back to the city again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11810)|
| 3:16:53| So it only seems reasonable to have the standards be the same for city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11813)|
| 3:16:59| Because as you're driving down Kingston Pike or Cedar Bluff is another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11819)|
| 3:17:04| you don't know whether you just pass this piece of land that's in the city and the next one's in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11824)|
| 3:17:09| And it doesn't seem fair to one merchant to be able to have a great big bright flashy one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11829)|
| 3:17:14| and the guy next to him to have a little bitty, you know, one that holds for 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11834)|
| 3:17:19| So we're asking for the 60-second hold time and the standards that were applied in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11839)|
| 3:17:27| Otherwise, as Joyce said, you've got a lot of letters about people not liking the digital, you know, distractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11847)|
| 3:17:34| This kind of applies, and we feel like it's a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11854)|
| 3:17:37| We appreciate all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11858)|
| 3:17:39| Thanks, Ms. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11859)|
| 3:17:42| We have some other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11862)|
| 3:17:43| Mr. Rankin, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11863)|
| 3:17:56| My name is Sam Rankin, 320 Trossick Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11876)|
| 3:18:00| I'm not real sure today what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11880)|
| 3:18:03| We already have regulations that we're trying to vote on, but I have no idea what's in this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11883)|
| 3:18:11| And passing these new regulations is like Nancy Pelosi saying we have to pass Obamacare so we can see what's in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11891)|
| 3:18:17| Nobody in the industry or any business owners that I know of were included in coming up with these new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11897)|
| 3:18:23| And business owners are the ones that are going to be affected the most with any new regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11903)|
| 3:18:28| I'm all for regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| But asking you to vote on this is like asking you to vote for a new highway that's coming through town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11910)|
| 3:18:34| but nobody's going to tell you before the vote where that highway's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| You would not do that, and I don't believe you should be voting for something that we don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| I request that you defer this so that we can all have a chance to review the new regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11923)|
| 3:18:48| and hopefully have a workshop where we can have some input on what's going to be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11928)|
| 3:18:54| Thank you, Mr. Rankin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| More discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11940)|
| 3:19:03| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11943)|
| 3:19:06| Hey, what's in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11946)|
| 3:19:10| I mean, I heard the 60-second hold time, no flashing, no this, that or the other, 20 feet, 10 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11950)|
| 3:19:16| What's in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| Oh, let me review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| And keep in mind that these proposed regulations have been out of MPC since December of 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11960)|
| 3:19:28| and on your agenda virtually every month since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11968)|
| 3:19:32| That December 2011 MPC meeting followed a workshop by a county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11972)|
| 3:19:39| at which time we were instructed to provide a recommendation for you in which you could adopt EMC regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11979)|
| 3:19:50| just like the city has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| So that's what we have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11993)|
| 3:19:55| It establishes a definition for electronic message centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=11995)|
| 3:20:00| and establishes standards for new EMCs and for the operating characteristics of existing EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12000)|
| 3:20:15| So the first one is that if you put up an EMC, you have to take down any hand-changeable reader boards that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12015)|
| 3:20:26| that the EMC is part of the total sign package allowed on the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12026)|
| 3:20:32| that it's permitted either as a wall sign or integrated into a freestanding business sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12032)|
| 3:20:39| such as a monument sign or a ground sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12039)|
| 3:20:45| that it establishes a minimum EMC matrix area, they refer to it, of 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12045)|
| 3:20:52| So you have to have at least 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| And if you are a part of a monument or ground sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12055)|
| 3:20:58| it can be no more than a third of the total sign area up to 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12058)|
| 3:21:04| So to get to 100 square feet of EMC on a detached sign, you would have to have 300 square feet of sign area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12064)|
| 3:21:11| On a wall sign, you can't have up to 100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12071)|
| 3:21:16| It establishes a minimum static hold time of 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12076)|
| 3:21:23| It establishes brightness and glare standards measured in nits, foot candles, and watts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12083)|
| 3:21:34| It establishes definitions for those terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12094)|
| 3:21:38| It establishes that the display must be static| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12098)|
| 3:21:43| and that the images must be complete in themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12103)|
| 3:21:47| so that there is no message that goes from screen to screen to screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12107)|
| 3:21:52| It establishes that the transition from one display to the next has to be instantaneous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12112)|
| 3:22:01| without any special effects, no starbursts, no scrolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| It establishes a minimum text size for all of the text on the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12126)|
| 3:22:12| based on the speed limit of the road upon which the sign is oriented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12132)|
| 3:22:18| from a minimum of 7 inches for the lowest speeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12138)|
| 3:22:23| and up to 15 inches for a minimum size for the high-speed roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12143)|
| 3:22:28| And then for EMCs that were established before you adopt these new regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12148)|
| 3:22:34| it makes applicable the operating characteristics, the static hold time, the brightness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12154)|
| 3:22:43| the instant message change, and the no continuation of messages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12163)|
| 3:22:51| And then there is a provision for EMCs as a changeable price sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12171)|
| 3:22:56| such as the gas prices and motel prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| Those are allowed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12180)|
| 3:23:02| So those are the new standards that would come into play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| as a result of adopting these regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12185)|
| 3:23:08| When the city did theirs, there's one right down the road here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12188)|
| 3:23:13| about two or three blocks, that looks like Times Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| How was that able to pass the city ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12196)|
| 3:23:20| That was subject to a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12200)|
| 3:23:25| And the city ordinance allows EMCs that are within the downtown design overlay district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12205)|
| 3:23:39| and within any historic district or within any other district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12219)|
| 3:23:46| whereby plan approval is required to establish standards during that plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12226)|
| 3:23:55| So, for example, on the Tennessee Theater has moving lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12235)|
| 3:24:01| That's within the downtown design overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12241)|
| 3:24:06| The Convention Center has a minimum hold time that's considerably less than 60 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12246)|
| 3:24:12| That's within the downtown design overlay district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12252)|
| 3:24:15| And the plan approval through those provisions has established those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12255)|
| 3:24:21| Have we had a number of accidents around the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12261)|
| 3:24:25| and in front of the Tennessee Theater and in front of the place down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12265)|
| 3:24:29| because of those flashing lights and the brightness and all of those kinds of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12269)|
| 3:24:33| I am not aware of any data that would say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12273)|
| 3:24:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12282)|
| 3:24:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12285)|
| 3:24:46| I guess my question to MPC is, so far, I heard the gentleman say he didn't really have a lot of discussion time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12286)|
| 3:24:58| How much, how well vetted was the city's process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12298)|
| 3:25:02| Because if we, quote, unquote, adopted the city process, I think the vendors are probably similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12302)|
| 3:25:08| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12308)|
| 3:25:09| And I don't know the answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12309)|
| 3:25:10| How well hashed out was the city's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12310)|
| 3:25:16| We're in the 15th month since MPC's recommendation for this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12316)|
| 3:25:23| and it was probably almost that long with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12323)|
| 3:25:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12326)|
| 3:25:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12342)|
| 3:25:44| So what was the, were both sides represented or at least invited to present their cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12344)|
| 3:25:54| Yes, there were several workshops with city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12354)|
| 3:25:58| MPC had public meetings prior to making their recommendation, and you have had several workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12358)|
| 3:26:09| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12369)|
| 3:26:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12370)|
| 3:26:12| Mr. Roenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12372)|
| 3:26:20| I would like to make a substitute motion that we, I don't think 60 more days or to the June meeting is going to change probably any outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12380)|
| 3:26:31| but I think that waiting 60 more days, we've done that in November and waited until February to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12391)|
| 3:26:38| and then we postponed it until March to vote on the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12398)|
| 3:26:42| I think waiting two more months and deferring this until June meeting I think would be appropriate for us to look into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12402)|
| 3:26:52| and overlook because there's 13 actually regulations on here with subparts to all 13 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12412)|
| 3:27:04| It's quite a lot to look over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12424)|
| 3:27:08| and I'd like to find out a little bit more about brightness and 3,000 nits and 750 nits and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12428)|
| 3:27:23| I know it's just I think I'd like to find out a little bit more about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12443)|
| 3:27:27| so I think deferring it and I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer this until the June meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12447)|
| 3:27:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12453)|
| 3:27:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12456)|
| 3:27:37| Discussion for the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12457)|
| 3:27:39| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12459)|
| 3:27:40| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12460)|
| 3:27:41| You know, I have a point of clarification is that our workshop, we removed the word ban from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12461)|
| 3:27:51| and what effect by removing that word does it have on this regulation since or this ordinance since that hasn't passed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12471)|
| 3:27:57| Is the ban off the table now or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12477)|
| 3:28:00| At the workshop, you made a recommendation to remove, to go with the regulation rather than the ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12480)|
| 3:28:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12487)|
| 3:28:08| If you deferred this item, they'd both come back to you again at the workshop in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12488)|
| 3:28:14| and then again at the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12494)|
| 3:28:19| Jim, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12499)|
| 3:28:24| So the consideration to ban would be on the table again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12504)|
| 3:28:30| Well, no, that's what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12510)|
| 3:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12512)|
| 3:28:33| And it would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12513)|
| 3:28:34| Because we, you know, I guess what I'm trying to do is that I don't, I may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12514)|
| 3:28:41| but I don't think that there's a consensus on this body to ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12521)|
| 3:28:46| We can leave it on there and vote on it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12526)|
| 3:28:49| Maybe we ought to discuss that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| Do we want to put that back in there or do we want to take that off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12531)|
| 3:28:55| Because that may change what ultimately happens with this regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12535)|
| 3:29:05| Mr. Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12545)|
| 3:29:06| I guess clarification, if we're deferring what is before us, which is not the ban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12546)|
| 3:29:13| we're not changing anything as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| I'm not saying that these regulations will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12555)|
| 3:29:18| I just want to research them a little bit more, find out what nits mean and, you know, 3,000 nits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12558)|
| 3:29:25| I don't know what that, how bright that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12565)|
| 3:29:28| It's just something I want to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12568)|
| 3:29:30| If we're not, I guess I need clarification because if we're not changing anything yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12570)|
| 3:29:36| it wouldn't technically be putting the ban back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12576)|
| 3:29:39| It's just deferring what's in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12581)|
| 3:29:44| Well, both matters are before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12584)|
| 3:29:47| At the workshop, you made a recommendation to move forward and pass the regulation on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12587)|
| 3:29:56| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12596)|
| 3:29:57| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12597)|
| 3:29:58| Can I make a clarification to see if it would be okay to the people that made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12598)|
| 3:30:04| What I would like to do, because this is what we recommended at the workshop two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12604)|
| 3:30:12| is to remove the word ban and it will be a concession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12612)|
| 3:30:17| So if we start that process, I believe then they could start issuing permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12617)|
| 3:30:23| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12623)|
| 3:30:24| Or does it take the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12624)|
| 3:30:27| But just, this is part of the process that we're going to have here is that this is a first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12627)|
| 3:30:36| because this is an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12636)|
| 3:30:37| And what it means is that for it to pass, we have to have a first reading and then a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12637)|
| 3:30:43| And that's going to take at least two months to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| We could go ahead and what I would add on, what I would leave on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12647)|
| 3:30:51| because right now the word ban has been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12651)|
| 3:30:55| And if we vote on this today to pass it, if we vote on it to pass it, banning is off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12655)|
| 3:31:04| But that would give us a month or two months, if we wanted to, to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12664)|
| 3:31:11| and then discuss whether or what we want to do with the regulating part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12671)|
| 3:31:17| It would come back up to where we can, it's what Commissioner Owenby had talked about on what are NITs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12677)|
| 3:31:23| or, you know, what's the sizing, what's the impact of the hold time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12683)|
| 3:31:28| what's the impact on the size of the sign on the hold time, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12688)|
| 3:31:32| But then it would still mean that we, if there were things that people had objections to that could not be resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12692)|
| 3:31:40| then it could be defeated at the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12700)|
| 3:31:43| But what it would do, it would get banning off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12703)|
| 3:31:48| And that's something that I think is necessary if it's going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12708)|
| 3:31:54| And what that would require is us for going ahead and voting on this today is to pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12714)|
| 3:32:01| We have time to sort these things out, and then we can decide on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12721)|
| 3:32:07| Now, it would, if things are dropped, it would be a, I mean, it does delay things some if there are changes made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12727)|
| 3:32:13| or if it's defeated, or if it passes the second time without changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12733)|
| 3:32:17| But it, you know, but at least we have the part banning off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12737)|
| 3:32:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12743)|
| 3:32:24| I didn't do that very, I wasn't very articulate with what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12744)|
| 3:32:27| But do you all understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12747)|
| 3:32:30| I'll withdraw my substantive motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12750)|
| 3:32:32| And then we can vote on this to regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12752)|
| 3:32:35| But, see, then we have a couple of months before it would pass on second reading to do the things that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12755)|
| 3:32:41| But we've got ban off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12761)|
| 3:32:44| Because I don't think, I don't think that we, I may be wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12764)|
| 3:32:47| but I don't think we have the will on the commission right now to pass a complete ban on these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12767)|
| 3:32:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12773)|
| 3:32:54| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12774)|
| 3:32:58| Are you the second, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12778)|
| 3:33:00| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12780)|
| 3:33:01| I would like to say, too, that, you know, if we go ahead with the first reading at our work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12781)|
| 3:33:06| perhaps we could carve out some time to have any of the business community that wanted to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12786)|
| 3:33:11| and address us at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| That would be a time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12793)|
| 3:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12795)|
| 3:33:16| Joe, will you make that happen, okay, in our agenda for the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12796)|
| 3:33:20| Let me make a statement, really, to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12800)|
| 3:33:23| What this does, this gets the first part of it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12803)|
| 3:33:26| It doesn't make it final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12806)|
| 3:33:28| But what it does, it allows us to open it, you know, to open it up to more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12808)|
| 3:33:33| But it gets the ban off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12813)|
| 3:33:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12818)|
| 3:33:41| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12821)|
| 3:33:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12822)|
| 3:33:43| And the second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| The second did agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12825)|
| 3:33:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| Go ahead, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| Is the term incandescent light a legal word?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12831)|
| 3:34:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12841)|
| 3:34:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12850)|
| 3:34:11| Do we have anything else, Mr. Irwin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12855)|
| 3:34:16| We're back to any other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12856)|
| 3:34:18| We're back to the original motion to approve on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12858)|
| 3:34:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12862)|
| 3:34:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12864)|
| 3:34:25| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12865)|
| 3:34:26| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12866)|
| 3:34:27| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12867)|
| 3:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12876)|
| 3:34:37| Is there any further business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| Do we have anything else you guys want to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| Seeing no further business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130429?start=12883)|
