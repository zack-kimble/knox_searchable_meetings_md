| 2:16:20| So are we going to get that 19.4 million up front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8180)|
| 2:16:23| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8183)|
| 2:16:24| that's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8184)|
| 2:16:25| we will get it up front by borrowing against the $30 million income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8185)|
| 2:16:27| stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8187)|

| 2:16:29| is the quick answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| The longer answer is yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8190)|
| 2:16:31| We're getting it up front because we're borrowing against a $30 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| income stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8194)|
| 2:16:35| Cause we need that money to help pay for the construction costs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8198)|
| 2:16:39| If we wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8199)|
| 2:16:40| we could just wait and get a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8200)|
| 2:16:42| $30 million a year and then apply it for a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8202)|
| 2:16:44| But that way we wouldn't have the money up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8204)|
| 2:16:46| And right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| interest rates are so incredibly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8207)|
| 2:16:49| It would be like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8209)|
| 2:16:50| even the taxable debt is under 3% right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8210)|

| 2:16:56| it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| it's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| we don't know for sure if this will hang in there with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8218)|
| 2:17:00| but the number of runs that I saw had the debt to borrow that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| thing at about 2.75 to 2.8%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| which is a really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| really low interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| And there's just so much demand for high quality debt like this that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8230)|

| 2:17:14| it just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8234)|
| 2:17:15| it would make sense to borrow the money up front instead of advancing city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8235)|
| 2:17:19| or county monies and then getting it back over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8239)|
| 2:17:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8241)|

| 2:19:00| the 270 jobs would be new jobs that are full-time equivalent jobs that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8340)|

| 2:19:23| the construction and the operations of this ballpark will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8363)|

| 2:24:20| Well, you referenced that on page 32, the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8660)|
| 2:24:24| But anyways, the second one, Toyota Field, in 2020| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| was $46 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| And that's a total capacity of 7,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8670)|
| 2:24:35| It's closer to what our projected stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| And that's why I guess I was wondering, this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8680)|
| 2:24:42| was finished in 2021 at $75 million with 10,000 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8682)|
| 2:24:48| And we're almost at the same price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8692)|
| 2:24:53| I personally would not be able to comment on the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8693)|
| 2:24:56| costs that are estimated for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8696)|
| 2:24:58| I was not part of the estimating team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8698)|
| 2:25:00| for this particular project in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| We just took the project costs at face value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8705)|
| 2:25:08| and inputted them in our economic impact model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| So I don't think I'm the right person to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| Perhaps, Chris, Mr. Caldwell, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8713)|
| 2:25:16| could just follow up with us on doing a comparison of price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8721)|
| 2:25:22| Obviously, every price increase has gone up in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8722)|
| 2:25:26| But in general, I think the goal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| to try to get a price per square foot comparison, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8728)|
| 2:25:31| We can follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8731)|
| 2:25:32| I think, ultimately, it could be where it's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8732)|
| 2:25:34| I mean, that's what we have found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| that stadiums that are built in cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| are more expensive than if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| on a greenfield, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8741)|
| 2:25:44| OK, well, and again, because we've only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8744)|
| 2:25:46| had this just for a few minutes, that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8746)|
| 2:25:48| could be incorporated somewhere else in this 51 page report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8748)|
| 2:25:51| So I just happened to notice that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8751)|
| 2:25:53| and I was just curious on the $75 million for 10,000 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8753)|
| 2:25:57| I would just add, it's a great question, and I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| The Toyota Field was built like in Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| It was built off an interstate exit in a greenfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8763)|
| 2:26:06| And so it has a substantially lower development cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| And they did $20 or $30 million of interstate improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8770)|
| 2:26:13| that they paid for with a TIF on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| So it doesn't really reflect the total overall project costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| And it would be like, again, if we went out to Strawberry Plains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8779)|
| 2:26:24| and built it out there sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| And so it's not, obviously, as a brownfield site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8786)|
| 2:26:31| that we're dealing with here, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8791)|
| 2:26:32| going to be significantly higher construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| And also, that deal, they signed their construction contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8794)|
| 2:26:39| like two years before the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| And so they were quite fortunate when they hit the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| But your question is a great one, and we need to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| We've been trying to understand that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8807)|
| 2:26:49| But I think the Toyota Field is largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| because of the nature of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| Mr. Smith, Citi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8814)|
| 2:26:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| I want to clarify a conversation earlier about public access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8819)|
| 2:27:02| to non-paid events, how many days the public would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8822)|
| 2:27:06| have access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8826)|
| 2:27:07| There was conversation about parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| afternoons, evenings, when there's nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| I may have misspoke, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| It'll be open like a park during the daytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8837)|
| 2:27:21| I was trying to respond, I think it was to Commissioner Daly's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8841)|
| 2:27:24| question about big civic events, like when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8844)|
| 2:27:27| we have the right to have a Memorial Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| celebration or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| I heard 10 days and was a little concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| But specific to that, what contract or agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| will those terms be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8858)|
| 2:27:40| That'll be in the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8860)|
| 2:27:41| In the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8861)|
| 2:27:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8862)|
| 2:27:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8863)|
| 2:27:44| I'm going to take the liberty of having the last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8864)|
| 2:27:47| before we move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8867)|
| 2:27:48| What order will the agreements be presented and voted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| Will it first originate in the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| and then come to the city and then the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| or come to the county, city, sports authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8878)|
| 2:28:00| Or how will the order go this fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8880)|
| 2:28:06| That's a wonderful question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8886)|
| 2:28:07| I'd like to tell you that we have thought carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8887)|
| 2:28:10| through that, but we really have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8890)|
| 2:28:13| I'm guessing it would start with the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8893)|
| 2:28:15| because that's the governing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8895)|
| 2:28:16| I think it would start with the sports authority, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8896)|
| 2:28:17| as the governing thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8897)|
| 2:28:18| But if you all disapprove it or say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8898)|
| 2:28:21| you need to make these sort of tweaks to garner our approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8901)|
| 2:28:24| then we'd have to go back to the sports authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8904)|
| 2:28:27| As soon as you know if the chicken or the egg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8907)|
| 2:28:29| might come first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8909)|
| 2:28:30| I think, honestly, we'd love to have your all's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| What would you like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8912)|
| 2:28:33| And I think several of you asked me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8913)|
| 2:28:34| will we have additional workshops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8914)|
| 2:28:35| I can't imagine that you all won't want something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8915)|
| 2:28:38| like this, where we go through the details of the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8918)|
| 2:28:41| at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8921)|
| 2:28:42| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8923)|
| 2:28:43| We'll hold that for a side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| I'm going to jump right into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8925)|

| 2:28:56| Driscilla, if you would put a timer up for three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=8936)|

| 2:43:40| that area for a long time, we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=9820)|

| 2:44:20| of more residents moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=9860)|

| 2:44:29| especially with more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210819-co-com-joint-ws?start=9869)|
