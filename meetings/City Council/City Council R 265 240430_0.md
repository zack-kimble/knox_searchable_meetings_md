| 0:09:27| delivery services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=567)|

| 0:09:46| Okay, do I introduce myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=586)|
| 0:09:57| Sorry, can you go over the procedure again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=597)|
| 0:10:00| You have to state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Hi, my name is Fatima El-Hassan, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| Today I stand before you to discuss the proposed ordinance to prohibit the use of personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| delivery devices, or PDDs, on our city streets, sidewalks, and right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=617)|
| 0:10:25| This is a matter not just of urban planning or technological advancement, but of safeguarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=625)|
| 0:10:30| the fabric of our community and the livelihoods of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| First and foremost, we must consider the impact of these autonomous robots on our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| PDDs, by design, replace human jobs, jobs that are currently held by hard-working delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| drivers, many of whom are our neighbors, friends, and family members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| These are individuals who rely on these jobs for their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| Adopting such technology risks putting these hard-working individuals out of work, increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| unemployment, and destabilizing families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| We must question the advancement of a technology that potentially harms those who contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| daily to our economy and community well-being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| Furthermore, it's crucial to consider the accessibility and the safety of our sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=678)|
| 0:11:27| Sidewalks are a public good meant for the safe passage of people, particularly those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| among us who are handicapped or have mobility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| Our city sidewalks should not become testing grounds for robots that navigate through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| pedestrian areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| During our six-month moratorium, studies conducted by city staff in collaboration with the Mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| Council on Disability Issues have shown that our current infrastructure is not suited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| accommodate these devices without risking the safety and convenience of pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| especially those with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| Introducing PDDs to these environments could obstruct their path, complicate their daily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| commutes, and diminish their quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| It's important to recognize that while technology can bring convenience, it should not do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| at the expense of accessibility and community welfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| The charm of Knoxville lies in its community-focused approach, ensuring that every resident feels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| safe, valued, and heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| By allowing PDDs on our sidewalks, we risk compromising these values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=753)|
| 0:12:39| In conclusion, while the advancement of technology often brings many benefits, it is our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=759)|
| 0:12:46| as stewards of this city to ensure that such benefits do not undermine the essentials of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| community life and employment stability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Thus, I urge all our members of the Council to support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| Let us prioritize human jobs, safeguard pedestrian right-of-ways for all our citizens, and introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=780)|
| 0:13:09| and ensure that Knoxville remains a city that values human interaction and community beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| impersonal technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Thank you for your attention and your commitment to the welfare of all Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=797)|
| 0:13:31| Cease fire now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=811)|
| 0:13:36| Please don't disrupt the meeting from the audience and stay germane and on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| Ellis Connelly, you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| You have up to five minutes to address Council on the topic of Item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=827)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you very much, Your Honors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| My name is Ellis Connelly, District 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Ladies and gentlemen of Knoxville City Council, esteemed members of the community, I stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| before you today to advocate for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| That is not only crucial for the safety and well-being of our citizens, but also for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| preservation of our city's pedestrian-friendly environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| The proposal to amend Chapter 16 of the Knoxville City Code to prohibit personal delivery devices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| henceforth referred to as PDDs, on city streets, sidewalks, and right-of-ways is a necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| step towards ensuring the harmonious coexistence of emerging technologies with our urban landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=879)|
| 0:14:46| First, let us acknowledge the undeniable convenience that PDDs bring to modern living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=886)|
| 0:14:55| They offer a novel and efficient means of delivering goods and services to our doorsteps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| streamlining everyday tasks and reducing reliance on traditional transportation methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=902)|
| 0:15:08| However, with innovation, too, comes responsibility, and it is imperative that we regulate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| deployment of these devices to maintain the safety and accessibility of our public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| One of the key reasons for supporting this ordinance is the need to confine PDDs to areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=922)|
| 0:15:28| where pedestrian traffic is predominant, such as University of Tennessee's campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=928)|
| 0:15:34| By limiting their operation to walkable zones, we can mitigate the risk of collisions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| ensure that pedestrians, including students, faculty, and residents at our university,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| can navigate our streets and sidewalks without fear of interference or harm further from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| our city's automobile goers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| Furthermore, this ordinance aligns with our commitment to prioritizing non-motorized modes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=953)|
| 0:16:00| of transportation and fostering a pedestrian-friendly cityscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| Knoxville prides itself on vibrant neighborhoods and bustling downtown, where foot traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| fuels economic activity and community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=970)|
| 0:16:15| Allowing PDDs free reign on our streets would not only jeopardize the safety of pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=975)|
| 0:16:21| but also undermine our efforts to create inclusive and accessible public spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=981)|
| 0:16:27| However, I must emphasize my reluctance to cede more of our precious right-of-ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| car traffic, even though this is a boon to pedestrians overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| As a city, we haven't done enough to promote alternative modes of transportation, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| when it comes to expanding bike lanes and enhancing public transit options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| I agree that allowing PDDs to roam freely alongside pedestrians would only exacerbate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| congestion and diminish quality of life for our residents, as pedestrians would not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1011)|
| 0:16:56| have to look out for vehicle traffic on crosswalks, but also watch their step to avoid these PDDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1016)|
| 0:17:01| while already attempting to crosswalk on limited space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1021)|
| 0:17:06| I do not support this ordinance because I support the prioritization of automobile traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| Quite the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| I support this ordinance as a way to ensure that pedestrians don't have yet one more thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1033)|
| 0:17:19| to worry about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| In conclusion, I urge you to support the proposed ordinance to prohibit personal delivery devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| – PDDs – on city streets, sidewalks, and right-of-ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| By doing so, we reaffirm our commitment to safeguarding the well-being of our citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| preserving the vitality of our pedestrian-centric neighborhoods, and advancing our vision of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| a sustainable and livable Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Thank you for your time, attention, and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1070)|

| 0:18:03| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1083)|
| 0:18:05| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| This is the final person who signed up for item 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1087)|
| 0:18:11| Ms. Zhang, you may state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| Good evening, Mayor, Vice Mayor, and City Council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| Thank you for allowing me the time to speak here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1100)|
| 0:18:23| My name is Eileen Zhang, and I am the U.S. Director of Government Affairs for Starship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1103)|
| 0:18:30| I'm here in opposition of this ordinance that bans personal delivery devices, or PDDs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1110)|

| 0:19:58| The service is convenient for students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| But not only that, it's more environmentally friendly and safer than traditional methods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1202)|

| 0:20:25| And they are geofenced and confined to that operational area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| So we make sure that where we operate, the sidewalks are wide enough for operations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| that they can traverse safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| And if that's not the case, we flag that to the city and the University that certain areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| are not operable and work with the city to help alleviate those specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| Additionally, I wanted to flag that they always return to their parking space after deliveries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1251)|

| 0:21:00| The PDDs offer a safe and more environmentally friendly approach, as PDDs are not subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1260)|
| 0:21:07| to the same risks as traditional deliveries, such as distracted driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| And PDD operations also align with the City of Knoxville's Vision Zero Action Plan goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| of creating safer community for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1278)|

| 0:21:26| and goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| We urge the Council to vote no on this ordinance and instead seek an alternative path to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| PDDs to operate safely through some form of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1293)|

| 0:21:49| with staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| For example, in the City of Chicago, we operate around a university and it goes through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| permitting procedure where we get the operational area approved and we also pay for a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| for operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| If this ordinance passes, we will not be able to expand to access students living off campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1328)|
| 0:22:16| which I was told is going to be about 2,200 beds that we will not be able to access because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1336)|
| 0:22:24| it is across the city right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| With that, again, I urge your no vote on this ordinance so that we can work together and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| find a solution that works for the city and its businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1352)|

| 0:22:57| Thank you for sending your letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| I don't think I'll be supporting what you're asking, but I did want to ask you, it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| like the majority of your business is on college campuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| And so I didn't see a lot of activity outside of campus areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| I'm sorry, you said you see a lot of activity outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Oh, in other cities, I only see it on college campuses, I think, which you're asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| us to consider outside of college campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| So we are opposed to an outright ban from the city, but what we are supportive of is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1403)|
| 0:23:30| more of a middle approach where the city can approve certain areas for operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| So we do operate outside of universities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| We want to be able to access the dorms that are across the street from Cumberland, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| example, where dorms are not accessible currently because it's on the city right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1426)|
| 0:23:53| So the only way we can cross it now is through a pedestrian bridge that we have been in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1433)|
| 0:24:01| with the city for operations, for operations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1446)|

| 0:24:22| I was wondering what are some of the barriers that the city sees to allowing this, allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1462)|
| 0:24:35| their operations to expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| What are the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I think the main concern is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| Safety is always the main concern, and the fact that people might fall or trip or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| have ability to pass by if they're in a wheelchair or other mobility device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| That's the main concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| That seems a bit broad since they're already in operation, and the area that they are talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1498)|
| 0:25:06| about moving into, they are able to access right now with a pedestrian bridge with pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1506)|
| 0:25:12| on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I've seen them on that other side of Cumberland Avenue before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| It seems a bit arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| This wouldn't shrink their ability to operate where they're already operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| They can continue to operate there, and over time if safety patterns look good, but I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1526)|
| 0:25:33| the university population in and around the university is a little different from other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1533)|
| 0:25:40| parts of the city as far as mobility issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| Sure, and what I'm hearing them ask for is simply consideration that they can expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| their operations around the university campus, not into downtown Knoxville, not into our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| That seems like a really reasonable conversation to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Was that a conversation that the city even considered having with the vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| Yes, there were conversations, and this doesn't close the door forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1570)|
| 0:26:14| It just means that the city, we think that there needs to be more time to ensure safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| issues are considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| Expanding this form of delivery is not the highest priority and didn't seem to be connected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1582)|
| 0:26:31| to opportunities and convenience or any of the other things that were among our highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| I think safety is the first consideration if in the future the entities like this that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1598)|
| 0:26:46| want to do that want to show that they can come back at any time, but this is what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1606)|
| 0:26:54| thinking is the best path forward for the time being for 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| Under this current strategy, city council would have to pass an ordinance to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1619)|
| 0:27:12| operations in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1632)|
| 0:27:17| That seems like a different path forward than simply expanding a moratorium until more conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1637)|
| 0:27:28| can be had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| When I first reviewed this at our last meeting, I imagined this technology coming into downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| Knoxville, and I immediately thought, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| The sidewalks aren't big enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| This is going to impede the mobility of others, pedestrians, people with disabilities, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1662)|
| 0:27:49| then I was able to talk to the company and have a better understanding of what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1669)|
| 0:27:56| considerations were, and it fits in with the other concerns that we have around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| university campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| We have a growing campus community regardless of what we have to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| They continue to grow the student population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Student housing continues to grow around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| As a city, as a campus community, we have to think about congestion and how to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| the congestion that might be anticipated with a growing campus in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1701)|
| 0:28:31| After speaking with the company and hearing their concerns about an all-out ban, it seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| reasonable to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| It seemed like a more reasonable step forward would be to extend the moratorium, which I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| guess has expired at this point, to allow more time for discussions to see as UT moves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1724)|
| 0:28:52| forward with plans to expand, does it make sense for this service, which really is integrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1732)|

| 0:29:20| Ms. Ball, can you explain a little bit more about what this will do and what it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1760)|

| 0:29:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| Our team met with the local staff specifically, in particular with UT Dining as well as Starship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1771)|
| 0:29:47| local staff, and at this juncture they don't have any immediate plans for expansion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| they can't reach by staying on University of Tennessee property versus city right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1792)|
| 0:30:02| That was related to this particular situation that is current on UT campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| Because they're operating on campus property and UT right-of-way, the city does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| any direct jurisdiction to keep them from doing that, so they'll be able to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| We were starting to get requests for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| We were starting to get requests to expand from other companies this type of delivery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1824)|
| 0:30:31| service into other areas, and that's what prompted us to come to you to put a six-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| moratorium on this particular type of device on our city right-of-way so that we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1837)|
| 0:30:44| do more research on how other cities are handling this, not just on campuses but in other parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| of their city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| So our decision based on that information is that at this juncture it really is best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1853)|
| 0:31:02| for us to put this in place so that we don't, our choices are permitting, providing a permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1862)|
| 0:31:11| process which becomes very challenging, and we're definitely not prepared at this immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1871)|
| 0:31:19| juncture to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| But other cities have put this in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| They've also retracted it several months after implementing it, and so at this juncture we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1883)|
| 0:31:29| do not feel like this is the best option for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| Councilmember Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1895)|

| 0:31:40| I'm going to support this agenda item because in the absence of a ban, any other company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1900)|
| 0:31:47| could come in here and do it with or without the city's permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| If somebody else wants to do this, coming back before council and creating an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| that is enforceable about how these things are done I think is the correct action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| We've been down this road before with other opportunities that just land in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1925)|
| 0:32:11| so I support a ban until we decide it's good, until if and when we decide we want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1931)|
| 0:32:22| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| I turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Ms. Ball, if this company or any other company sat down with you and delineated areas that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| were mutually agreeable, we could modify and include other areas as needed or as reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1953)|
| 0:32:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| With a modification to the ordinance, we could, if reviewed and if mutually agreeable, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1966)|
| 0:32:54| are points in the future where we can modify and expand if there are a demand and reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| sidewalk access to do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| Ms. Song, this is a request to do commercial delivery on public sidewalks and having been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| in a situation with a friend who was a cancer patient limited to a wheelchair and having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=1994)|
| 0:33:22| other commercial activity like this on sidewalks, it made it very difficult without regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2002)|
| 0:33:31| and allowing these types of things on sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| We really just never fund enough and never do enough for our people with mobility issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| who really need sidewalks, and I'm sorry that's my priority and why I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| And when we were limiting and doing moratoriums for mobility devices for the scooter type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| of things, that was also a big concern because I watched my friend not be able to make forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| progress because of all these new technologies, and I don't mean to sound like an old fogey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| but we have people in wheelchairs and with mobility issues that need to get down our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| sidewalks and they need to be our number one versus a commercial access to food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2046)|
| 0:34:14| So until the staff finds a good reason to support a policy change that will accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2054)|
| 0:34:23| and still include those people with mobility issues as our number one concern, then I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| going to support this ordinance change that we have before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Mayor, do you mind if I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| No one's asked you anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2076)|

| 0:35:00| We do not operate in areas where accessibility would be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| We flagged that for the city as somewhere that we would like to cooperate and work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| to ensure that sidewalks and crosswalks are made accessible to everyone in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2111)|

| 0:35:36| helps and saves them from being able to get food access to wherever they need food from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2136)|
| 0:35:46| instead of having to drive or other forms of modes of transportation to get their food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2146)|
| 0:35:54| I just wanted to share that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=2154)|

| 1:01:36| Furthermore, the need for road resurfacing extends beyond just ensuring the safety of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3696)|
| 1:01:42| our drivers and cyclists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| It also has significant implications for the economic vitality of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| Smooth, well-maintained roads are essential for facilitating movement of goods and people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3710)|

| 1:02:56| both in terms of financial expenses and human costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Additionally, the resolution aligns with our broader goals of promoting sustainability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3781)|

| 1:04:25| But I don't support stifling the public's voice and making a game out of it every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3865)|
| 1:04:36| I've been in this room under previous administrations protesting, and I just didn't see them jump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3876)|
| 1:04:44| for that gavel as quickly as our current mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| It really disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| Also it frustrates me as a councilperson because I know, as a community organizer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| that the only response is to double down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| When your rights are being threatened, when you don't feel like you have free speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3905)|

| 1:05:17| To test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3917)|

| 1:05:20| And who's going to sit here through all of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3922)|

| 1:05:33| I don't appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| I don't think it's good governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3934)|

| 1:06:07| It's so important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| So I know y'all are frustrated, and you don't want to sit through a protest, you don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3968)|
| 1:06:14| to have to acknowledge that people are trying to carry out a protest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3974)|
| 1:06:18| But it's their right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| And they're doing it within our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| So let's allow them to speak within our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| Let's not be, you know, trying to find little nitpicky ways for young people, who I'm so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=3987)|

| 1:13:39| principle that no loss of life or injury is acceptable on our roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4419)|

| 1:22:16| Are there any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Yes, I have a question for Director Clabo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| It appears that this funding would be applied to some studies to make Knoxville more pedestrian-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4942)|
| 1:22:31| citywide, but it also looks like we're past the planning stage, perhaps on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4951)|
| 1:22:37| Could you talk a little bit about what would be implemented with this funding between Blount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| Avenue and Front Lane on Chapman Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| Sure, I'd be glad to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| I'm Tom Clabo, Engineering Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| There are two components to the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4970)|
| 1:22:55| One of those is an implementation project, which would be Chapman Highway in that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4975)|
| 1:23:01| TDOT did a concept plan of the entire corridor of Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4981)|
| 1:23:08| There were seven different segments they identified, and that was segment one in their study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| It had the highest crash rate, and so we wanted to focus on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4993)|
| 1:23:17| So we are working with TDOT now to kind of finalize some costs to see exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=4997)|
| 1:23:23| I'm not sure the limits will be all the way to Feronda, but it will be part of that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| But that would be a project that we would design and implement if we got the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| There's also some supplemental planning studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| We're looking at safe routes to school plan, looking at street lighting with an emphasis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5016)|
| 1:23:44| towards pedestrian safety, and also looking at safety audits on those streets that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5024)|
| 1:23:52| identified on the high-injury network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| So that would be looking for opportunities for smaller projects to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5035)|
| 1:24:01| So that's the two components of the grant application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5041)|
| 1:24:05| Okay, and looking at the numbers, this looks like the 80%, 20% split between the federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5045)|
| 1:24:12| government and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5055)|
| 1:24:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Mr. Clabo, you mentioned the safe routes to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Can you expand upon that a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| What we would do is part of the grant funding, and we're thinking somewhere around a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| dollars for all of those supplemental planning grants, we would work with the health department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| and our local partners to try to strengthen our area in safe routes to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| And it's really looking at sidewalks and those parental responsibility zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5083)|
| 1:24:44| I had a conversation with a parent along Yonge High Pike who struggles with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| They're half a mile from the school, and so there's no shoulders on the road that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| is to walk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| And so we're going to ride the bus together and walk to school next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| But most people don't, if you don't have kids or kids that are in school that you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5098)|
| 1:25:02| take to school, many people don't know that there's that gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| So I'm excited about that component of it, as is, of course, the Chapman Highway stretch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5105)|

| 1:26:24| There's not much information on this company as to where it's located other than just I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5184)|
| 1:26:35| come up with and I'm kind of laid back when it comes to doing Google searches, find pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5195)|
| 1:26:44| of their board of directors and also their top officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5204)|
| 1:26:54| What I'd like to know would be where this company is located, what country is it chartered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5214)|
| 1:27:03| in originally, how many other companies were solicited and asked to bid on these services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5223)|
| 1:27:17| And depending on the answers, I'd like to also know how compliant the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5237)|
| 1:27:29| is with this state, I guess it's a law, I guess the assembly passed it a few years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5249)|
| 1:27:39| about doing business with the state of Israel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| And if you don't, you could be precluded from having commercial or business associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| I would imagine, or you could even be penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| I haven't looked at the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5275)|
| 1:27:56| I haven't read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| I just know, I just remember it coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5277)|
| 1:28:02| And if that's pertinent, connected to the potential answers, if you deem it necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5282)|
| 1:28:12| or if you deem it plausible to answer the question, what that's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5292)|
| 1:28:24| I'll stay right here because it's still my time, but I'd like to hear something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5304)|
| 1:28:37| We don't answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5317)|
| 1:28:38| If council has questions, we'll answer them during the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| Well, since I'm not speaking, can you freeze my time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| If you're done speaking, then you may sit down and I'll call the next person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| No, he's getting ready to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5333)|
| 1:28:57| No, we'll answer questions that council has when they arise during their discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| But not to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| This is democracy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| Okay, next person signed up to speak is Fatima El-Hassan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| Please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| Fatima El-Hassan, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| We stand at a moral crossroads today as we discuss the financial implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| of continuing our relationship with Oracle through third-party support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| It is imperative that we recognize the broader implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| of our association with this corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| Oracle has not only publicly supported actions and policies of the Israeli government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| but has also committed to doubling its investments there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| including a second data center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| These moves come at a time when the international community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| is increasingly concerned about the humanitarian crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| and allegations of human rights violations in Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5404)|
| 1:30:09| Oracle's actions and their vocal support align them and inadvertently us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| with policies widely criticized around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| It is crucial to consider the ethical dimensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| and the long-term reputational implications for our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| for our democracy, for our morals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| This resolution proposes that the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| continue utilizing Oracle's software products through Remedy Streets Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| benefiting from the reduced costs and bypassing the need for competitive bidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| While fiscal prudence is important, we must weigh the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| against the ethical stance we take as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| Knoxville, I know because I'm a native here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| has always strived to be a beacon of justice and integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| Our city has a proud tradition of standing with those who are marginalized and oppressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| How can we, in good conscience, continue to financially support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| and tie ourselves to a corporation that openly supports actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5468)|
| 1:31:12| we as a community might find troubling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| And these actions are genocide, by the way, genocide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| Genocide against indigenous people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5479)|
| 1:31:24| The global community is watching, Mayor India Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| and our decisions reflect our values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5488)|
| 1:31:31| By continuing this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| what message are we sending to our residents and to the world?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| Are we prioritizing fiscal savings over human rights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| Over human lives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Is this the legacy we want to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| We must consider alternative vendors and transition away from Oracle products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5507)|
| 1:31:53| thereby aligning our infrastructure and our civic values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| This is not merely a financial decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| It is a profound moral statement about who we are as a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| who you are, council members, as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| Is this the legacy we want to leave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| We must consider alternative vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5532)|
| 1:32:15| Is there no one else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| And transition away from Oracle products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| thereby aligning our infrastructure and our civic values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| It's not merely a financial decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| Therefore, I urge fellow city council members to vote against this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5548)|
| 1:32:35| not accept an agreement made in blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| Let us seek alternatives that keep Knoxville on the right side of history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| showing that our city does not aim for economic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5563)|
| 1:32:47| does not just aim for economic efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| but also champions the cause of human dignity and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5570)|
| 1:32:55| Thank you for considering this crucial perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| Let us make choices that honor our community's values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5579)|
| 1:33:03| our people's values, the city's values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| and contribute to a just and ethical world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Free Palestine, cease fire now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| Next person signed up to speak on this item is Madison Funk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| You have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed members of the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| today I rise to strongly oppose Resolution 11-D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5605)|
| 1:33:31| which authorizes the mayor to execute a piggyback agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5611)|
| 1:33:35| in support with the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| The city of Knoxville is a city that has a long history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| with which authorizes the mayor to execute a piggyback agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| in support with Romini Street or software support services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5626)|
| 1:33:50| for our on-premise Oracle software products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| While I acknowledge the need for software support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| during transition to cloud-based solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| I believe firmly that entering into an agreement with Romini Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| and Oracle is not the best interest of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| There are several compelling reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| as to why this resolution should be rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| First and foremost, instead of outsourcing support services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5657)|
| 1:34:23| to large corporations like Romini Street, Inc., which support Israel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5663)|
| 1:34:28| Knoxville should consider local support companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| in the procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| Local companies can provide more accessible and dedicated support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5673)|
| 1:34:38| fostering stronger relationships and better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| of our city's specific needs and requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| Furthermore, Knoxville boasts a wealth of engineering talent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| particularly from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| By investing in training and competitively compensating local hires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| we can harness the expertise of our own community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| to handle bespoke software needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| This approach not only ensures more personalized and responsive support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| but also contributes to the growth and prosperity of our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| Moreover, Knoxville's decision to transition to a cloud-based solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5714)|
| 1:35:19| should be based on a thorough evaluation of various factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| including user interface and experience, speed, flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| reliability, longevity, and functionality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5728)|
| 1:35:32| Rushing into a grievance with vendors like Romini Street, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| without proper consideration of these factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| could result in suboptimal outcomes and missed opportunities for improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| Additionally, Oracle, the parent company of the software products in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| has a history of imposing burdensome contracts on its clients,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| leading to budget issues, software problems, delays, and legal difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Knoxville deserves a vendor that offers flexible and trustworthy solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| backed by cutting-edge technology and responsive support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5766)|
| 1:36:12| Moreover, recent statements and actions by Oracle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| regarding its support for Israel raise serious ethical concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| Oracle's explicit support for the government and defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5782)|

| 1:36:45| we risk tactically endorsing and supporting genocide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5805)|

| 1:36:56| In conclusion, I urge each member of this City Council to reject this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5816)|
| 1:37:04| and explore alternative solutions that prioritize local businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5824)|

| 1:37:12| Let us choose a path that upholds the values of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| and ensures the best outcome for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5837)|

| 1:37:22| Cease fire now!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Any questions? Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| Chief Brace, would you like to give an overview of our procurement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| and this Nevada-based company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| Yeah, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| David Brace, the Chief of Staff and the Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| So I think, just to give you a little history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| so the city has had various software systems for a long time, like most entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5862)|
| 1:37:48| They handle things like payroll, our HR functions, our benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5868)|
| 1:37:53| We actually used an organization called PeopleSoft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| PeopleSoft was bought by Oracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Oracle is an American company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| They're large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| They're a multinational company that is a big provider of these types of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5880)|
| 1:38:07| They've actually started to handle most of our revenue systems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| So if you think of accounts payable, grants, our general ledger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| So they're big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| We're transitioning from our on-site servers to a cloud-based product like a lot of entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5895)|
| 1:38:21| During that transition, we need to continue our support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5901)|
| 1:38:25| So this contract actually is with Remini, which is a fierce competitor of Oracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| It actually saves us 50% on what we were paying to the other provider that was an Oracle company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5912)|
| 1:38:38| And so this will get us through that transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| So it's a three-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| We actually piggybacked on a, my understanding is, and Mark Parker is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| we piggybacked on a KUV procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| And so our purchasing department, I'm looking over at our CFO, Boyce Evans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| there are times that we will piggyback on contracts with other governmental or semi-governmental entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| We review that procurement to make sure that they met all of our requirements and those of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5938)|
| 1:39:04| And so, again, this saves us 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| It's a temporary support system with, again, Remini, which is based out of Las Vegas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5946)|
| 1:39:13| is an American-based company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| And so it does save us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| You're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5959)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Vice Mayor, any further questions, council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| Could anyone share where the servers for this cloud-based service will be located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5968)|
| 1:39:38| Mr. Mark Parker, our chief technology officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| could you please come to the podium and share what knowledge you have on that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| You can raise the podium up, the whole podium if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5989)|
| 1:39:59| I'll just bend over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=5999)|
| 1:40:00| It's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6000)|
| 1:40:01| Oracle's cloud-based products are stored in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6007)|
| 1:40:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6009)|
| 1:40:10| That just clears that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6010)|
| 1:40:11| So we would continue to use Oracle cloud-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6011)|
| 1:40:25| or we would move from our on-site servers to Oracle cloud-based servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6025)|
| 1:40:32| and then what is the role of Remini in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| So Oracle basically, the PeopleSoft system that David referred to in the Oracle e-business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6036)|
| 1:40:43| is a on-premise software product, and they have been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| And so Oracle has basically discontinued those products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| and they created a new cloud-based HR payroll financial system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| And so to move to those, we implement their cloud-based product| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6058)|
| 1:41:03| because they're no longer going to be supporting their on-premise products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6063)|
| 1:41:11| Maybe I missed it, but Oracle is no longer going to be supporting their on-premises products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6071)|
| 1:41:20| They are going to, they are sunsetting those products so you can no longer stay on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6080)|
| 1:41:24| after a certain period of time several years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6084)|
| 1:41:28| They do provide support for those products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| but this company provides support at a lesser cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| And in order to get the Oracle support for these products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| you have to keep upgrading them and getting on the newest versions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| and that's a cost and expense to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| And since we're going to their cloud-based products, which are their newer technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| we don't want to undergo those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| Okay. So Remini provides the support for Oracle products?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| Yes, for the existing products. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| Okay. Gotcha. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6119)|
| 1:42:01| I had an earlier conversation with Director Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6121)|
| 1:42:04| and was able to get some clarification around these technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| and I do appreciate it because I'm, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| very interested in knowing when we're acquiring new technology how it will be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6134)|
| 1:42:20| and how data will be stored and protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| So I appreciate you clearing up that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| I do still have a few questions moving to this cloud-based system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6148)|
| 1:42:34| so I'm going to abstain on this vote, but I appreciate your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6154)|
| 1:42:38| Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6158)|
| 1:42:39| Okay. Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6159)|
| 1:42:42| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6162)|
| 1:42:44| Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6164)|

| 1:43:27| Esteemed members of the council, distinguished guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| today I come before you to advocate for a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| that speaks to the heart of our community's values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| with the Helen Ross McNabb Center, Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| to provide funding in the amount of $25,000 for essential services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| of the sexual assault center of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| This resolution is not just about dollars and cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| It is about upholding our collective responsibility to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6237)|
| 1:44:01| and protect survivors of sexual assault in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| First and foremost, let us acknowledge the gravity of the issue at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| Sexual assault is a pervasive and insidious crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| that inflicts immeasurable harm upon its victims,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| shattering lives and undermining the fabric of our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| As elected representatives, it is our duty to stand in solidarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6265)|
| 1:44:30| with survivors, to listen to their voices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| and to ensure that they receive the care, support, and justice they deserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6274)|
| 1:44:40| Furthermore, the essential services provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| by the sexual assault center of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| play a pivotal role in the healing and recovery process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| for survivors of sexual assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| From crisis intervention and counseling to advocacy and legal support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| these services offer a lifeline to individuals in their darkest hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6299)|
| 1:45:03| empowering them to reclaim their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| and assert their rights in the aftermath of trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| Moreover, let us recognize that our support for survivors of sexual assault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| extends far beyond the walls of any single organization or program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=6319)|

| 2:06:49| there are two people signed up to speak in opposition to this item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7609)|

| 2:06:54| We'll start with the person in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Haley Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Haley Field, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| and you have up to five minutes to address council on this Item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| My name is Haley Field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| My zip code is 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7628)|
| 2:07:12| I'm here to speak in support of Ordinance 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| This ordinance provides the authority to reappropriate non-project related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| encumbrances at the end of the current fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| and I believe this is an opportunity to reassess the city's priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7645)|
| 2:07:29| and to take steps towards addressing one of the most pressing issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| that the city has created, which is homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| Every night in and around Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7656)|
| 2:07:38| there are hundreds of individuals getting by without shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7658)|
| 2:07:42| without warmth, and without even the basic necessities of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| While the current proposal includes $8 million for housing initiatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7667)|
| 2:07:51| we urge this council to consider reallocating funds from other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7671)|
| 2:07:55| as is allowed by Ordinance 12A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| particularly from the excessive $79 million police budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| We know that in these conversations about the city budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| it's not just about balancing the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| It's about balancing the priorities of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| So we are left to wonder why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7692)|
| 2:08:14| when the city is deciding what to do with $79 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| its top priority is policing the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7699)|
| 2:08:22| and not offering a helping hand to those people who are living on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| Reappropriating and reallocating this money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| could make a tangible difference in the lives of our most vulnerable neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7710)|
| 2:08:34| And I would like to add also that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| what's missing from any conversation about our city budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7717)|
| 2:08:41| is that as we speak here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7721)|
| 2:08:45| our tax dollars are being used to fund the indiscriminate bombing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| of homes, hospitals, schools, and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7729)|
| 2:08:54| That is not germane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7734)|
| 2:08:58| Point of order, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7741)|
| 2:09:03| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| This speaker's comments are not germane to this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| Okay, I'm ruling you out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| Haley Field, you're out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7750)|

| 2:09:20| If you do not leave, you're going to be arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| Haley Field, you leave voluntarily or you'll be arrested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7763)|
| 2:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7767)|

| 2:09:56| Mr. Roach, you have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| You need to turn the microphone on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7801)|
| 2:10:06| There's a little button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| It's on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| I've spoken a few times when it's time to start getting the budget process rolling and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7809)|
| 2:10:23| it's a consistent thing and it's kind of tiring and I don't know what to say to you guys to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7823)|
| 2:10:37| start to listen to people. I'm gonna say this real quick and yes it does have to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7837)|
| 2:10:52| the budget. If you don't pay attention to the people as they are learning and trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7852)|
| 2:11:02| to figure out what this whole governance process is about because I'm still trying to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| some of this crap out too. If you don't do that you're gonna have a bunch of just grown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| people coming along who the only way that they feel like that they're being heard will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7872)|
| 2:11:20| be to be nothing but confrontational because they'll have it in their mind that that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7880)|
| 2:11:29| it. When I started dealing with community stuff I thought hey just let's just try and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7889)|
| 2:11:39| advocate and do all these different things and show up for meetings and people would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7899)|
| 2:11:44| invite me. Come on Rick let's talk. But when it got down to the money here's the good part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7904)|
| 2:11:53| when it got down to the money I got so much smoke blowing up my behind you can call me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7913)|
| 2:12:01| choo-choo. I'm serious. And so repeatedly, repeatedly when I thought the process was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7921)|
| 2:12:16| working when I thought in many cases it really wasn't city revenue that we were dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7936)|
| 2:12:23| because the city as we all know as this agenda can inform you gets its money from wherever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7943)|
| 2:12:32| they can get it because the honest part about this is the city doesn't have a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7952)|
| 2:12:41| to do city business. First and foremost it's alright to get your federal dollars back that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| tax money that people in Knoxville and Knox County have paid to the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7968)|
| 2:12:52| to the state government that's fine. But you get a large chunk of money that has to recirculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7972)|
| 2:13:01| back and keep in mind the state of Tennessee is a net blood sucker, okay? We don't pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7981)|
| 2:13:10| anything into federal taxes compared to what we get back. So we're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=7990)|
| 2:13:21| commitment. Let's talk about commitment real quick. This budget does not show a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8001)|
| 2:13:27| to the people most in need. And the fact that you have to vote on a budget in its entirety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8007)|
| 2:13:37| and then try and amend it and you guys know you all don't have a voice. You don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| a voice because she's already earmarked. And so whatever you work out you probably have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8022)|
| 2:13:49| to give a couple of pints of blood to make it happen, okay? And that's no way to do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8029)|
| 2:13:57| for other people to take care of the citizens of Knoxville. It's just not the way to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8037)|
| 2:14:03| it. And I don't know what you guys have to do to change this budget process, but I wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8043)|
| 2:14:11| you all would have the guts, the collective guts to flip the script, okay? Again, on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8051)|
| 2:14:21| sidebar, you've got these people here as annoying as they may be, guess what? They are exercising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8061)|
| 2:14:31| and teaching you all, if you want to hear it, how to do government, mayor. Okay? And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8071)|
| 2:14:42| they're learning and they're showing off what they're learning because you've already told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8082)|

| 2:15:12| All right. Ladies and gentlemen, I stand before you to strongly oppose Ordinance 12a, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8112)|
| 2:15:19| proposes the annual appropriations for several department agencies, funds, and cities of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8119)|
| 2:15:25| Knoxville for the fiscal period, beginning of July 21st, beginning of July 1st, 2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| and ending of June 30th, 2025. While budgeting is a critical aspect of governance, I cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| support this ordinance for several compelling reasons, chief among them being the disproportionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| allocation of funds to the police department, a wake of concerning incidents that and pressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8144)|
| 2:15:53| community needs. First and foremost, it is deeply troubling that the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8153)|
| 2:16:01| is allocated over $79 million in this budget, particularly when we are considering the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8161)|
| 2:16:09| events such as the fatal shooting of William Charles McBride and the shooting of an innocent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8169)|
| 2:16:15| black man earlier today. These tragic incidents have sparked outrage and raised serious questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8175)|
| 2:16:25| about police accountability and the need for systemic reforms. Allocating such a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8185)|
| 2:16:32| portion of the budget to the police department without addressing these concerns only serves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| to perpetuate a cycle of violence and mistrust in our communities. And as a note, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8197)|
| 2:16:44| is famous for having disproportionate violence against its black community. Moreover, while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8204)|
| 2:16:54| the police department receives a substantial allocation of resources, the city is allocating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8214)|
| 2:17:00| only $8 million to address the pressing issues of housing and homelessness. This stark disparity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8220)|
| 2:17:06| and funding priorities is unacceptable, especially considering the deepening housing crisis and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8226)|
| 2:17:13| the growing number of individuals experiencing homelessness in our city. We have a moral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8233)|
| 2:17:20| obligation to prioritize the need of the most vulnerable members of our community, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| budget fails to adequately address their plight. And I'm going to note time and time again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8246)|
| 2:17:33| this is my third time here, homelessness keeps being brought up in front of the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8253)|

| 2:17:51| accountability in the budgeting process. Without clear guidelines and oversight mechanisms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8271)|

| 2:18:06| trust in our government, which is already near zero. Furthermore, the budget fails to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8286)|

| 2:18:45| simply increasing policing. Moreover, the budget reflects a lack of long‑term vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8325)|
| 2:18:54| and strategic planning for the future of our city by focusing primarily on short‑term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8334)|

| 2:19:23| frustrated with the underfunded schools that we have here in Knoxville. In conclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8363)|
| 2:19:29| I urge each member of this council to reject the Ordinance 12A and demand a budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8369)|
| 2:19:34| reflects our community's values, priorities, and aspirations. We cannot continue to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8374)|
| 2:19:43| to prioritize the interests of law enforcement over the urgent needs of our residents, especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8383)|
| 2:19:49| those of us who are marginalized and vulnerable. Let us come together to demand accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8389)|
| 2:19:55| transparency, and equity in our budgeting process and work towards a city that truly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8395)|

| 2:20:28| a measure that proposes annual appropriations for the city of Knoxville for the upcoming fiscal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8428)|
| 2:20:32| year. While the Ordinance aims to allocate funds across various departments and agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| I must express my deep concerns regarding the budget that is being allocated to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8437)|

| 2:20:45| allocated to the police department in light of recent events. The fatal shooting of William| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8445)|
| 2:20:49| Charles McBride, a black man, by the police department has sparked outrage and raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| serious questions about the priorities reflected in this budget. Furthermore, as we grapple with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| a dire housing and homelessness crisis in our city, the paltry amount allocated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| address this pressing issue is wholly inadequate and completely unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| First and foremost, let us acknowledge the tragic loss of William Charles McBride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8466)|
| 2:21:14| whose life was cut short due to police violence. This incident has once again laid bare the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| systemic issues of racial bias and excessive use of force within our police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8479)|
| 2:21:27| In the face of such grave concerns, it is unconscionable to approve a budget that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8487)|
| 2:21:31| allocates over $79 million to the police department without addressing the urgent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| need for accountability, reform, and community-led solutions. Moreover, the staggering contrast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| between the funding allocated to the police department and the resources dedicated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8502)|
| 2:21:46| addressing homelessness is deeply troubling. With only $9,822,720 allocated in total to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8506)|

| 2:22:16| homelessness. Furthermore, the passage of Ordinance 12a perpetuates a cycle of over-policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8536)|
| 2:22:25| and under-investment in community-based solutions. By funneling excess resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8545)|
| 2:22:29| into law enforcement, we perpetuate a punitive approach to social issues that disproportionately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| impacts marginalized communities, exacerbates racial disparities, and undermines trust and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8554)|

| 2:22:49| particularly those who have been historically marginalized and disenfranchised. Instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8569)|

| 2:23:01| top-down, authoritarian approaches that only serve to further alienate and oppress those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8581)|
| 2:23:09| Moreover, the budgetary decisions outlined in Ordinance 12a are short-sighted and lack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8589)|
| 2:23:14| foresight into the long-term consequences of our actions. By neglecting to invest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8594)|
| 2:23:18| affordable housing, social services, and mental health resources, we perpetuate a cycle of poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8598)|
| 2:23:23| and despair that will continue to burden future generations. Instead of investing in punitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| measures that only serve to perpetuate cycles of violence and incarceration, we should prioritize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8608)|
| 2:23:34| investments in education, economic opportunity, and community empowerment to break the cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| of poverty and uplift all members of our community. In conclusion, I urge each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8618)|
| 2:23:47| to reject Ordinance 12a and demand a budget that reflects our values of equity, justice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8627)|
| 2:23:52| and compassion. We cannot continue to prioritize the interests of law enforcement over the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8632)|
| 2:23:57| of our most vulnerable community members. It is time to reimagine public safety, invest in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8637)|
| 2:24:02| community-led solutions, and build a city where everyone has access to safe, affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8642)|

| 2:24:38| There's a, I guess, there's a lot to cover, and I think we're not going to have it all time now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| but we'll have time in the legislative budget hearings. One of the things I wanted to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8683)|
| 2:24:48| that most people don't realize is that we all listen to our constituents throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8688)|
| 2:24:55| and we advocate for the things that are important, and many of those are raised tonight. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| I think there was a lot of misinformation that was shared tonight that I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| reflects the reality of any of our priorities as a council or of this budget, but we'll unpack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8705)|
| 2:25:12| that in the legislative hearing. I do want to address one of the items that was mentioned in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| its housing. It is the number one priority of this council. We had a retreat earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8717)|
| 2:25:23| We had a retreat earlier this year and established that as a top priority, and it has been. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8723)|
| 2:25:29| you... Members of the audience, you're disrupting the public meeting. You'll be asked to leave if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8729)|
| 2:25:35| you don't let them have their business. And if you genuinely seek to help people be housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8735)|
| 2:25:40| you can see those efforts reflected in our work. But I want to address a comment around the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8740)|
| 2:25:48| around the budget being $8 million for housing, either Deputy Chief Brace or Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| Ball or Mayor Kincaid. Would you address what that $8 million allows us to leverage or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8755)|
| 2:26:01| do that necessarily doesn't come out of our budget from a housing standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8761)|
| 2:26:05| Vice Mayor, I'll provide the initial answer, and if we need more details, I'm happy to turn it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8765)|

| 2:26:16| housing in particular, and this budget reflects that ongoing commitment. As you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| this council passed an ordinance where we were committed to a minimum of $50 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8783)|
| 2:26:28| $5 million a year for 10 years. Every single year since then, we've gone over that minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| and that money's been used towards permanent supportive housing, towards the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8793)|

| 2:26:49| $8 million or so a year, and the total amount that's been invested by the private sector is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8809)|
| 2:26:54| 15 times that. And so we've helped create and house many, many families who needed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| affordable housing. Of course, we understand that we need to do more, and that's why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| continuing to invest in transforming Western. We're continuing to invest in Callahan Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8824)|
| 2:27:09| We're continuing to invest in Liberty Place. And as you all know, we also have a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8829)|
| 2:27:16| philanthropic dollars that are going to contribute to that gap financing fund as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| So with those pledges, that would take it up to $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| Not all the departments in the budget, and there's a lot of details in this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8846)|
| 2:27:29| but not all the departments function in a way where you put some in and they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8849)|
| 2:27:34| 15 times that. So I think that's always something that if you're not aware of how the budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| works, most people in the public don't realize that. There's a lot more to discuss, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8860)|
| 2:27:48| will be discussed. The public's allowed to attend our legislative meeting, which is on May 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8868)|
| 2:27:54| I meant to mention this earlier in my remarks, but May 16th in this room at 8 o'clock, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8874)|
| 2:28:01| have a legislative hearing where we will unpack the budget in detail. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8881)|
| 2:28:08| Thank you. Any other? Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8888)|
| 2:28:15| Thank you, Mayor. I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8895)|
| 2:28:21| no secret that I feel there are many changes needed to our budgeting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8901)|
| 2:28:30| including the calendar still. My preference is that the public hearings, I would like the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8910)|
| 2:28:37| hearings to happen before this meeting, but by charter, we can't do that yet. But at minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8917)|
| 2:28:43| I'd like them closer to this meeting because that is when we really get into the meat of this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8923)|
| 2:28:50| and understand, following the Mayor's budget hearings and the requests made by departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8930)|
| 2:28:56| what requests were approved and what weren't, and that's when we really dig into it. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8936)|
| 2:29:00| my preference is that the public hearings are closer to this first reading, and then that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8940)|
| 2:29:05| gives us more time to consider revisions versus what we have currently. Also, each time we review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8945)|
| 2:29:16| the budget, we are reminded of what the charter says about passing it on first reading. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8956)|
| 2:29:22| we're not reminded each year about the Title VI reports that we're supposed to receive by May 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8962)|
| 2:29:30| and I wonder, are we going to receive them tomorrow? Because those are supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| a part of the budgeting process. We're not reminded about the five-year and 15-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8973)|
| 2:29:40| zoning plans that are required by charter that we don't comply with year after year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8980)|
| 2:29:48| But when it comes to the budget, all of a sudden, we have to comply with exactly what the charter says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8988)|
| 2:29:55| or else. I don't plan to vote in favor of this budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=8995)|
| 2:30:01| both to protest our budgeting process, which I think needs to be overhauled, but also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9001)|
| 2:30:09| because I'm simply in opposition to this budget. It takes my breath away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9009)|
| 2:30:18| to look at the police budget from four years ago. If you go back five years, I don't have it in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9018)|
| 2:30:25| of me, but I believe it was around $55 million, maybe $57 million. Four years ago, it was $61 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9025)|
| 2:30:34| Now, we're at $79 million. To compare that with fire, four years ago, fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9034)|
| 2:30:43| was at $45 million. Now, they're at $55 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9043)|
| 2:30:51| That budget's gone up $10 million. Police budget's gone up about $20 million in four years. Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9051)|
| 2:30:59| This is all happening during a period of time when all around the nation and even here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| our city, we've asked for police reform. We've demanded it. We've marched in the streets. We've come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9064)|
| 2:31:11| before our leaders with our own ideas. We've run people for office. We've secured seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9071)|
| 2:31:18| We've done so much work to try to keep our communities safer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9078)|
| 2:31:25| but we haven't committed to that earnestly as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| We did a reimagining policing process that took two seconds, created the co-responders program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9091)|
| 2:31:39| and we continue to see deaths at the hands of our police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9099)|
| 2:31:47| by people experiencing mental health crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9107)|
| 2:31:51| We continue to see it. We don't question it. We just move on, business as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9111)|
| 2:32:04| There's so much that we could do. There's so much more that we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| if we truly made a commitment to making the changes needed for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| Instead of, I can't think of a better way to say it than blow hot air. I can't think of a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9134)|
| 2:32:21| way of saying it, but we continue to say things that sound kind of good, but we ain't really doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9141)|
| 2:32:28| it. We're not doing it, and we're continuing to throw money at the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9148)|
| 2:32:36| in just shocking ways, and the result is we still have, what is it, 350 authorized officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9156)|
| 2:32:47| That's 20 something officers less than four or five years ago, so we're chasing after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9167)|
| 2:32:56| authorized number, but continue to move further and further away from 400 and something authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9176)|
| 2:33:03| officers. I can't support this budget. We can do better. Any further comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9183)|
| 2:33:20| Thank you, Mayor. I look forward to Council's legislative budget hearings as the Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9200)|
| 2:33:27| just discussed. Looking through the budget, I was really pleased to see that we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9207)|
| 2:33:32| 8% increase in the Affordable Housing Fund. We have an almost 10% increase in overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9212)|
| 2:33:38| homelessness prevention. I was really pleased to see $1.5 million for Vision Zero. That included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9218)|
| 2:33:48| there's also $500,000 in traffic calming. There's $500,000 in sidewalk repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9228)|
| 2:33:54| which is really needed. I wish there was money for new sidewalks, but I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9234)|
| 2:34:00| where we are with the budget. One of the things that I think a lot of folks may not understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9240)|
| 2:34:10| is that we have a jail diversion program called the BHUC, and that has diverted over 2,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9250)|
| 2:34:17| individuals from our judicial system, providing them compassionate community-based care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9257)|
| 2:34:23| since its inception, and that's something this Council has done. Now, one of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9263)|
| 2:34:28| that's on this budget that I think is really important is the MPATH, and that's our ER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9268)|
| 2:34:34| diversion for people in mental health crisis. And Mr. Brace, I think you've been kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9274)|
| 2:34:39| spearheading that. Can you maybe talk to us a little bit about where you are? I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9279)|
| 2:34:43| project's getting ready to open soon, and that's going to be a very important project for mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9283)|
| 2:34:47| health in our community. Yes, sir. David Brace, Chief of Staff. Yes, that facility is under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9287)|
| 2:34:53| construction. If you go by the St. Mary's campus, they are wrapping up the exterior and interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9293)|
| 2:34:59| work. I would need to check on the latest date. I want to say it's the end of this summer, but I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9299)|
| 2:35:04| need to get back to Council on the exact date, but that will be an important urgent care facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9304)|
| 2:35:08| for North Knoxville. It will also be a place where individuals that need care but not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9308)|
| 2:35:16| sitting in the ER but actually quality mental health care can get that sooner and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| efficiently. Thank you very much. Thank you. Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9320)|
| 2:35:26| Thank you, Mayor. I think it's really important also to raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9326)|
| 2:35:32| my concerns around the salary increases. We've just recently, in the last couple years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9332)|
| 2:35:40| went through a comprehensive process to evaluate and increase salary among city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9340)|
| 2:35:50| And Council approved a property tax increase to fund this increase in wages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9350)|
| 2:36:02| In this budget, there's a significant wage increase for KPD officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9362)|
| 2:36:10| that didn't go through that evaluation that we did a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9370)|
| 2:36:16| And what I'm concerned about is a couple of years ago, we identified the increased property tax as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9376)|
| 2:36:22| the source of income for that salary increase, but we were told because of the step increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9382)|
| 2:36:29| included in the automatic, you know, raises that would happen each year, that eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9389)|
| 2:36:37| that salary increase would catch up with that property increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9397)|
| 2:36:47| And the property tax increase would no longer pay for that salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9407)|
| 2:36:52| So then we have to rely on other revenue sources or another property tax increase is needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9412)|
| 2:37:01| So now we're increasing KPD wages. We're not thinking about anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9421)|
| 2:37:07| There's a few other positions in here that are getting moved around, but we're not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9427)|
| 2:37:11| a comprehensive look. We're increasing some KPD wages and we're saying, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9431)|
| 2:37:17| we got sales tax revenue that's coming in. It's doing great, so we can cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9437)|
| 2:37:24| Okay, so what happens in 2017 when the other salary increases catch up with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9444)|
| 2:37:29| tax increase? I guess that's for the next mayor to worry about. And that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| People don't understand that, you know, some of the line items that are increasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9455)|
| 2:37:47| by small percentages, those should be increasing because we're seeing this increased sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9467)|
| 2:37:56| Sales tax. But something like, you know, some pretty substantial salary increases need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9476)|
| 2:38:05| a substantial, steady, reliable source of income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9485)|
| 2:38:13| And I'm worried that we're kicking the ball down the field a bit too much on some reoccurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9493)|
| 2:38:19| expenses that we're hoping, I imagine, you know, an increase in sales taxes will cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9499)|
| 2:38:28| five years from now. Or we're expecting another mayor to have to do a property tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9508)|
| 2:38:38| That's another reason why I'm not able to support this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| It concerns me. When we had our initial conversation about salary increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| there was talk of those, for example, in public service who are at the lower end of that pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9530)|
| 2:39:01| And as I saw this budget come forward, you know, I thought about those workers. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9541)|
| 2:39:09| I don't know exactly who's out during these winter storms working 24-7. I don't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9549)|
| 2:39:15| that's our lowest paid or if that's our highest paid. I imagine it's our lower paid. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9555)|
| 2:39:23| are they going to be considered for another raise? When is that going to happen? Because now we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9563)|
| 2:39:28| got our current pay scale we've got to be able to cover after 2027, another pay raise that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9568)|
| 2:39:34| got to be able to cover looking at sales tax increases. But no plan to look at those lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9574)|
| 2:39:42| level, lower paid employees to determine how they might. Because we knew at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| when the pay increase was approved, we knew at the time inflation was going to hit and this pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9589)|
| 2:39:56| increase ain't going to do much. So we're going to need another adjustment for those at the lower end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9596)|
| 2:40:02| of the scale. But I'm concerned that we're not doing the proper planning. We're, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9602)|
| 2:40:12| throwing money at the KPD once again. I mean they came to a city council dinner and we have one KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9612)|

| 2:40:28| is needed to improve recruitment. It's not enough. Thank you. Council members, just for your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9628)|
| 2:40:38| information, of course we did a lot of study with the HR department and our consultants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9638)|
| 2:40:44| the same ones who did the comprehensive study two years ago. So it's very much data based and based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9644)|
| 2:40:50| on the labor economics of what's happening in law enforcement right now here and across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9650)|
| 2:40:57| And I want to make sure all of you, in addition to your legislative budget hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9657)|
| 2:41:01| if you want to sit down, Ms. Parker with my chief of staff, David Brace, he is willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9661)|
| 2:41:06| sit with you or any other member of council and share with you the details of how we propose this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| you know, why we're proposing this raise. There's also a two and a half percent raise for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9674)|
| 2:41:18| employees and 4.2 percent for all uniform employees, including our firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9678)|
| 2:41:24| Just as a point of information. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| Okay. But can we have to clarify that? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9688)|
| 2:41:31| Now council has already approved the 2.5 percent raise. This is not a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9691)|
| 2:41:38| salary raise. This was a part of the comprehensive study. Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9698)|
| 2:41:44| Correct. The increase for firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9704)|
| 2:41:49| Can you expound on that and tell us more about the increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9709)|
| 2:41:52| That was due to the salary step schedule that the board, the council adopted as part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9712)|
| 2:41:58| comprehensive study. Okay. Thank you. So that's from two years ago. These increases are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9718)|
| 2:42:04| continue to show up in our budget because we approved them two years ago and we have to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| them into account each budget year because these costs continue to increase. That's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9728)|
| 2:42:13| our property tax won't cover it in five years or four years or however long it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9733)|
| 2:42:19| Mr. Brace, do you want to provide more light on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9739)|
| 2:42:22| Yeah, I think it's important to clarify and we can get into this during obviously the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9742)|
| 2:42:27| hearings, the legislative budget hearings, but the step program. So there's the standard two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9747)|
| 2:42:32| and a half percent cost of living that is in code and that is integrated into the budget annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9752)|
| 2:42:38| That is in code and that is integrated into the budget annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| And then the step program that happened for uniform bodies after about an 11% to 15% adjustment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9762)|
| 2:42:50| one-time adjustment, that actually has a sunset and so that does not go on in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9770)|
| 2:42:55| And so what the mayor always committed to was the step program for a set number of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9775)|
| 2:42:59| and then we would reevaluate all salaries and compensation towards the end of your administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9779)|
| 2:43:07| So those do go away. The extra steps would have to be reevaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9787)|
| 2:43:15| Any other questions or comments? Seeing none. Oh, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9795)|
| 2:43:20| Thank you, Mayor. This is just a question for the workshop. I don't expect anybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9800)|
| 2:43:25| know this now, but I do know that, you know, we have the TIFs and the PILOTs and they eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9805)|
| 2:43:31| roll off and we get the new tax revenue based on the new appraised value after we made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9811)|
| 2:43:38| investment. From time to time we get a schedule of when some of those should start hitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9818)|
| 2:43:45| That would be nice to also have available as we talk about the increase in salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| Our tax revenue will increase based on some of those things and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9833)|
| 2:44:00| that's just something I'd like to have as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9840)|
| 2:44:04| Absolutely. Mr. Evans, CFO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9844)|
| 2:44:06| Yes, ma'am. Councilwoman Fugate, it's, yeah, I know RJ is already working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9846)|
| 2:44:11| we were just talking about it, like, you know, PILOTs and TIFs roll off and what that does and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| so forth, but also every year we have real growth, which usually averages between one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9857)|
| 2:44:26| percent. That doesn't sound like a whole lot, but when you apply that to the total amount of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9866)|
| 2:44:32| tax, it's substantial and it's moving more toward the two percent mark now because of all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9872)|
| 2:44:39| construction, remodeling and so forth, so that is very helpful as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9879)|
| 2:44:44| Thank you for mentioning that. You told us that at our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| our mid-year budget retreat, and I forgot to mention that, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| Any other questions or comments? Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9892)|

| 2:45:03| I think we can do a motion to postpone the second reading for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9903)|
| 2:45:08| Do we have to do a motion to postpone the second reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9908)|
| 2:45:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9910)|
| 2:45:12| Okay. Council, because we usually do second reading two weeks after the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| has suggested that we do an official motion to do the second reading in May, Tuesday, May 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9918)|
| 2:45:25| in four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| I'll make that motion to postpone the second reading to May 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| Okay. Motion's been made and seconded. Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9930)|

| 2:45:42| 12B is an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties, real, personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9942)|
| 2:45:46| and mixed within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville to provide sufficient revenues to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9946)|

| 2:46:11| and both in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9971)|
| 2:46:13| First is Madison Funk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9973)|
| 2:46:16| You have up to five minutes to speak to council on item 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9976)|
| 2:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=9997)|
| 2:46:40| Ladies and gentlemen, today I rise to vehemently oppose ordinance 12B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| which proposes to levy a tax on all payable properties within the City of Knoxville to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10005)|
| 2:46:49| fund the general fund and debt service fund operations and obligations for the upcoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10009)|
| 2:46:54| fiscal period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10014)|
| 2:46:55| This ordinance represents an unjust burden on the hardworking citizens of Knoxville who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10015)|
| 2:47:00| should not be forced to bear the brunt of the city's fiscal mismanagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| First and foremost, it is unconscionable to ask taxpayers to foot the bill on the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| financial shortcomings, the imposition of additional taxes on already struggling residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10029)|
| 2:47:15| is unfair and disproportionate, especially considering the lack of accountability and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| transparency in how previous funds have been allocated and managed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10039)|
| 2:47:23| It is simply unjust to expect ordinary citizens to shoulder the consequences of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10043)|
| 2:47:28| fiscal irresponsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10048)|
| 2:47:30| Moreover, the proposal to levy a tax without addressing the root causes of the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10050)|
| 2:47:35| financial challenges is short-sighted and misguided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10055)|
| 2:47:38| Rather than imposing additional financial burdens on residents, the city should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10058)|
| 2:47:42| focused on implementing measures to improve fiscal discipline, streamline operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10062)|
| 2:47:47| and identify efficiencies to reduce costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10067)|
| 2:47:51| Punishing taxpayers with higher taxes is not a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10071)|
| 2:47:55| It is a band-aid approach that fails to address the underlying issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10075)|
| 2:48:01| Additionally, there is lack of transparency and accountability in how tax revenues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10081)|
| 2:48:05| allocated and inspected by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10085)|
| 2:48:07| Without clear oversight mechanisms and accountability measures in place, there is a risk that taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10087)|
| 2:48:12| dollars could be wasted or misappropriated, further eroding public trust and confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10092)|
| 2:48:17| in the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10097)|
| 2:48:18| Before asking for more money from taxpayers, the city must demonstrate a commitment to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10098)|
| 2:48:23| be responsible financially in their management and stewardship of public funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10103)|
| 2:48:29| Furthermore, imposing additional taxes on property owners could have a devastating consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10109)|
| 2:48:34| for low-income families and vulnerable communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10114)|
| 2:48:38| Many residents are already struggling to make ends meet, I'm one of them, and higher property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10118)|
| 2:48:43| taxes could push them further into financial hardship, forcing some to choose between paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10123)|
| 2:48:49| their taxes and meeting their basic needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10129)|

| 2:48:58| Moreover, the proposal to levy a tax without exploring alternative revenue sources or cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10138)|
| 2:49:04| saving measures is short-sighted and lacks creativity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| Rather than resorting to an easy solution of raising taxes, the city should be exploring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10149)|
| 2:49:15| innovative approaches to generate revenue and reduce expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240430?start=10155)|
