| 0:01:16| I'd like to, if I could, take a moment of privilege to, instead of setting the agenda, go back to, I think we wanted to move, there's two items I want to move to the front and here as quickly as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=76)|
| 0:01:23| The first item is the KCDC, what number was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=83)|
| 0:01:32| 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Do you all mind if we do that ahead of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| I think the mayor wants to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| I think Alvin's here so we want to, all those folks who are involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=97)|
| 0:01:41| Can we go ahead and do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=101)|
| 0:01:44| You have to form a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| Yeah, I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=107)|
| 0:01:50| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=110)|
| 0:01:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=114)|
| 0:01:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| Do you want it read into the record, Tim, or please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=119)|
| 0:02:05| Item number 44 is a presentation by Mayor Tim Burchett proclaiming April is Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=125)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| Tim Burchett, 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| This month is Fair Housing Month and we have a proclamation for Knox County honoring that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=140)|
| 0:02:28| I think it's good that we note these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Somebody asked me one time, you know, you note these things, what's the purpose in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| And I said it's a good purpose, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| You reward football players and they make a good play, they put a sticker on their helmet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=156)|
| 0:02:41| and I don't believe anybody's going to tell one of those NFL players that they shouldn't have those stickers on their helmets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=161)|
| 0:02:46| And in that same regard, you know, Alex Haley used to have a saying, he said, find the good and praise it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| And that's really, this is something that in our lifetime was not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| There was times when people were denied housing and I'm proud to say that Knox County takes a strong stand for fair housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| And I'll just read a little bit of that, if that's okay, and then Rebecca Gibson's up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| If you want to have all your people come up and stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| For all the people that are here with her, stand up behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| Would that be fine, Rebecca?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| All right, and I'll just read a small portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| The month of April is recognized by federal, state, and local government as Fair Housing Month in recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| These governments are joined by property owners and managers, realtors, financial institutions, landlords, tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| and all those committed to the equality of our country's citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| and the importance of their fundamental moral and constitutional rights, which prohibit, among other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=211)|
| 0:03:37| discrimination in housing on the basis of race or color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| And those are just a few of the good things that are in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=225)|
| 0:03:47| But at this time, if it's all right, Mr. Chairman, if I could ask Rebecca to come up and say a few brief comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| I said brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| He said brief, and I will be very brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=235)|
| 0:03:57| We are so appreciative of Knox County Community Development for the individuals and agencies that help us serve in the utilization of HUD funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| And we could not do our jobs well without our good partners in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| And I have invited several of our housing partners here that are nonprofit agencies, and I'm just going to call them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=248)|
| 0:04:14| And if you could kind of, they're right behind me, but several of these people you may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| Representing Community Action Coalition is Barbara Kelly and Jason Estes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| Representing Helen Ross McNabb is Michael Waltke and Jana Morgan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Representing KCDC is Alvin Nance, Art Cate, and Sean Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| Representing Habitat for Humanity, and I don't know if Kelly made it or not, but Kelly was supposed to be here, but they just ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=278)|
| 0:04:40| And Knox Housing Partnership, Jackie Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| And we have Neighborhood Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| We have Adam Montgomery and David Ault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| And I don't know, we had invited U.S. Housing and Urban Development Field Representative Suzanne Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| I don't know who ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Hi, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| We have 100 percent attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| This is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| But we really could not do it without these agencies, and we are so appreciative of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=298)|
| 0:05:02| They sacrifice to serve individuals that have very, very hard life circumstances, and we just wanted to honor them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=302)|
| 0:05:09| And April is Fair Housing Month for the entire nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| HUD declares that, and we just wanted to honor them today by their service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=312)|
| 0:05:16| And I would be remiss if I did not mention our staff, who works very, very hard to be in compliance with a highly regulated program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=316)|
| 0:05:23| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| Mr. Chairman, I would like to also note, about 20 years ago, I worked on a Habitat for Humanity house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| And this ‑‑ two weekends ago, I went to a get‑together where they just paid that house off down on, I believe it was Haylor Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=335)|
| 0:05:43| And it was just ‑‑ and I talked to the families that were around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| You know, when we built that house, there was a lot of folks that were involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| The one thing you didn't hear was children's laughter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| And, Mr. Chairman, you being a father, as you are, I know you like that noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| And that's all you could hear was just kids running and playing, and it just had transformed that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| And I'm proud to stand with these folks and the great work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Applause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| The next item before we set our agenda, if you guys don't mind, is a discussion item in regards to Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| I think Amy brought it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=383)|
| 0:06:24| And I have invited Kim Bumpus, the president down from Visit Knoxville, who is ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| I could explain it to you, but she could make it understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| So Kim, is Kim still in the room?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| There she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| I'll give Amy the floor, and thank you for coming, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=405)|
| 0:06:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Hey, Kim, thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=410)|
| 0:06:51| Hey, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| I was just hoping that you could explain this a little bit more about why you're charging, how much you're charging,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| how all that's going to work, and the reasoning behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| What we're trying to do with Boomsday is we want to take Boomsday to the next level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| so that we are competing with our partners like Thunder Over Louisville and River Bend and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| primarily more like Thunder Over Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| And the way you do that with an event like Boomsday is you've got to program it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| And so what we want to do is change Boomsday into a secured, programmed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=441)|
| 0:07:27| And that's where the charge is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| Good news, Boomsday is still a fireworks display programmed to music that can be seen for free all over Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=448)|
| 0:07:36| And we'll still be promoting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=456)|
| 0:07:38| But if you want to come down on the riverfront for an experience that has stages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=458)|
| 0:07:44| and better food and beverage offerings and performances, that's what your $20 admission will get you into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| And what about the people who arrive by boat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| We are still working through some of the logistics of the boats, so I don't really have an answer for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| We will have an answer to all logistics by the time we go on sale, which is going to be mid to late June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=480)|
| 0:08:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| And I just have to say I understand what you're trying to achieve, but I do oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| This is something that has always been free for every Knoxvillian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| You go down there early, you get a good spot, you have a good time, you have vendors, you know, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| But $20 a person, you know, my family will stand on the back porch of our house and watch the fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=505)|
| 0:08:32| It's something that will price our family out of participating anymore in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| And that's not just true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| I mean, that's true for – that's what I'm hearing from a lot of people, especially in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| is that this is something that they felt was always for all Knoxvillians equally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| and they're being priced out of participating in something that's traditionally been for Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| So I'm sorry, but I oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Well, and I understand your opinion, and I've talked to several people that have had an opinion like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| But here's the good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=544)|
| 0:09:05| We're really not taking anything away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| We're giving more, and that's what the vesting by the patron will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| The fireworks display will still be for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| And here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I don't know if you were down at Boomsday the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| but at the end of the day, from 1 to 6, there's very few people and no programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| not a whole lot to do except, like you said, come down, kind of camp out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| not really have an opportunity to spend a lot of money or choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| You came down, they brought coolers, backpacks, very hard to police for a free event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| At the end of the day, what we want to do is provide something for that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| So fireworks will still be free, and you're still going to have a tremendous amount of places to watch that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| In fact, we're working at building out across the river a free opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| But if you want to listen to music, have a different experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=594)|
| 0:09:58| which is what we want visitors that come to Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| and stay in hotel rooms along with our community, we want to provide that for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=601)|
| 0:10:06| And that's the reason for the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| Well, I disagree very much with the statement that you're not taking anything away from people because you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| I guess I'll just say, just in the way of a comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| I mean hopefully you all have taken data over the many years you've had this Boomsday event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| I would hope that you all are wise in continuing that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| If this doesn't work out like you have on the whiteboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| and your attendance starts to erode or you're seeing a dynamic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| that may not be building toward the future, that you will act early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=641)|
| 0:10:47| Because if you let it, well, let's try it again next year, let's try it again next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| you can end up with something lost, and that would be a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| So I'm going to reserve comment on the pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| I think Commissioner Burroughs makes a lot of good points, as you probably heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| So I'll just say I would hope that you're monitoring very, very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| Are you getting the uptick where you want the upticks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| and are you getting the downticks where you didn't anticipate the downticks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| And don't be as soóI know you're not, I'm not talking about you personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| but don't be so proud as to say we've done it, we better stick with it for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| And I think Visit Knoxville has proven that we are a very fluid organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| so we'll be watching all of that, and we take all of the feedback seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| and we care about it, so we will be watching that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| And I do understand that you want to pull more people into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| to stay in hotel rooms and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| There are other opportunities for that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Boomsday has always been for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| That's how it's always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| and I feel like that's not necessarily what the eye is on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| Well, again, I hope to be able to have a more robust conversation about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| after we see the effects of this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| but we will exceed people's expectations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| and there's going to be programs for people to get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| and have this experience that maybe don't have the $20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| or don't choose to vest their $20 in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Well, see, it's not just $20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| When you're talking about a family of four, you're talking about $80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| My family's not going to spend $80 to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| and get a prime seat for something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| that's always been free and available to all Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Well, and I would love to show you kind of the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Once we get the logistics built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| so that you can see where there is opportunity for both experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| both free and programmed, there's going to be that opportunity, I assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| But, like you said, the primary vendors and all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| are going to be in the pay area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| You still don't have a plan about the people who come in by boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Those are huge concerns of mine as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| And I would love to sit down and walk you through those logistics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| once we have those wrapped up, probably in about 15 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Everybody hang onto your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| I agree with Amy on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| I'm glad I can provide something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| And when we had our discussion a couple of months ago, we met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| I voiced my concern that the fee, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| is going to draw less people once they find out that there's a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=807)|
| 0:13:35| I've had numerous emails and phone calls over this since it was launched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| In the newspaper, people are saying, we can't afford to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| And I'm concerned, like Amy is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| that the food vendors are going to be inside the pay wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| and there's not going to be that for the free people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| And I don't go anymore because I don't like the crowds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| It's just too big for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| But my kids like to go, and they're adults now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| But for him to take his son, you're talking $40 for a single dad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| and that's a lot of money just so they can enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| So I think it's going to have a counter effect on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| I think it's really going to hurt attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| But we'll see how it goes this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Jim, what's the kids or what's the age limit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Twelve and under are free, and military is free with an ID as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=872)|
| 0:14:33| Okay. Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| You know, if you stood on the other side of the river| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=876)|
| 0:14:39| and closed your eyes and visualized that whole scenario across the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| we're talking about a very small portion of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| that would be designated as this pay zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=888)|
| 0:14:53| As far as the events, you know, there will be more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| They're going to be paying for the extra events that are in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| These are events that normally somebody else may not want to go to anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| But if you look at the broad expanse of area on both sides of where this will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| there are still many, many thousands of people that can be there free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| And there will also be vendors for inside and outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| I mean, they're not going to be just compounded off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=921)|
| 0:15:25| and everybody outside has to suck eggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| I mean, they'll have the same type of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| vittles available out there as they have inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| So I think it could be a great event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| particularly if we come up with one venue across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| Well, here's another issue I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| Not only are people paying to get inside that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| they're going to have to pay those vendors too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| So it's not just $80 for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| It's $80 plus whatever you want to spend on those vendors once you're in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| So that's also an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| This could ramp up to be a very expensive thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=961)|
| 0:16:04| which previously has not been and has been always for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| True, and it's still all for the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| And the Family Fun Zone, just for your reference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| will be outside the $20 pay area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=976)|
| 0:16:21| Go ahead, Commissioner Spence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Kim, could you maybe send us or e-mail us a map of the whole area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| and then shade the area that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=986)|
| 0:16:29| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| And just for your reference, because we've already said this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=990)|
| 0:16:32| and kind of talked about it on radio interviews and TV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| and just if it helps any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| I understand the passionate opinions of those that think they can't afford it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| or choose that that's not the way they want to spend their $20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| and I understand that and respect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| But I have also received numerous, if not more, e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1006)|
| 0:16:49| from people that are excited about the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| especially as it relates to visitors outside of our region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| that might like to come and experience this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| Also, if you talk to Pyro Shows, who is our partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| this is the last really stand-alone, break-even fireworks show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| that was unprogrammed leading up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| So that's really not an event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1027)|
| 0:17:10| That's not like a festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| It's a fireworks display, and it still will be a fireworks display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| But I'll map everything out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| But right now it's really from G-10 to in the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| where people couldn't have gotten anyway, at Roost Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And that's where some of the staging will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| There will be three stages, a water stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| We have a lot of partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1046)|
| 0:17:28| It's going to be a great event, and I guarantee you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| we will exceed anyone's expectation that chooses to spend their $20 in that fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| And we'll also be promoting all the areas you can watch for free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| that will be programmed for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| All right. Thanks, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Let's get back to our regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| I sent out a consent earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| First of all, let's talk about the additions, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| There's going to be an email to you in the next day or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1078)|
| 0:18:01| and I'm going to add this as an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| Knox County Sheriff's Office and KUB have agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1084)|
| 0:18:07| KUB is selling the Sheriff's Office a piece of property on Barnard Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1087)|

| 0:18:15| and goes to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| We'll get that in hopefully the next couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| On your desk you have from Cliff Rogers an additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| it's a $101,250 grant from the state for election machine leases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1107)|

| 0:18:36| There's no out-of-county expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1116)|

| 0:18:45| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1125)|

| 0:18:52| to create a fetal infant mortality review board here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| They have these across the state and in several other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| We have not had the funding for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| so it will allow us to do investigations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| but also have a group that creates a plan based on the data gathered from these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1146)|
| 0:19:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1155)|

| 0:20:06| And also number 38 and number 40, I both want to postpone until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1206)|
| 0:20:13| I'm sorry, I just have not felt up to doing the research for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| that I had intended to do due to my surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1218)|

| 0:20:27| Without objection, I'll add everybody on number 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1227)|

| 0:20:32| Commissioner Olenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Yes, I'd like to, if they don't mind, add my name to 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and I'm already on 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1234)|

| 0:21:02| That's on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| Could you pull that from consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| No, I'm not kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| No, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| And while we're at it, I'm going to add an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| To number 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1274)|

| 0:21:21| If I could have my name added to number 8, the women's basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1281)|
| 0:21:33| Do you want to be added to something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1295)|

| 0:21:46| Thank you for adding the line transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| I'd like to defer for 30 days, 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| 901 is 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1314)|
| 0:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| I'm going to give you the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Or the actually the non-consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| And 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| And 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1343)|

| 0:22:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| So non-on-consent would be 7, 10, 30, 31, 33, and 38.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1347)|
| 0:22:33| And the new additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| Question on number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| Do you want to pull 14?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Yeah, just a quick question on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| Any other items to be pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1371)|

| 0:23:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1388)|

| 0:23:25| of Tennessee's men's basketball team and coach, Konzo Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1405)|

| 0:23:35| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| And Larry, you may want to speak to this first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| You're welcome to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| If you want me to go, I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I just wanted to thank the team, you know, for the coaches and the teams for making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| to this week's 16, and the same for the women doing what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I did, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| And obviously, sports are a very important part of our community, and I was just very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1434)|
| 0:24:02| disappointed that the way this whole thing was handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1442)|
| 0:24:06| And I even, I wrote Konzo and wrote him a letter, and he responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1446)|
| 0:24:11| And I called Dave Hart, and I was just very curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| At the Dogwood event, the luncheon that we had, the city council folks were sitting across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| from us, and I went over to a couple of them, and I said, hey, we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| I mean, nothing is being done for this team and for this coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1467)|
| 0:24:33| This is like maybe the brightest sports thing that's happened at UT in a decade from the men's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Nothing's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| I thought it was just extremely strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| And so that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| I mean, I'm just so disappointed in how things are going from that standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1492)|
| 0:24:59| I don't know what goes on inside, you know, the athletic department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| But as a lifelong fan of UT sports, it just seems like, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| How did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1512)|
| 0:25:14| I don't know how things that are so obviously good go basically unrecognized by our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1514)|
| 0:25:24| I'm like, why didn't Thompson Bowling open up, and let's go over and have a celebration of what happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1524)|
| 0:25:31| especially after all the bizarre stuff with Pearl and petitions and the new Sentinel coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1531)|
| 0:25:41| It was just bizarre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| I was just so disappointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| I'm like ashamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| I'm ashamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I just want to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| You know, Tony, on the same token, especially from the men's side, look at all the graduating seniors that we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| I hate to see those guys, and same for the ladies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| I think there's one senior lady, but we need to do something for the men and women that are leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| and celebrate their career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| A lot of times coaches will just up and leave, and I mean they pack them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1574)|
| 0:26:18| They're boxed up in four hours, and they're gone, and the players are left standing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1578)|
| 0:26:22| They're still finishing up classes and whatnot right now, but I'd like to see something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Jolie, could you check just one more, at the basketball office, if the coaches cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| especially on the men's side because the women, they're intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| I think sure that they'll do, but especially ask the players, could they be here in attendance if they don't have class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1593)|
| 0:26:42| One last thing that I would like to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| I just do not understand how somebody like Konzo, who runs such a clean program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1604)|
| 0:26:53| is a wonderful mentor and is successful and is not appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| I just do not understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| The players appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| Thank you, sir, and I echo everything Commissioner Norman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| It is a shame, and I kind of take it personally because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| that's what happens when people are silent throughout that whole process, petition process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| when it kind of got ugly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| The administration over at UT was silent, but the community was silent, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| You know, 36,000 across the country out of the millions of UT fans out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1650)|
| 0:27:36| a majority of them did not feel that way, but we remained silent, so I'm going to own that piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1656)|
| 0:27:43| and that's why I turned my light on here to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1663)|
| 0:27:48| The strongest statement I heard Coach Martin make was, I guess, in the post-interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| when he was talking about John L. Stokes coming back to finish up a class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| so that he can have an APR of 1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| That means all of his student-athletes were just that, student-athletes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| That is unbelievable, unlike the previous coach who got us in all kinds of trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| not really caring what the students did, to be quite honest, academically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| So, you know, it had to be tough for the man and the staff and the trainers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| and everyone associated with the program to be doing the things right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| and in the right way to have that happen is a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| So, again, I'm going to own my piece of it by saying I should have spoken out a little more about that earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| Like I said, plan something, open up the venue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| I mean, show up and just have a pep rally for a team that got to the Sweet 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| which by all folks accounts is tougher than making a BCS Bowl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1728)|
| 0:28:54| I mean, so it really was remarkable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1734)|
| 0:28:57| So congratulations to the team, and I agree with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1737)|
| 0:29:00| that we could get them over here to say some folks around here really appreciate the job that you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| a lot of folks, a majority of the people, but just to do an outward expression would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| All right, we have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| On page two, item number 10, is a resolution reappointing Archie Johnson and appointing Joe Gufon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| and as members and appointing as an alternate on the Knox County Board of Equalization, this is resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| Move no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| We don't have a name yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| We don't have any names yet, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1779)|
| 0:29:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| All right, we have a motion and a second to move without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1785)|
| 0:29:47| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| On page three, item number 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1791)|
| 0:29:54| is a resolution approving a contract with Black Creek Integrated Systems Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| for the provision of jail security system upgrades in the amount of $299,998| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1798)|
| 0:30:04| for the system upgrade in the first year and $16,100 for support each year thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| First year funded in current budget resolution 304.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| So, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| We have a motion and a second. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| J.J., you just want to explain what that is a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1820)|
| 0:30:22| Yeah, it's basically Black Creek is the company that initially installed the security system at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1822)|
| 0:30:29| It was put up for bid and they were the only company that bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| And it's just security upgrades, locks, doors, touch screen monitors, new video equipment, those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| Is this the kiosks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Well, it's not. It's different. That's a communication deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| We have a motion on the floor with a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| On page eight, item number 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| a resolution approving an agreement of sale in the amount of $30,000 with Dan Harb and Albert Harb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| for property located at 7215 Middlebrook Park, also known as the historic Katie Miller House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| Agreement does not require an expenditure of funds. Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| We have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1884)|
| 0:31:25| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Any opposed? The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| Item number 31 is approving a formal general fund operating reserve policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| I'd like to move this without recommendation because I think I may have a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| Do you want to talk about it now or do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1909)|
| 0:31:51| Well, Chris, it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1913)|
| 0:31:54| Yes, but I'd like to keep the motion if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| I guess I'm trying to find out the genesis of this, and let me throw out my theories, probably incorrect theories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1920)|
| 0:32:11| Are you wanting to set up a minimum, you know, you can spin down to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1931)|
| 0:32:20| I guess I'm trying to understand we're in great shape now, and we're going to continue to be in great shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1940)|
| 0:32:27| So I guess I'm trying to understand why we're doing this or proposing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| It's not trying to spin down, so I'll say that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Basically, our external auditors have requested that we, what we would say is reduce our fund balance policy to riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1956)|
| 0:32:47| We've always had a fund balance policy through the recommendations of GFOA that we follow, but we have never put them in riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| And so basically every year we have an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| Our external auditors will say you should put your policies in riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1979)|
| 0:33:05| Every year when we go and have a conversation with our rating agencies over our bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| they will recommend that you have a fund balance policy in riding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1991)|
| 0:33:15| So in doing so, we come up with a policy basically by looking at other policies across the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=1995)|
| 0:33:23| and looking at the recommendations of GFOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| And basically what GFOA says to us is you should have a reserve policy of no less than two months' worth of revenues or expenditures in your reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2006)|
| 0:33:40| So we chose to go to three months because it's higher than two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| And currently we have about four, between four and five months in reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| So our goal is not to spend it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| It's just to have a policy in place to say for in the future we will not spend down below that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2035)|
| 0:34:02| and also kind of give an overview of when we're spending reserve dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| what it should be spent for and what it shouldn't be spent for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| and to make sure that we're always in compliance with our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Because if it's just in our heads, then it's not really a written policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| You know, and I'm fine with the latter part of what you said as far as what you can use it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2061)|
| 0:34:28| But I guess in terms of was three a random number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| Was three taken from AAA-rated cities and municipalities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Are AAA-rated cities and municipalities two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| So I guess I'm just trying to understand the driver for the number, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| So hopefully if the number gets us somewhere where we want to go, I'm fine with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| If it's just we want to just be overly conservative, then no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Let's go with standard policy, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| I would say this, that we have saw anywhere probably between two and five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| I think three is a good number because we are told over and over by our rating agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| that our healthy fund balance offsets our high debt, and that leads us to our AA-plus bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2111)|
| 0:35:19| And so we felt that it was important for us to use a number that was higher than what GFOA would recommend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2119)|
| 0:35:27| But you don't want to get too high because, as an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| Hamilton County has a fund balance of $104 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2131)|
| 0:35:36| Their operating budget is similar to ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| Now, they're a AAA city, but at what point do you get to where it's too high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| And it looks bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| I think three months is 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| It's higher than what GFOA recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I think our rating agency will look at that and say, kudos to you all for going above and beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| but it's not too high to where you don't get your hands wet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| Just a quick question, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2165)|
| 0:36:06| That's exclusive of schools, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| This is just general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Just a general fund policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Do you think you would run the risk of meeting that threshold and even more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2172)|
| 0:36:18| and then go through what we just will probably go through next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| Well, you've got plenty of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| Why don't you spend it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| You make your $20 million ahead of your threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2184)|
| 0:36:27| Why don't you spend it on the teacher raises or police cars or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| You know, it's always a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| I just think this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| As long as we're prudent in what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| we know what we should and should not spend fund balance dollars on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| It's one-time expenditures, never recurring, and that's in this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2203)|
| 0:36:50| I think when you look at setting a floor, you're not setting a floor to say let's spend down to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2210)|
| 0:36:57| You're just setting a floor to say, okay, if we get below that floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| then we need to come up with a policy to get it back to where it's supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| The floor is greater than what GFOA recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| This basically was a recommendation by our external auditors, and I think it's a great recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| We actually brought two policies today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| We brought that one and a fixed asset policy, and I think they're both needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2239)|
| 0:37:24| You will see us bringing more financial policies in the future because those things need to be put in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2244)|
| 0:37:32| I actually had a conversation with Andrea, our new internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| and she was excited that we're coming up with written policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| I think I see your concern, but we can always address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| Yeah, and it's minor, but I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Glad you're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| As Commissioner Shouse referred to, and it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| We're going to get hit with the teachers didn't get it right because we didn't appropriate the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| Number one, we cannot appropriate from the fund balance for continuing expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| It has to be a one-time deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| So it would be illegal at this point for us to take money from the fund balance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| My challenge to them an hour ago was they got fat in that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Let them find it in there like our other departments do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| I just want to be sure that folks know that we cannot use our fund balance for recurring expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2307)|
| 0:38:41| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Mr. Chairman, Chris, I want to make sure that I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| because he brought up the point saying that the teachers are not getting a raise if we don't appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| Well, the teachers are, because I asked Dr. McIntyre this directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| They are getting a raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| It's going to be a step increase that is built in, and he mentioned a figure of four to six hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2334)|
| 0:39:00| So they are getting more money, whether you call it a step increase or a raise or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| Even if the two and a half percent is not approved by this body, they're still getting more money in their paycheck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| In reviewing the school budget, which I have reviewed, there is a step increase in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2354)|
| 0:39:23| and also a .7 percent increase on their end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| And so basically what they're asking from the commission to come from fund balance would be the 1.8 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2368)|
| 0:39:36| which would get you to two and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| So there is a .7 percent raise and a step raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| And that's already included in their budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| So anyway, I just want to make that clear that, you know, to say that there is a raise in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2386)|
| 0:39:50| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Commissioner Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| I just wanted to point out that, yes, they are getting a raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| but, you know, $400 once you take taxes and everything out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| that doesn't even buy groceries for my family for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| So, you know, there are raises and then there are raises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| So I think to call that a raise is insulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Thanks, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Chris, I was wondering if you could interpret some of those numbers again that we went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2420)|
| 0:40:31| Did you get the part when McIntyre said the 2.5 percent is $6 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| Did you hear that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| Here's an easy way to remember this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| A 1 percent raise for the schools is basically 2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2445)|
| 0:40:52| So basically a 2.5 percent raise would be 6.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| And so keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| And so the .7 percent raise that's built into the budget is probably about 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2458)|
| 0:41:05| I hate doing math at the podium, but probably 1.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| 1.6, 1.7 because then the 1.8 percent that they're asking the county for is 4.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| I dream about this stuff, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Can we stay on topic with the policy here just real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| And then we'll get to other budget items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| I need to sit down with you on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| Any other discussion on the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2497)|
| 0:41:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Okay, item number 33 was deferred until May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| Item number 38 was deferred until May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| Now the ones that have been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| First is a grant, approval of a grant in the amount of $101,250| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| to fund the voting system items for use during 2014 through 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2522)|
| 0:42:10| I'll go ahead and explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| This was a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| Clifford called me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| It's a grant from the state to lease these machines that they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| to carry us through the next presidential election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| So is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2539)|
| 0:42:20| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| The next item that was added is approving purchase from KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2549)|
| 0:42:35| to the Sheriff's Department of the site on Bernard Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Move no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| All right, we have a motion for no recommendation and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2564)|
| 0:42:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| They said they'd get that contract as soon as they sign it tomorrow to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| And then line item transfer, is that what you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| Can we move those without recommendation so we can see them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| All right, we've got a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2580)|
| 0:43:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2585)|
| 0:43:22| Commissioner Hammond, do you want to talk about election today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2602)|
| 0:43:29| I do, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2609)|
| 0:43:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Go ahead with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| The reason I moved this from a resolution to a discussion item is I was talking with Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| and I wanted to make sure that I understood the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| When Cliff came and talked with us last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| he had asked for additional dollars to pay our election workers on election day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| And so I told him I would be happy to do that and to sponsor that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| and that was the intent of my resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2636)|
| 0:43:58| But do we need it for this May election or do we, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| I want to make sure I get my numbers right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| Yeah, I believe in talking to Cliff that there is money within his budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| to cover the increase for the May election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| So I don't think there is anything that would be needed for the May election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| So I just need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2659)|
| 0:44:20| Do you have this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| I think he wanted, and my understanding is he wanted a recommendation from the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| to increase the pay of the poll workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| From a budgetary standpoint, the money is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| So really we don't need to act on anything on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| So I can withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| I don't foresee any reason why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2681)|
| 0:44:43| Or do we need to approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| What exactly do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| I thought that he wanted us, like Chris has said, to recommend the increase in pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| but not necessarily tie a budget number to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| I think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Then he can probably handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Yeah, and that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| Do you want a resolution Monday you think would be appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Yeah, let's do that and just get the correct wording with the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| because we want to help him out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2707)|
| 0:45:08| but I just want to make sure that we're having the correct wording on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| Can you do that, Mike, with Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| Yes, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2713)|
| 0:45:14| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Okay, item number 48 is discussion regarding the joint education committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| Our meeting is scheduled for this Thursday, so I'll have a report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| We will have a report on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS140421?start=2727)|
