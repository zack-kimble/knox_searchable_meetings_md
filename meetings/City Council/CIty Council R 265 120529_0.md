| 0:02:09| For the mayor's report, I just want to remind council that not this weekend, but the next weekend, June 9th through 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=129)|
| 0:02:18| we will be hosting our colleagues from across the state for the Tennessee Municipal League Convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=138)|
| 0:02:25| That is at the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| And if you all are not signed up, I hope you'll check with Ms. Mitchell and get all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| There are several workshops and events that weekend where we can learn more about municipal government and best practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=153)|
| 0:02:43| and also get to know some of our colleagues and peers in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| So I will be there throughout the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| And our staff has partnered, and KTSC has been working actively with our Office of Special Events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| because we are the host of the TML this year, and that kind of rotates around, it's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=176)|
| 0:03:03| So I hope you all will come out and be at some of these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=183)|
| 0:03:07| And as you see, folks from other parts of Tennessee, welcome them to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| We have a lot to show them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| I think that is all I have tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=198)|
| 0:03:20| Yes, thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| I'd just like to announce we have a workshop that's coming up Monday, June 4th at 5.30 in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| So I invite everyone to come down and listen to the deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| Any other council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=220)|

| 0:03:47| And I know the Chair of the Board is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| He will be delivering that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| That's Ms. Ola Blackman-McBride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Well, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Mayor O'Hara and City Council, I want to thank you for this opportunity to present our 2011 annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| But before I briefly highlight the report, I want to recognize a member of the committee that's here with me tonight, Steve Fishel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=244)|
| 0:04:13| And also I would like to recognize the PARCC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| Avis Evan-Reed is the Executive Director, and Lisa Chambers is her Administrative Assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| These are the people who do the day-to-day, and we cannot thank them enough for all they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=265)|
| 0:04:31| Also, I'd like to recognize Thomas Tank Strickland, Director of Community Relations, who is a big support to this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=271)|
| 0:04:41| I want to just acknowledge Rabbi Beth Swartz, who is not present tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| but to acknowledge that at the end of June she is leaving Knoxville to serve another congregation in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=286)|

| 0:05:02| Tonight I am presenting to you the 2011 Annual Report of the Police Advisory and Review Committee, PARCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| prepared in accordance with the City of Knoxville Ordinance Number 0-194-01, which was adopted May the 29th, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=310)|
| 0:05:20| This report is a comparative report of matters addressed by the Police Advisory and Review Committee, PARCC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=320)|
| 0:05:26| and its Executive Directors for the years 2010 and 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| The purpose of PARCC is to strengthen the relationship between the citizens of Knoxville and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| The Executive Director, with the encouragement of the committee, has been proactive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| in meeting with the citizens and neighborhood groups interested in improving KPD's presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| and relationship with them in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Throughout the year, the committee and the Executive Director continue to strive to improve coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=352)|
| 0:05:58| and communication with the Internal Affairs Unit and command structure of the KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=358)|
| 0:06:04| KPD attendance and participation in the quarterly PARCC meetings has been great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=364)|
| 0:06:11| and their willingness to meet with the citizens and address complaints that has been brought up at those committees has been excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=371)|
| 0:06:19| We thank Chief Ross for his support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| Our subcommittees continue to monitor cases where racial profiling might be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| as well as the utilization and effectiveness of KPD audio review equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| As always, the committees welcome any input from the Mayor, the City Council, the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| and the citizens of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| Any concerns or issues raised by the committee will be addressed and responded to appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| We thank you for the opportunity to present the 2011 Annual Report, and if there's any questions, I will address them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=408)|
| 0:06:56| Any questions from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| If not, yes, Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| Yes, I wonder if I could ask you, I was just glancing through part of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| and of the complaints, the largest number was sort of rudeness, courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| Could you just talk a little bit about that and what you found and how that's being worked on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| You're correct that actually this year we had a slight increase, and most of those complaints were centered around rudeness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=437)|
| 0:07:27| As we investigated those complaints and we looked at tape, we looked at the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| and in many cases it was their interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=452)|
| 0:07:34| It was probably more firmness, but that we have seen an increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| and we worked with Chief Ross after they've come in and did presentation for us in terms of how they handled situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| so we are comfortable that it's probably more of interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| but as we review the documentation and the tapes, in many cases we have not found it to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=482)|
| 0:08:03| I want to ask you one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| I know you move the meetings around to different locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| How has your attendance been from the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| We indeed do move the meetings from we try to do each sector of the city so we can have citizens from all over the city attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| It has been fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Some areas are greater than others, but we do advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| We do let them know that we are coming, and we try to select locations that are easy and accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| and within their community, churches, the variety of places to meet the needs of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=511)|
| 0:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=517)|
| 0:08:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=518)|

| 0:08:59| I'm probably going to embarrass him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=539)|

| 0:11:38| Councilman Grieve, Jim York, Finance Director for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=698)|

| 0:11:50| is roughly $2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=710)|

| 0:12:20| I'd just like to take a minute to thank Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| This is my first budget, and for some of you, your first budget as well for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| and I appreciate all of the cooperation and the good questions I hear that you asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| during your budget hearings last week, and I appreciate how the whole process went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| And if you have suggestions on how we can improve it next year, please share that with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| and I look forward to implementing this vision that we have set for the city over the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| 9D is in ordinance to amend the operating budget for fiscal year 2011-2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=774)|
| 0:12:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Yes, I'd like to make a motion to divide the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| the reason being that I still feel pretty uncomfortable about the $10 million that's being pulled out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| so I'd like to make a motion that we divide the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| That's an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| This is an ordinance that is capable of being divided in a number of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| because it deals with a number of different topics, so it frankly might be helpful to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| Do you just want to have one question on the $10 million and then the other question, just two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| one question being the $10 million and then the other question the remainder of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| I'd just like to have the $10 million pulled out separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| That would be an appropriate motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| If you don't mind amending your motion to make it to deal separately with the $10 million as one question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| and the other question being the remainder of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=837)|
| 0:13:59| As soon as you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Is there any ñ whose slide is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=842)|
| 0:14:06| That's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Any discussion on the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| Seeing none, we have ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Well, I would just ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Vice Mayor Pavley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| I guess I would say that I'm comfortable with moving forward as we did on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| It was approved and, I mean, I can see pulling it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=859)|
| 0:14:24| I don't really have a real problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| but I'm comfortable with how this is brought forward and what it's to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=866)|
| 0:14:33| and I plan to support, whether it comes out or not, I plan to support it in whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| I also am comfortable with it as it was originally presented as we passed on the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=883)|
| 0:14:49| There are always questions about spending in any budget, this one or any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| We will have many questions along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| but I do think that separating these two issues is not really something we need to be doing at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=898)|
| 0:15:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| I plan on supporting both parts of this, both split,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| but I think it's, you know, if two of my fellow councilmembers want to have the right to vote on a specific one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| I think they should have that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| So I plan on supporting the motion to separate, and then I'll get to vote against them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| He's too eager, don't you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| You do sound eager about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| So, Councilman Grieve, did you want to make any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| I feel comfortable that by separating this that, because I am in favor of the two of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| but I'm very much concerned about the $10 million, you know, from not only a realistic standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| but also philosophically, and I would just like to go on record as not in favor of the $10 million at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| So the motion and the second is to divide the question for 9-D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| So we're voting just on dividing the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| All in favor of dividing, all in favor of the motion to divide the question say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| So two opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| So that's 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| So the question has been divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| So now is there a motion on the main part, not the $10 million, but the rest of the amendment to the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=984)|
| 0:16:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| So we have a motion and a second to approve all of the amendment except the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| And all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1007)|
| 0:16:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1009)|
| 0:16:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| Is there a motion on the $10 million, which is to put $10 million to take $10 million from the fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1014)|
| 0:17:03| and use that to put to I want to make sure the public knows what we're voting on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| and put that towards paying down on the unfunded pension liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1036)|
| 0:17:17| Discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Well, the reason that I'm opposed to this last time and I'm still opposed to it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| you're taking $10 million, you're putting it in the pension plan, you have no control over how it's invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| And there's no reason to believe in the last 12 months that the stock market is going to gain enough to offset the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1051)|
| 0:17:40| You have two proposals that we're going to be looking at further down the agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| Both in the budget was a $2.6 million expenditure out of reserves for the State Street Garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1064)|
| 0:17:54| and another $2.5 million coming on the name TVA's Garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| So the $10 million has now gone to $14.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1079)|
| 0:18:06| And you heard York talk about how long it would take for us to have enough surplus funds in order to replenish $14.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1086)|
| 0:18:20| It's years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| And cash is king.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| I said it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| I didn't say it to be funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| But I'm telling you, as a business owner and the businesses that have survived this recession have been businesses that have had enough cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1105)|
| 0:18:36| And every one of the failed businesses thought they had enough cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| And only ones that have survived do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| And cash is the most critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| And this is not that critical of a time to be investing when you want to invest in the garage, which I'm supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| But then, again, $10 million for the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| It's not going to fix your problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| There are other opportunities that we can consider that we should consider to strengthen and really reduce our long-term debt on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1136)|
| 0:19:07| There's other ideas besides just capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| There's some other ideas that we'll talk about in coming forward that are positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| They're not all negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| But I strongly disagree with spending $10 million on a pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| I think it's a mistake to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| And I was opposed to it two weeks ago, and I'm opposed to it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| And you're getting ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| It's a fort now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| So if that goes through, and then now we're back to talking about the TVA, which I think would be of the TVA garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| is going to be a lot higher priority as far as jobs in the future of Knoxville than the $10 million pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1174)|
| 0:19:40| It's a big issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| And I think I would encourage everyone to reconsider, you know, what you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| I won't repeat everything that Councilman Wallace had to say because I do agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| The last time that I meant to divide the question the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| things just went so quickly that it really didn't get a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| And so a lot of the things that Councilman Wallace has said I totally agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| But the other thing that I'm concerned about is that we really don't know what's going to happen in the next three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| four and five years in terms of where we're going to get the money in order to help pay for the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1208)|
| 0:20:14| And so I'm concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1214)|
| 0:20:15| And I really think that when we have cash in the bank that we ought to look at it pretty seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| So I do have a concern about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| and a concern especially moving forward in terms of where we're going to get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| In other words, what are we looking at in the next couple of years in terms of our cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| So that's a concern that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| If I could have Mr. York come down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1237)|
| 0:20:46| I've got just a couple of questions, and I think this pretty well states my position on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1246)|
| 0:20:52| But from a standard practice, what is the acceptable amount of rainy day fund, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| to have on hand to meet the standard, if you will?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| Well, the city has adopted, formally adopted policies that we will have in the general fund at least 20 percent fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1264)|
| 0:21:14| So 20 percent of our annual operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1274)|
| 0:21:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| That would put it somewhere around 36 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| We have unofficial that we'd like to maintain at least 25 percent at a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| That pushes it up to about $44 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| Currently, we are in the range and, again, absent this action, we are now forecasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1294)|
| 0:21:42| that we're going to be somewhere around 67 million at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| That's after this meeting this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| No, that's prior to this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| You know, if this does, that's going to change the numbers slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| It would probably put us somewhere in the $57 million range, which would still be above our 25 percent threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1317)|
| 0:22:06| We do think that that provides adequate working capital as well as meeting our standards, so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1326)|
| 0:22:14| It has the additional advantage, and, again, this is talking about what we're going to do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| is the way the actuary evaluation works and the way next year's pension contributions are calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1341)|
| 0:22:30| By moving this, we can capture some additional interest possibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| You basically have $10 million that you now can get seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| You can assume seven and three-eighths, you know, over the life of that $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1360)|
| 0:22:47| Now, I can't guarantee you that we're going to get seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| I don't know what the market's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| But from where in terms of funding the pension system, it does have that additional benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| because it's going to affect the contribution rates going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| If you miss the threshold, and, again, the June 30th threshold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| you're now waiting until the budget year 14-15 before you would have an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1391)|
| 0:23:17| So this is a measure that will help reduce debt, save money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| It will reduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| It will have the impact of reducing your future contribution at least in 13-14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| Saving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| And so it's my understanding during all the discussions that we've had in the last six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| that in the way I understood it, the way I walked away from the P-Word meetings is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| we are going to invest in a more conservative manner perhaps than we have before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| And I would assume that this would be a great starting place for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| Well, again, this is part of the pension board is currently evaluating a change in the investment mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1437)|
| 0:24:07| Going to what some people would consider a slightly more conservative or less volatile mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| There is probably a misconception out there that the pension fund has been losing money for numerous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1453)|
| 0:24:21| I've looked at 28 years' worth of data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1461)|
| 0:24:24| There have been four years out of those 28 where we've had actually had negative returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1464)|
| 0:24:30| This year through April, the portfolio had gained 4.4 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Now, that's less than the seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| May, you know, you take a look at May, the first couple of weeks, it's probably down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1478)|
| 0:24:44| I can't tell you where it's going to be at the end of June, and that's really the critical time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| I can tell you that by moving cash into the fund, you do capture some benefit for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1489)|
| 0:24:57| and it's going to help in the preparation of the 13-14 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| Does it affect our bond rating in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| I do not expect that it would have any impact on our bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| I think they would be looking at it as you're exchanging, one, an asset to reduce, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1508)|
| 0:25:14| bonding liability in your pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| And so I think they would look at it favorably as long as we view that we have adequate working capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| and we're meeting our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| Councilman Dalibolti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Jim, as long as you're there, I'll talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| You know, I have listened to you make this presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| and I understand the 6-30-2012 deadline is affecting how you contribute downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| I'm willing to go with your judgment on that with a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| And I raised this as clearly as I could, I guess, at the budget hearings, but I don't see any reaction to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| Is there any way this money can be put into the pension fund with a kind of a condition that it be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1555)|
| 0:26:01| in a conservative investment like a bond or something for six months or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| Because I'll tell you, I'm terribly frightened that Europe is in turmoil, and it has been in turmoil for months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| but it is driving the market down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| There is a great deal of uncertainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| And I think the worst thing we can do is lose this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| And I would like to see the dollars intact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| If there's an advantage of it being on a different ledger sheet in the pension system itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1582)|
| 0:26:29| then I'm willing to go with your recommendation, but only if you'll put a caveat that it be put into the treasuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| or some other instrument that's more secure, at least for six months, so that the air can clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1594)|
| 0:26:41| and that we don't run the risk of running $10 million down into $5 million and wasting taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| Do you have any reaction to sending it with a condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Again, the pension board has an investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| If you look at where we're underneath our targets and over where our targets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1616)|
| 0:27:05| this money would not go into the equity market or the international market either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| because we're currently, if you just look at balancing the portfolio against the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| those are kind of over-weighted at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| Now, again, that's part of the rebalancing that may come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| Practically, this is going to go into cash anyway, just because you can't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| It's probably going to be used to pay ongoing outflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| So instead of selling off investments you'll just take to pay the ongoing pensions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1649)|
| 0:27:35| you'd probably take this cash and then just use that for cash flow purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| in which case it would be in a cash position or a fairly liquid position in terms of a bond fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| And, again, as we indicated a couple of weeks ago, I can't tell you where the market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1668)|
| 0:27:55| I can't tell you where the June 17th Greek elections are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| You know, it's very possible that if one of the parties wins that you may see a sudden uptick in the European markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1679)|
| 0:28:07| Or a sudden downtick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| Well, I think the markets have probably built in the downtick anticipating one party winning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1688)|
| 0:28:15| And the latest polls show that that party is now, you know, on the low end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| But, again, that's two or three weeks away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| But the specific question, you cannot turn it in with a condition that this be additional investment in bonds or something, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1703)|
| 0:28:30| if you'd like to just see it in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| Again, I think you can maybe recommend to the pension board that they keep it in cash and keep it fairly liquid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| If you're the giver, can't you give it with a condition or handle on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| Well, again, you've got to realize that the city puts in money every week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| Right, but this is in addition to the money we put in normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| This is an additional increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| That's a legal question that I can't really address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| I would think that, you know, again, I'm telling you as a practical matter it's going to go into cash anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| I appreciate your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Jim, you say that in the rainy day fund there's, what, 68 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| Well, again, our forecast is that it would be 68 if this did not take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1751)|
| 0:29:19| If this takes place, it will be more in the 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| But isn't there a certain amount of that money that's committed that you, you know, how much is actually set aside for operations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1762)|
| 0:29:31| In terms of operations, the only thing that we have set aside for operations is the 2.6 million that's committed for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1771)|
| 0:29:39| We do use the fund balance to provide operating capital, cash flow, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| Now, when you get it, and, again, this is kind of esoteric accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| but we will designate at least or commit 20 percent of our $36 million roughly, commit 36 million of that fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1790)|
| 0:30:02| We will then take whatever our outstanding encumbrance is and reserve those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| We'll have a little bit in terms of inventory and prepaid assets that we'll have to restrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| But we're probably going to end up, I'm going to say, 18 to 20 million in undesignated and unrestricted fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| And that's – is that less than what you really want to – I know you'd like to have it all, but, I mean, what –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1822)|
| 0:30:30| Oh, you've got that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| But, again, when you – what we do is we take the total fund balance and we start taking our restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| The undesignated piece or the unrestricted piece is the piece that could be used for other things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1840)|
| 0:30:49| And, again, you can use the whole thing for operating capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| But, again, we'd still be well within our targets, well within our policies, undertaking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1852)|
| 0:31:01| Without the $10 million, we're putting in, what, $14.5 million this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| How much money in the pension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| Oh, in terms of the pension, this year it's going to be around – and this year meaning 11-12 – it's going to be around $12.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1867)|
| 0:31:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| What we had budgeted for 12-13 is $14.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| What we are looking at, though, going forward is an additional contribution in 13-14 of potentially another $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| What we are trying to do is to try and lower that bump up next year by putting in some additional capital into the pension fund now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1895)|
| 0:31:45| And, again, capturing that 7-3-8 multiplier, again, going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1905)|
| 0:31:54| So it's kind of a preemptive move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| It's not going to address the entire $7 million, but it will have an impact on that $7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| And, again, you were thinking the impact is going to be how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Well, again, if you just look at the 7-3-8, you've got – on $10 million you're going to capture $730,000 just using that multiplier impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1926)|
| 0:32:22| So, you know, three-quarters of a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| That's at 7-3-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| Again, I –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| And that seems unrealistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| I mean, you can't bank on that you're going to make $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| It's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| It hasn't earned 7-3-8 this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| There's no way you can say that it's going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| Unrestricted – let me – I just want to understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Unrestricted cash reserve stands at $18 to $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1969)|
| 0:32:56| And what we're here tonight, the motion and the two that are going to follow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| we're going to give half – one-half of our unrestricted cash reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| You're going to spend half your unrestricted cash reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| I mean, just think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I mean, that is – it is a bold move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Unrestricted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| You know, unrestricted – again, this changes daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| As of last year, unrestricted was roughly $28 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| If we undertake this, what we're saying is that after the $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| we'll have about $18 million and, you know, $18 to $20 million in unrestricted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| undesignated fund amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| You're only going to spend 30% tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| That's still a big chunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| I mean, I just want you to set the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Jim, reel me in here if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| but I can remember back when, you know, mid-'90s through when I served the last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| and for some reason the number of $17 million in the rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2037)|
| 0:34:05| $17 to $20 million, sticks in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| Is that what we had back in those days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| It's an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| As an average, that's probably a little high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2057)|
| 0:34:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| So it was less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| It was less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| And let me remind everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| I mean, I hear what – I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| And you can spin this either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I could spin it as being a great conservative move, as water tank talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2069)|
| 0:34:35| Man, if I made two payments additional a year on my house payment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| it would come down and it would save me X amount of dollars on my interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| and my payments, and, you know, it's a great thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| Or, as Councilman Wallace and Grieve say, man, we don't know what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| We're throwing money up in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| You know, when we had less money, you know, we grew downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| We made downtown, started and put the seeds into downtown to make it what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| We grew our greenways, our parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| We had safer neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| We had – we increased our uniformed bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| We had no layoffs with less money than what we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| So that's why I'm so comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| And Jim was here, and I have confidence, every bit of confidence in Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| because we all know how conservative Jim is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| and he's not going to let us make a bad mistake here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| So that's why I'm so comfortable with moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| He only gets one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| He only gets one out of seven votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| He doesn't get seven votes in the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| He only has one vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Well, there's two more of us right here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| There's three votes on the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| And I've heard Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I mean, it's very obvious to me as to where he's going with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| And I don't want to debate that, but I'm just saying I've operated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| and seen this city grow and expand at a time when we had –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| and I don't want to say less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| It wasn't that it was the wrong thing to do, but we had a lot less on hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| and we were able to really move this city forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| So I'm just comfortable with where we're at on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| You know, I couldn't agree more with a lot of the things being said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| I mean, this is an extremely painful thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| We're putting a huge portion of our cash reserves into a pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| The 7 and 3-8s is uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| If you've lowered that number – I mean, but I think while we're doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| it's because our pension system is in a big, big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| It's $120 million underfunded, 120.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| We're talking about 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| And if you lower that 7 and 3-8s number, that number grows by hundreds of millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| So this is just an enormous problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| And, of course, I think everybody knows where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| That's why we need to close this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| And if you don't like putting – I don't understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| If you don't like putting money in the stock market now, why do you want to create a new plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Why do we want to create a new plan where we're putting more money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2231)|
| 0:37:15| where we continue to put money in the stock market for this hybrid plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2235)|
| 0:37:20| So I would just say, I mean, I think it's a prudent move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| It's taking an asset to reduce an off-balance sheet liability is the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| But, you know, to me, it hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| I mean, for anybody that loves this city and everything this city needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| to put $10 million into this fund hurts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| And that's why I think it would be easy that we should just close the current plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| and go to something where the city is not in the stock market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2264)|
| 0:37:50| That's a defined contribution plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Yes, I think everybody does know where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| I am for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| I look at this as an incremental step that we need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| Yes, it's painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2285)|
| 0:38:06| And I think there will be some other steps that will be equally or perhaps more painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| But we need to begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| We really need to address this, not only as we've tried to address it in our workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2292)|
| 0:38:18| and we'll address again perhaps next Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| but we need to begin to really put our money down and begin to pay this thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| This is a start, and that's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| But I am going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| I agree with Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| A great deal of respect for the three people in this room who are on the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| I think the pension board, one time someone said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| sometimes you need that two before between the eyes to get people's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| And I'm pretty sure that we all have had that two before between the eyes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| whether we're on the pension board or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| So I would really think that this is a move which I intend to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| And my thrill, I never like to spend any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| My husband will testify to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| I don't like to go shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I don't like to spend money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| But sometimes you have to spend money to be in a safer position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| So that's why I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| Okay, we have a motion and a second on the $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2361)|

| 0:39:27| How many, four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| I didn't vote, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| I abstained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| I was sitting there listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Let's do a roll call just to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2379)|

| 0:39:43| Councilman Dela Volpe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Reluctantly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2391)|

| 0:39:54| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2394)|

| 0:39:58| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Passes seven to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| Okay, thank you, councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| So we're now on to 9E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| 9E is an ordinance changing the date of the regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| beer board and city council meetings from December 25, 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| to December 20, 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2425)|
| 0:40:26| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| 9F is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2428)|
| 0:40:32| zoning regulations, Article II definitions, and Article IV,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| Section 3.12 TC1 to change provisions regarding permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| uses and other related ordinance provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2444)|
| 0:40:45| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2445)|
| 0:40:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2446)|
| 0:40:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| We have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Councilman Dela Volpe or comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| I think I understand this, but I see Mark Donaldson down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Mark, we are drifting a little further away from the town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| regulations we started with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| but it seems like MPC thought that this was probably a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| flexibility and wanted to go this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| Do you have any comments about what we're doing and why it's a good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| Yeah, these are two or three amendments that we proposed in a much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2471)|
| 0:41:17| bigger package more than a year ago when the new ownership took over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| at North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| And we have a particular developer on a small part of the project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| is interested in a medical clinic on a first floor and the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| code for some reason prohibited that in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| So these are all amendments that we think make sense and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| in fact, provide more flexibility to the developer over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| So you try it out with this original design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| and then you find out that there's a few kinks and you're just adjusting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| to deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2515)|
| 0:41:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| We're adjusting one use and a square footage number and then providing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| an alternative compliance path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2530)|
| 0:42:11| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2531)|
| 0:42:12| 9G is an ordinance to approve and adopt the fiscal year 2013-2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| Knoxville Capital Improvement Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| including the FY2013 Capital Improvement Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Councilman Dallivolpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Yes, I just have, I guess, a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2546)|
| 0:42:28| I was reading the preamble and all the text about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| and it seems like if we don't amend this now to put in the TVA garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| we can't spend the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| I don't understand how we can have a capital budget that doesn't have an item in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| that we can then act on the later item in this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2564)|
| 0:42:47| And I think we need to amend it somehow to put in for the fiscal year 2013 capital budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2567)|
| 0:42:54| that $2.5 or $2.7 million we're going to be talking about in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| But the way this reads to me that you need a two-thirds vote of council later to change it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2579)|
| 0:43:05| if you're even going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| But ideally, nothing comes out of the capital improvements program for the current year budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| without it being written in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Maybe Jim York can enlighten me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| But it sounds like we ought to amend this to add that and then approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2598)|
| 0:43:26| You're correct in that if something is not in the capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| then it would take a two-thirds vote to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| And, again, I don't know whether we have an existing capital project that this could fall under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| If you want to be on the safe side, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| I don't see an issue in amending that and we'll place it in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| It would just be a safe, kind of a safe harbor if you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| Well, I guess I would move to amend the capital improvement program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| and specifically the capital improvement budget for 2013 to have as an additional project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| a proposed garage that we want to build in connection with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2645)|
| 0:44:11| excuse me, at least help build with TVA by providing the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| And I don't know whether we have a specific number we could put in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| or how we have to do this, but I would, maybe I'll get Mr. Swanson's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| I just think it ought to be included before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Just trying to think my way through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| How about an amendment to include the purchase of property for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| Which is part of what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| To purchase options and property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| Is it $2.7 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| In the area where it is anticipated that a summer place garage will go in the amount of $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| I could go ahead and do the presentation now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| That would be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Well, we just right now we just need to amend the capital budget to include this as a purchase of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2694)|
| 0:45:00| as a part of the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| For the proposed TVA garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| For the proposed TVA garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| What's the number we should put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| Here's what I would suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| Because, again, as we come back, is that you amend it in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| just in one of the out years to add a category called downtown parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| And leave it fairly broad based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| Would you use 2.7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| I would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| You can use 2.7, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| And then we'll come back and we'll amend the capital budget once we get everything tied down and very specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| I move that we amend the capital budget to include an item called downtown garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| Downtown parking in or about summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| For an amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Are we adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2750)|
| 0:45:51| Well, I don't think you need to put an amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| I think you could just leave it kind of broad and let us fill in the blanks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2754)|
| 0:46:01| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| This doesn't mean it's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| It's just putting it in the budget as an activity we can act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| So the motion is to amend the capital improvement budget to add downtown parking as. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| You're amending the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| Amending the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Plan or program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| To include a category for downtown parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| With no dollar amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I'll add an approximate amount of $2.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Just an approximate amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Again, what you're doing will, you know, you're going to have a discussion later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| In terms of the capital budget, we'll have to come back once we get everything tied back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| and we'll come back with very specific recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| And you can amend the budget at that time, you know, should you choose to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| What this does is it just kind of gives you a little broad base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| so you don't have to go back and amend the plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| It's coming out of reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| Both the garages are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| So $2.7 million, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| And the one that's already in here, the State Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| Do you understand that voting on this would not approve the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| It would simply say that it's within the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| Once you're on the slippery slope, Nick, once you've approved it in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| I mean, if you don't discuss it now, I would even make a motion that you suspend the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| Let's go to hear Christy's presentation and come back to it if you're going to put it in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| I think you need to know what, because I don't know other than a two-minute conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| what this is about other than what I've read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| But by adding, just by adding the category, you are not committing any dollars or any action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2861)|
| 0:47:48| You're adding the category now, and then later you choose to approve the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| I hear you, but, I mean, just saying, I mean, you're going to, you know, once it's in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2875)|
| 0:47:59| it goes, well, it's already in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2879)|
| 0:48:00| You all have already voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| And it's like, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Because that's, you know, that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Well, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Do we have a second on amending the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| I'm not sure you can do that, Kenny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Do what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| We've already got an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| We've got an amendment on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| I'm going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| I was going to say we have a motion and a second for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Is that correct, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| So now we are voting on the amendment, and then we'll go back and vote on the full item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| which will include that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| So all in favor of the amendment say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| So that amendment passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| And now we'll go back to the original as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2932)|
| 0:48:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| And this will be on 9G as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| State the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| The amendment's already been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| It was what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2943)|
| 0:49:05| Which is to add the downtown parking category to the capital improvement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| No money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| No money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Specifically money committed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2955)|

| 0:49:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Passes eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=2960)|

| 0:51:29| Yeah, I wonder if we could just have maybe engineering or someone just tell us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| this because everyone's obviously interested in both safety and sidewalks and crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| busy roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| So what are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| Just in brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| This is, I'm Jim Hagerman, Engineering Director for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3101)|
| 0:51:48| This is, this project will consist of removing the markings that already existed at 22 intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3108)|
| 0:52:03| refurbish and freshen up the markings and the concentration is on crosswalks and stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3123)|
| 0:52:12| bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| These particular ones that we've chosen for this first contract in this budget item are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| big intersections that require more staff than we have easily accessible to do both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3142)|
| 0:52:30| the work and the traffic control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3150)|
| 0:52:33| We could do one or the other, but not both very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| So that's our, that's our, that's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| We also are just generally running behind on this sort of work, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| But these are going to be now brighter, newer crossing markings so that cars and pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3164)|
| 0:52:49| will know exactly where the activity is and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3173)|

| 0:53:42| If I could get Chief Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| Okay, so just briefly, we had a meeting last week over in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| This is a really unique opportunity for us for what's going on, what will be going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| in Fort Sanders and what have you, and I think we stand a pretty good chance of being a contender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| in this million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Yeah, this gives us a unique opportunity with what's already happening in the Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| Avenue corridor as well as the Fort Sanders area that several people are already working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| on, everything from the city working on the Cumberland Avenue area as well as the hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3254)|
| 0:54:20| working up in the Fort Sanders area on the improvements they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| But it gives us an opportunity to leverage all of that work to really change that community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| and try to move it ahead in terms of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| And the first year of the grant, if we get it, will provide us $150,000 of training and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| technical assistance to look at the area and determine, study the area with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3281)|
| 0:54:47| at UT and determine what could work to change it and to make it a sustainable change in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3287)|
| 0:54:55| the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| And then we submit plans on how we would spend the $850,000 remaining for the following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3296)|
| 0:55:02| two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| And so it's a very unique opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| It's a great opportunity, but it's very competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3306)|
| 0:55:09| Only six grants will be awarded, but we think we have a great chance because of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| that's already being done in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| And two, I mean, if you would talk about, I mean, it's just not the whole Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3320)|
| 0:55:21| It's a very concentrated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| It is a very concentrated part of Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Basically from 19th Street to 11th and from just almost to Cumberland to Grand on up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3325)|
| 0:55:34| streets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3334)|
| 0:55:35| So it's a very concentrated area where we've noticed percentage-wise there's some, as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3335)|
| 0:55:41| tell folks, Fort Sanders is a safe area, but we can do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| And this would provide us an opportunity to really make some aesthetic changes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| neighborhood, which will improve the safety of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| Some things that, of course, the study would tell us specifically what's needed, but, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| know, there are opinions, you know, things like lighting and, you know, possible surveillance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| and things like that that could be added on with this money, as well as blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| that could be improved, which is another big part of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| I like the sound of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Yes, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| Do you have any idea if you get this grant, when it would be awarded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Do you have any idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| It's an immediate turnaround, so the award would come very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| So we would start the first year of the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Usually the way the federal government works, somewhere around October is where we'd start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3393)|
| 0:56:38| And so then that first year of funding would be October to October, and then we'd turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| around the following two years after that, being able to make the other implementations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3403)|
| 0:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3408)|

| 0:57:25| I wonder if Chief Roush knows if you have this in your budget, the match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| to obtain options and, if deemed appropriate following due diligence, to purchase property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| generally bounded on the northwest side by Summer Place in the northeast of Walnut Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| and the southwest by Locust Street and on the southeast by existing parking and to convey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| said property to the Tennessee Valley Authority for the development of a parking garage for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| the cost to the City of $226,500 for purchasing said options, $2.5 million for the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| acquiring said property, and with TVA to provide public parking spaces within said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| parking garage at no cost to the City of Knoxville as consideration for the conveyance of said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Would you all like to hear from Christy first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| Okay, Christy Branscom, who is our Senior Director of Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| I do have a sitemap here, and I'd like to distribute these to give you a little better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3511)|
| 0:58:34| idea of exactly the property that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3514)|
| 0:59:04| This is a little bit easier to see what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3544)|
| 0:59:19| For some time now, TVA has expressed a need for additional parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3559)|
| 0:59:25| The City has also experienced a need for additional parking in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| This need has been expressed from several different business entities and private citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| and in the most recent years, as downtown has grown both residentially and commercially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| and with the increased programming of special events, this need has become even more prevalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| In early 2012, conversations began between TVA and the City regarding whether these two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3583)|
| 0:59:48| entities could find an opportunity to work together to get both of their parking needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| The City Administration was aware of the possibility that there may be property available located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| at Summer Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Wood Properties had some portion of the property under option located at the corner of Locust| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| Street and Summer Place, but did not have all of the property that would be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| for a garage under option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| The City negotiated with Wood Properties to pursue optioning the property located at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| corner of Summer Place and Walnut Street in its commonly known to us as Liberty Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| which some of you may be more familiar with that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Wood Properties was able to secure all options for the property sufficient for the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| of the garage and agreed to assign those options to the City of Knoxville for a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3627)|
| 1:00:31| of $215,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| The City staff met with TVA again and presented the site, and both parties found the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| to be suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| TVA and the City then agreed to work on a memorandum of understanding between the parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| where the City would provide the property and TVA would actually build the garage, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| would consist of 800 to 1,000 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| After negotiations between the parties, the final draft of the MOU was sent to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3651)|
| 1:00:57| The City Council has also provided three options for the properties that are under option and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3657)|
| 1:01:02| needed for the garage, and also the assignment agreement for those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3662)|
| 1:01:07| As you will see, or you may have already reviewed, this garage would be made available for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| parking from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Excuse me, that would be Friday until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| All federal holidays and on weekends from 6 p.m. in the evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| I'm sorry, that would be every day after work, 6 p.m. on Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| All federal holidays and weekends, 6 p.m. Friday to 6 a.m. on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| This availability would be achieved by recording of a restrictive covenant that would run with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| the property to ensure that the garage would continue to be made available in this manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| for public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| So that's where we are, and you guys do have a memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Christy, this is an exciting opportunity on its face, at least, that we're going to partner with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| They're going to take the lion's share of the obligation to build a parking garage so they can use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| for their employees or their building if they wanted to do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| And we still get the benefit by partnering with them for nights and weekends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| and that's been one of the ways that downtown's really been successful is to have accessible parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| I guess I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| One, I didn't have a chance to read the memorandum of understanding since it was just given out before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| but is there a possibility that TVA could renege on the building after we gave them the deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3756)|
| 1:02:43| or does it revert back to us if they don't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| How do we protect ourselves in that unlikely but possible situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| The legal department did work with us on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| We tried to present the memorandum as quickly as it was done, which is a little bit after lunchtime today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3773)|
| 1:02:58| so sorry it was late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| There is a paragraph in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| I believe it's, is it paragraph 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3783)|
| 1:03:04| And if you refer to that paragraph in there, it explains that if TVA were to terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| and the city performed all of its obligations under the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| that we would be able to get reimbursement, which they're calling recovery cost, up to $3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3792)|
| 1:03:18| So we've protected our investment, in a sense, by having that provision in the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3798)|
| 1:03:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| And then it says we're going to have it shovel-ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Does that mean we're going to knock it down and get it ready for them to start building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| or what does shovel-ready mean in this context in this document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3810)|
| 1:03:35| Shovel-ready would require for us to demolish the Liberty Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| Some of you, I'm sure, are familiar with that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3819)|
| 1:03:41| It's been boarded up for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| There's also property adjacent to it that would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| It's under this option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| For the parking garage, it's a big hole right now, for lack of a better description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| It was already cleared of the building that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Yes, it has been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| It would just be required that the Liberty Building would have to be demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Do you feel comfortable that shovel-ready can be done within the budget that you have outlined here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3838)|
| 1:04:03| or the amount you've outlined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| Well, the budget that we have right now is the $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| Is that pure acquisition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Here's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3853)|
| 1:04:14| Maybe this will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| It's $2.5 million for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| It's $11,500 for the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3858)|
| 1:04:22| The options would obviously be credited should we decide to exercise those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3862)|
| 1:04:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Go towards the purchase price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| We also estimated $25,000 in some due diligence work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3870)|
| 1:04:39| I'm trying to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Is that title searching, or what is the due diligence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| It is geotechnical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Testing, drilling, and testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| Right, right, to make sure that the property is suitable for a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| Geotechnical testing, phase one, phase two if it's warranted, and then also a survey on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3888)|
| 1:04:56| Do you need additional monies to knock down the Liberty Building or whatever it's called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| We would need additional monies to knock down the Liberty Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| Do you have a sense of what that would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| I think at a minimum it's going to be a couple hundred thousand dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| but I don't think there is any way to say at this point definitively what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| I guess the last thing is I've seen some public comments to the effect of or maybe they're businessman comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3912)|
| 1:05:19| Is there any way to have retail along the retail corridor or some kind of shops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3919)|
| 1:05:24| I don't know how we can tell TVA to get in the retail business or the leasing business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| but I was just curious, did you address that in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| We talked about it quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| If you refer to paragraph 3Eiii, it says TVA has agreed to seek input from the city in developing the design of the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3935)|
| 1:05:44| and includes streetscape improvements consistent with downtown design review guidelines at TVA's reasonable discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| So the city has been invited to have a seat at the table, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| and the city and TVA have discussed the downtown design review guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| TVA has expressed to me that that is their intent to design a garage that is aesthetically pleasing as the Market Square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| or Locust Street garages, but honestly, it's probably best to allow TVA to elaborate on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| and they're actually here this evening if you would like to ask them that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3970)|
| 1:06:15| If they're willing to step to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3975)|
| 1:06:17| I mean, this is a really exciting project for the city and I assume for TVA as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| because they're hemmed in where they're sitting and the parking would help them fill those buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| or lease space that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| Keep in mind it's not been designed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| It's very, very preliminary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| We're just talking about working together, and it's an exciting project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| but could you tell us a little bit about that and your approach to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=3995)|
| 1:06:40| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4000)|
| 1:06:41| Madam Mayor, members of Council, I'm Burt Robinson with TVA's 1716 Dancing Light Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| Glad to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| It is exciting for us as well, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I think it's probably most appropriate for your question to be answered by our Vice President of Property and Natural Resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4011)|
| 1:06:59| Mr. Bruce Schofield, who's joined us tonight, so I'll call Bruce up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4019)|
| 1:07:08| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| And if you will repeat the question so I am certain I'm answering exactly what you wanted to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| Well, I guess at this point I was wondering, you're still looking at the design, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| You're just now getting into the memorandum of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Is there a possibility that you would have some space along the commercial corridor that might have leaseable shops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4044)|
| 1:07:31| or are you thinking just pure parking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| I've seen the comment made and I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| And at this time we're looking at pure parking because TVA is not in the management of retail space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4056)|
| 1:07:45| It's not part of our core business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4065)|
| 1:07:48| What we want to do is provide parking that is in combination with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4068)|
| 1:07:55| The city gets a mutual use out of it, as we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| One of the things that we have had difficulties with in finding tenants for the East Tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4079)|
| 1:08:05| and that's about 800 jobs that will be in the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| That makes that very leaseable or saleable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| We've always run into where are we going to park whenever we talk to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| So our primary intent is to build a parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4097)|
| 1:08:20| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| And, of course, we're a pioneer town on a hillside and we need every little piece of parking we can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| We're glad to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4110)|
| 1:08:31| It's also my understanding that TVA will manage the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| Yes, it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Once the property is transferred to TVA in fee, it will become federal property and TVA will own and operate the garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4116)|
| 1:08:45| Yeah, I'm like Councilman Dellavopia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| I'm really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| I think having 800 more jobs downtown is a real plus, and I'm sure TVA will be glad to lease the building on that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4128)|
| 1:08:55| Christy, I was going to ask that one of the things that whether or not it might be considered as you look into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| and especially as you look at the design is whether or not there's a possibility of joining the garages with a crossover or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4140)|
| 1:09:07| you know, the new garage with the other garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| It might be something to take a look at so that people parking in that garage can be undercover,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| at least part of the way to Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| So I might consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| As I said, TVA has been kind enough to make sure that the city has a seat at the table in the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| so I'll certainly remember that and keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| Yes, I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| Under your memorandum 3E, I guess I through X, page 5, what do you estimate all those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4171)|
| 1:09:40| The city hereby will undertake the following, the sole cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| Do you have a total estimate for all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| Could you point that out again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Page 3, did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4189)|
| 1:09:50| Page 5, under E, 3E, I, however you got it, 1 through 10, 1 through 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4190)|
| 1:09:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| The city hereby agrees to undertake each of the following, city shall acquire, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Do you have a total for what that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Well, we obviously know what the purchase of the property would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4206)|
| 1:10:10| We have the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| I estimated the survey at $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4212)|
| 1:10:16| Broker fee was $215,000, and I negotiated that with Wood Properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4216)|
| 1:10:23| Geotechnical, I think it's going to probably be $3,000 to $5,000 to do some core drillings on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4223)|
| 1:10:31| And the demolition of the improvements, as I said, I think it's probably a minimum of a couple hundred thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| I do know that demolition prices have come in quite a bit better than what we've seen in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| simply because there's a lot of heavy equipment sitting around not being used right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| There aren't really no utility or infrastructure changes that are required at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Something may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Of course, we can convey title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| We have no zoning changes that are required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| And then, as I mentioned previously, we would want to do a Phase 1 and a Phase 2 if the Phase 2 is warranted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| which I imagine that it is with that older building on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4263)|
| 1:11:07| So I imagine that's probably going to be a total of no more than $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| So I think the total ended up being about $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4272)|
| 1:11:16| For Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| I think it's going to be a good project going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| I think it will be a win-win for the city and for TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| And I'm wondering, Christy, with the State Street improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4295)|
| 1:11:42| will this bring our parking up to adequate in terms of our downtown events and our weekends?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| I think we'll be in pretty good shape, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| I would think so, but I think it would probably be good to get Bill Lyons to maybe address State Street in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| because I know that particular garage is going to help most of the people on that end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4318)|
| 1:12:03| I think there's some additional development that's on that side of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| and this garage will be on the other end of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| But I think it's going to go a long way, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Mayor Brown, I could address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| We have pretty extreme parking needs in both of those areas, the north side with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| and what the building known as the Kimberly Clark Building right now have been very much in need of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4343)|
| 1:12:29| The Market Square garage is pretty fully subscribed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| And then the State Street will then service the area of Gay Street around that garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4352)|
| 1:12:38| and around Tennessee Theater and behind Farragut Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| There are an awful lot of folks looking to invest a lot of money into some major projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| who are really counting on parking over in the State Street area that that will provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| I would also add that one of the things we heard from a number of council people early| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4373)|
| 1:12:57| in reasonably close succession that Kimberly Clark was going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| and then there was a resource recovery group on Gay Street that was leaving because of parking concerns as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| So this really gives resources that I think are you never ---- it would be a real high-class problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| if in not too long we needed more parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| That can only happen by a phenomenal, you know, number of jobs going to town and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| But I think this ---- the beauty of this project is with, you know, by working with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| that it takes the pressure off our other garages by providing this capacity that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| I guess the quick answer is that both of these garages should in the foreseeable future put us in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| Even though it's a parking garage, it's going to make the area look better, and that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| I would echo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| I mean, it's very exciting, and I would certainly commend the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| and working and really leveraging tax dollars to bring something good to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| My big concern was also with the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| And just so I understand, if a private entity bought this land and built a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4439)|
| 1:14:07| it would be subject to the Downtown Design Review Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4447)|
| 1:14:13| Yes, it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| And there's also a comment in here regarding agencies, state and federal agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4454)|
| 1:14:20| And what it says is that the duties of the board members would be to encourage other governments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4460)|
| 1:14:26| state and federal agencies, to participate in creating positive design improvements downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| And that's how it addresses government agencies in the Downtown Design Review Guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4472)|
| 1:14:39| And I feel comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| Did you have anything to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| I think your point is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| If it were a private garage, that would come before the Downtown Design Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| But I might add, there's much context involved in that board and its deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| I think even were it a private garage, the great difficulty in getting retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| you can't just manufacture a demand in a location where it's very problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| I'm not sure what the ultimate outcome would be, but the design would go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| and the arguments would go to the Downtown Review Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| And the guidelines are there that would definitely have to be addressed at the very least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4508)|
| 1:15:13| not commenting on what the final outcome would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Well, I mean, just for me, for a fairness standpoint, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| if a private industry was building this garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4521)|
| 1:15:23| and they have to go through these Downtown Review Guidelines, which we set up, then, you know, an entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4523)|
| 1:15:30| I mean, in this situation, we're buying land, we're taking it off the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4530)|
| 1:15:36| and we're giving it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| So it's costing millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| There's going to be no more taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| To me, I don't think it would be too much to ask just to make sure that the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4543)|
| 1:15:49| to ask them to go through the Downtown Design Review Board and through those guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4549)|
| 1:15:56| I would like to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| I think the probability of any private entity coming and building a garage approaches zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| That's part of the reason we're engaged in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| I mean, garages have been in the public sphere, but I think that's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| The distinction between private and public on projects like this is exactly why those distinctions are made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| In the Downtown Design Review process, we were engaged in a very long discussion, a very big public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| where just these kinds of questions were addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| and that's part of the reason we ended up drawing that distinction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| that there was a difference between a public project and a private project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| And also, of course, we're not in the business of being able to regulate the state and federal governments also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| I think TVA pays more taxes, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Yeah, I mean, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| I mean, but in this situation where we're partners, we have some leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4604)|
| 1:16:49| You know, if TVA just bought this land and they wanted to build a garage, then we wouldn't have anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| They wouldn't be subject to the downtown guides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| But, I mean, I would like to make a motion, and it might fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4617)|
| 1:17:01| but that the garage be subject to the downtown guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4621)|
| 1:17:10| Well, I could say you only have leverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I mean, both parties are voluntarily here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| and I think when you heard the TVA folks present their perspective on this, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4636)|
| 1:17:21| so I think one has to be applying leverage isn't a one-way street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| I think it's highly risky to start building in, quote, unquote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| leverage to processes that involve a negotiated settlement between two entities on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| And it is subject to the downtown design review guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| It shows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| As a federal state and federal agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| we are encouraging them to participate in creating positive design improvements downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4661)|
| 1:17:50| Well, is there a difference between, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| I just want them, this building, to go through the same process a private developer would have to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| or a private entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| If there's not a difference, then, I mean, I'm wasting all of our time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4680)|
| 1:18:04| but my understanding was there was a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4684)|
| 1:18:09| Let me try and see if I can clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| The downtown design guidelines create standards for government agencies and for private agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| because they recognize that there are differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| The guidelines are also, they're not strict requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| but they are called guidelines because it is a goal to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| and it encourages best practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| The downtown design review board considers the plans that are submitted to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| and it's always going to consider a government-owned building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| or property differently than the privately owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| So what you're asking is that even though the design guidelines specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4726)|
| 1:18:53| already address how a government-owned property would be treated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| you're asking that that be a higher standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4738)|
| 1:19:01| and be what would be required of a private-owned building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| So when Chrissy says that the design guidelines already cover it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| they cover it as a federal entity, not as a privately-owned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4750)|
| 1:19:14| So you're actually kind of raising what the design guidelines already set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| That's what your request seems to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| Well, and I guess it's my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| I mean, this has sort of come across us rapidly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| and I'm not familiar enough with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| I certainly don't know if retail or office would make sense there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| and a lot of other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| but I know that that board is there for that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| to make sure we don't have ugly buildings downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4781)|
| 1:19:44| And so that's all I'm trying to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4784)|
| 1:19:47| Again, I think this is a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| What I said before, great leverage of tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| And my understanding, typically design does not kill deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| Maybe in this sense it would kill the deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| but that's sort of my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| Design, usually that can be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| So that's why I've made my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4809)|
| 1:20:14| that I think it should have to comply just like a private entity would for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4814)|
| 1:20:26| There is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4826)|
| 1:20:27| Is there a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Yeah, I would just like to say to Ms. Branson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| just be sure and take this opportunity to be able to advance infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| such as high-speed Internet, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| I mean, that may be part of the process that you all go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| but I know in a previous life when I was at Comcast we were able to strike a deal with TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| where we brought our cable plant through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| and was able to access parts, if not all, of markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| It's been a lot of years now, but Market Square Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| a lot of different markets where you can't call it mall anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| But just take the opportunity to see, and as Councilman Grief said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4864)|
| 1:21:10| even if we connected them, you can go overhead with Conduit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| and just bring high-speed Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| I think it's a big issue for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| Absolutely, and I think TVA has some green incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| that they have also considered for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| So hopefully one day when we get all this designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| we'll be able to come back and talk about some of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| and in particular the green incentives that they will present with this design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| Okay, I think Councilman Grave is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| I'm sorry, I'll work my way around everybody again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| This is probably not all that important now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| but I just thought maybe for the general public you ought to explain a Phase I and Phase II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| that you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Sure, the Phase I is a Phase I environmental assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| If the Phase I, if there's anything detected in there that they feel like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| or determine needs further investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4920)|
| 1:22:03| then they'll recommend a Phase II environmental assessment be performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4923)|
| 1:22:11| Councilman Gallivaldi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| Yeah, I was just going to say I don't mind tickling a horse so it will open its mouth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| and see if it has teeth, but I really don't want the dentist to get in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| I mean, the gift horse is here, and I think this is a great, great partnership between two entities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4939)|
| 1:22:25| and I think there's a lot of goodwill from TVA that they will work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| and I think we should leave it unencumbered at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| I'm glad that was recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| That'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4955)|
| 1:22:36| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4956)|
| 1:22:37| Mine's just very moderate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| I know you have parking restrictions in this building because it's government-owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| Does it being federally owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| is that going to create some parking issues that you all thought about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| or you'd have to work through restrictions to hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| You know, TVA is probably best to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| I did ask about, you know, would it ever be possible to do residential development, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| on top of this garage, and because it's a federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| and because of, I guess, I think it's home security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4988)|
| 1:23:12| Not home security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| Homeland security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| Because of those issues, you know, that's not an option here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| Don't bring your gun in their garage, is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5002)|
| 1:23:23| Don't bring your gun in their garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| That's why I'm just wondering about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| Are there going to be, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| You've got a lot of restrictions here in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| I just didn't know if that was going to pass along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| And we're on the, again, in the initial stages of this review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| We haven't seen any that would cause those type of restrictions any more than you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5016)|
| 1:23:42| in any other public parking facility to go do that for restrictions and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| To go do that, we'll just make sure that it's a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| A bunch of lights went off, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5033)|

| 1:24:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5095)|
| 1:24:56| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5096)|
| 1:24:57| We do have some lights on, and we have a speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| Would you like to hear from the speaker first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5101)|
| 1:25:02| Mr. Seymour, would you please state your name and address, and you will have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| Mr. Mayor, Members of Council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| I am here on behalf of the owners of the Cumberland House Hotel on 11th Street at White Avenue, which is four points by Sheridan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5114)|
| 1:25:25| We had this discussion several months ago when this initially came up before city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| and we had a discussion about it at the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| I have submitted a letter to Members of Council and to Mr. Wetzel today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| I would have done it yesterday, but I realized when I got to my office yesterday it was a holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5142)|
| 1:25:48| I would like to file this with Ms. Mitchell as part of the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5148)|
| 1:25:56| Basically, we did not receive any kind of municipal subsidy, federal subsidy, or any kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| My client built the Cumberland House Hotel in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5164)|
| 1:26:10| We are asking to play on a level playing field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| The questionnaire submitted to the applicant here says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| Is this a historical structure on the National Register? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5179)|
| 1:26:24| Is this in a proposed or actual redevelopment area? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| Is this a brownfield site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| And he answered no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| And all of those were truthful answers to the questions submitted by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5193)|
| 1:26:39| We submit that the applicant meets none of the requirements that have been used in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5199)|
| 1:26:45| to determine whether or not he is eligible for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| Therefore, we would argue and ask you to deny the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5210)|
| 1:26:58| Because of what happened at the Industrial Development Board, since the property is not in a redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5218)|
| 1:27:05| it is not in the Central Business Improvement District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| It is argued that it is in the Central City area of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5229)|
| 1:27:18| I carried newspapers over there several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5238)|
| 1:27:22| That was not the Central City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| That was West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| That was Lake Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5246)|
| 1:27:27| I grew up a block and a half from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| There were homes right where the proposed hotel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| If I had my book here, I could tell you who lived in each one and how timely they paid the paperboy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5255)|
| 1:27:41| But that was not part of the Central City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| It never has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| The Central City started east of the University of Tennessee and always has and does today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5265)|
| 1:27:51| And this is recognized by the boundaries of the Central Business Improvement District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| which this council delineated a number of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5276)|
| 1:28:03| But we think the hotel business is competitive in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5283)|
| 1:28:08| There are two new hotels, one under actual construction on Paper Mill, I believe, right beyond North Shore on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5288)|
| 1:28:17| I think that's going to be a Holiday Inn Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5297)|
| 1:28:21| There is one going down at the Paper Mill Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5301)|
| 1:28:26| I believe Mr. Barnett's development down there, he has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Neither of those hotels are eligible for any kind of public assistance and yet are getting done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5311)|
| 1:28:39| I submit what happened here is that the applicant simply overpaid for the property, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5319)|
| 1:28:47| The people I've had analyze it were people who were actually looking at the property and refused to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| although they had the opportunity because the price was too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| So what he is now asking the city to do is to bail him out by giving him a pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| letting him obtain his operating expenses at the expense of the city and county taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5345)|
| 1:29:14| Sir, Mr. Seymour, you have one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5356)|
| 1:29:17| So on that basis, we would ask you to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| My client, of course, would prefer not to have any competition at all, but he has plenty of competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| He has the Holiday Inn, which is newly renovated, Mr. Knight's Hotel, the Crown Plaza over here, the Hilton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5367)|
| 1:29:36| which is newly renovated, the Hampton Inn, and the Marriott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| But he will deal with competition that starts out at the same place he does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5380)|
| 1:29:46| and therefore we ask that this be denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| Mr. Knight, did you also want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| You're standing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5393)|
| 1:29:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| Well, you know, I'm not going to belabor this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| You know, we debated it or discussed it, you know, a couple of months ago, whenever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| I mean, I'd like to have Mr. Wetzel kind of address the, you know, what it does from the tax standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5410)|
| 1:30:18| And, I mean, I think Mr. Seymour might have maybe left out a point or two in his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| Well, certainly try to help you answer those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| I apologize we're back here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| There was a technicality that we missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| This had to be designated central city area, clearly Lake Avenue since at least 1964.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| And city annexations has been a part of Knoxville-Citrus City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| and the Yale Avenue redevelopment plan that was executed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5440)|
| 1:30:43| There's been a lot of changes in the last, you know, half century in that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| Anyway, that's what we have to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| That's the issue that came up in front of the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| Currently, we're receiving $20,000, well, right at $25,000 in taxes from that property in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5452)|
| 1:31:01| And this will jump the taxes up into more to the $3 million range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| I don't have those numbers right here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| because I thought we'd be talking more about the center city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| But we're bumping a blighted property several million dollars in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| And for five years, it stays with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| So there's no investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| There's no investment from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| The city of Knoxville and the taxpayers write no checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| And, you know, I would like to say, I mean, we've got a tremendous amount of investment going on on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5487)|
| 1:31:32| I mean, with the anchor tenant at the other end with the Bud Cullum's development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5492)|
| 1:31:40| with the Publix and the Wal-Mart coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5500)|
| 1:31:45| I mean, there's a huge investment there, close to $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| The city's going to invest, you know, upwards of $13 million to $16 million in Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| I mean, this is a blighted piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| It's been an eyesore there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| And this is a great opportunity with no investment from the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| for an individual to come in and make this a much better place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| And why do we want a piece of property to remain after we're sitting there and spending the kind of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5527)|
| 1:32:14| the investment, in a mile, a mile and a half, whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| So, I mean, I think this is a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| I understand, you know, Mr. Knight, and I understand everybody else's position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| But, again, I'll go back and say to what Mr. Seymour said that, you know, they get nothing from the city but they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5544)|
| 1:32:32| I mean, we've made a tremendous investment in the last 12 to 15 years in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| I mean, the improvements we see every day, and we all benefit from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| All the businesses in downtown and the whole city really benefits from that investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5562)|
| 1:32:48| So, I do disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5568)|
| 1:32:51| So, I would hope that my colleagues would, again, move forward with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| I think it would be good for the city and for the Cumberland Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| I was the lone vote against this last time, and I have not spoken to Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| I did talk to Mr. York this afternoon briefly about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| And as I said to many of my colleagues after that last vote, I was not disturbed with the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5593)|
| 1:33:18| And I believe I said that to Mr. Wetzel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| And I still am concerned with some of the points that Mr. Seymour brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5601)|
| 1:33:27| But my main concern was the precedent I think this may set with others that might consider building hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| in areas that are not as desirable as some other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| And we may set a precedent that I don't think we'd regret, but we may have to pony up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| And while it's not money out of our pocket, it ultimately is money that we don't collect for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5623)|
| 1:33:49| while this five-year period is at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Anyhow, the bottom line of where I am is I am reluctantly going to support this and let it go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5633)|
| 1:34:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5642)|
| 1:34:03| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5643)|
| 1:34:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| I may be the lone vote here because from a principal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| I have a real problem with the fact that we have a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| and we're now saying that's part of the inner city or part of the downtown area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| And the question would be, I mean, are we setting a precedent and where are we headed with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5659)|
| 1:34:23| If I want to build a hotel out on Sutherland Avenue or the folks that are, whether it's a hotel or another kind of building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5663)|
| 1:34:30| I mean, where do we draw the line between what we say we're going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5670)|
| 1:34:34| and it's almost as though we've defined areas, we've said these are the things we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| and then all of a sudden an opportunity comes up, which I'm all in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| I think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| At the same time, if we want to all of a sudden say that something out on Magnolia Avenue or out Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| I mean, where do we draw the line and what do we have our rules and regulations for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| And when I read the application in terms of what they said with their nose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| I just have a real problem with trying to support this at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| I thought the last time that all the T's had been crossed and all the I's had been dotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5706)|
| 1:35:11| And I think we're setting a precedent that we're going to have to be real careful of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5711)|
| 1:35:14| So I'm just not in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Let me address just a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| One, to remind you all, the boxes that are marked no on our questionnaire are simply things that we ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5720)|
| 1:35:27| Those are not requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| What we did miss this time, and I'll have to turn to Mr. Swanson, we have to gain legal detail on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| was because of concerns just like yours, the state enabling ordinance says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| you cannot do hotel pilots unless they're in your central business district or your center city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| And so, clearly, we have a CBID that was established several years ago to raise funding to redevelop downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| But not every city has CBIDs, but everybody is available to declare what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| or what is not their center city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| And that's all we're asking you to do here tonight is say, this is part of our center city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| It fits the mission of this department to move from disinvestment to investment in the center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5768)|
| 1:36:09| But, I mean, if I'm out on Kingston Pike and want to get a pilot, is that part of the center city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5769)|
| 1:36:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| Those are, Mr. Gray, that would be judgment calls we have to make as staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| and you have to make as council at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| That's what those would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5784)|
| 1:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5785)|
| 1:36:26| Councilman Dallavothi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| Yeah, I guess I was going to dovetail off that because I was sitting here looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| As I remember, the last time this came up, the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| it was a requirement of the lender that he have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| or he wasn't going to sort of be able to do his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| And that swayed a lot of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| But the dovetail part is, how big does the center area grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5805)|
| 1:36:51| Are there unintended consequences, which is what I think Dwayne was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| In other words, as we push out, do we end up taking off, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5815)|
| 1:37:00| a fairness question in terms of someone else who comes to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| Is there a new definition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Are we just saying this little spot on Lakeside Avenue is in the center city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5825)|
| 1:37:09| but we don't know what else is or is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| I mean, I guess that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| I think what we're clarifying tonight is that this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| this particular property at this location, is in Knoxville Center City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5835)|
| 1:37:19| And we know that if we're going to do a hoax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| Without setting a boundary, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Well, I think the boundary is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| But that's why the IDB attorneys asked us to come back and clarify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| to make sure that we all agree that the UT area, the Cumberland Avenue area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| is a center city area, which it was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5855)|
| 1:37:37| It was West Knoxville for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| but we've grown considerably, 20-some miles out in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| So I think we're fine considering this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| As far as the future, it is a judgment call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| What we as a staff, what you as a council determine as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| So you don't have to, like, define a radius or a ring or something that's center city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5872)|
| 1:37:57| and everything else is not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5877)|
| 1:37:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| Could I sort of respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Because what the statute does is it provides that if there is a central business improvement district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| as we do have a central business improvement district, it clearly qualifies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5891)|
| 1:38:17| But it doesn't confine it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5897)|
| 1:38:19| You can have other pilots that will meet the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| as long as they are in what is designated by the legislative body as the central city area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| whatever the city central area that the legislative body designates as being that central city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5912)|
| 1:38:39| You get to decide whether it's central city area or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| You could do it piecemeal was what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| You really could because that's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| As long as you designate as a council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| And it doesn't provide any specific designation for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| The state legislature said that they felt comfortable in leaving that decision up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5934)|
| 1:38:59| as a municipal legislature to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5939)|
| 1:39:04| Are there any other consequences, whether they're perks, taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| anything that flows from being a central city area or is it just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| I'm not aware of any of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| That's just in this particular statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| And I don't think this particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| It's obviously a base that someone didn't feel comfortable checking off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| until they were sure that the legislature wanted to say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| You just have to decide for your own selves what you believe is this central area of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5966)|
| 1:39:32| And certainly I would agree with Arthur when he and James White were young men,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| probably that section of town may not have been the central city area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| But perhaps now it looks more like the central city area than it did at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| The Indians have moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| Councilwoman Palmer, are you finished, Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| I was just going to ask Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5992)|
| 1:39:54| It's kind of my understanding now that really the center of our city is downtown west, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| when you draw the big circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| I don't have the data to support that, but you could be accurate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6001)|
| 1:40:04| I could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| My understanding is so that basically, Mr. Swanson, that we're then saying that a pilot could happen anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| as long as we designate it as the center city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| Under the statute as it is currently written, that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| Let's put this in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| Remember, Cumberland Avenue is a redevelopment area for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| We are investing millions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6025)|
| 1:40:27| You all realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6027)|
| 1:40:28| And so we don't do this lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| You know, I hate that we're back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| We're not doing this lightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| This is a center city area that has blight that needs to be cured, and that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6040)|
| 1:40:41| I think we should be appreciative that the state legislature has left some discretion to the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6041)|
| 1:40:46| in determining what the central city is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| The other thing, and I said this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| this is probably one of the ugliest pieces of property as you go along Cumberland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| and I'm thrilled that we're going to finally have something there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6055)|
| 1:40:59| We've waited and waited and waited for someone to step up to the plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| We have somebody now who's coming in, a great reputation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| with a plan to do something very positive with this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| It fits well with the amount of money we're spending and investing on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| at both ends and in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| So I really think that we need to move on and approve this and move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6077)|
| 1:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| I also am going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| I supported it last time, but while we're throwing around these definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| would the inner city be a part of the center city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| Because I would like to see some pilots in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| And since you just said that we determine, I was going to ask Mr. Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6101)|
| 1:41:47| but since you just said that this body determines what the definition is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| and I'm hoping as we go forward that we will have some pilots in the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| especially in our inner city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| Nothing would thrill us more than getting an application from the Magnolia Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| or the Magnolia Warehouse District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| We would love to get one of those and go to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| Well, I hope we do in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Actually, there's a pilot at Five Points as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| Several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| Any other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6138)|
| 1:42:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6144)|
| 1:42:25| Reluctantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6145)|
| 1:42:26| One reluctant no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| 11H is a resolution approving an agreement between the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| and Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| to lease property located on the northern side of Langford Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| in order to provide the public temporary access to Tennessee River for non-motorized boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| We have a speaker signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6167)|
| 1:42:49| Vice Mayor Pavlis, would you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| As she makes her way down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6172)|
| 1:42:57| I really just want to say that with Patty, Ms. Barrier's vision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| I mean, this is really her deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| She pushed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| She made the city and me and Marshall Starr were down there on a cold Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| and looked at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| This has been her idea, and I appreciate the diligence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| and the hard work that she did to make this become a reality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| though it's short term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| but at least it's something that shows more activity down on the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| I think it's a great, great thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| and I hope people will really take advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| But, again, my hat's off to you for really pushing this and making it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| Ms. Barrier, please go ahead, state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| and per council rules, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6217)|
| 1:43:40| Thank you, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6220)|
| 1:43:43| I have to thank my husband, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| We were out in the water and kind of saw this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| so it was something we wondered about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| Anyways, to keep this short, I'm just going to read from what I handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6231)|
| 1:43:58| and I really do want to thank everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| and anyone that isn't on this list that worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| To Mayor Madeline Rojero, Nick Pavlis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6247)|
| 1:44:10| oh, sorry, Patricia Barrier, 807 Phillips Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| To Mayor Madeline Rojero, Nick Pavlis, and all City Council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| Bob Wetzel, Director of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6262)|
| 1:44:24| Dawn Michelle Foster, Assistant Director, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| As an old, severe community resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| and as a representative of the South Knoxville Neighborhood and Business Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| I wish to say thank you for the work that has gone into making this endeavor a positive experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| We ask Council to support Resolution 11H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| approving the agreement between the City and KCDC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| to provide South Knoxville public access to the river for non-motorized boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6289)|
| 1:44:56| It was a positive experience when we met March 3rd of this year on Lankford Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| to look at the possible use of an existing ramp to the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| Dawn Michelle Foster became our mentor in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6305)|
| 1:45:09| to open a small area for easy access to the river for people in South Knoxville and all to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6309)|
| 1:45:17| Both communication and updates have been often and welcome to the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| We hope this boat launch will be successful the time it is open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6323)|
| 1:45:28| and we are pleased to hear funding for Sutry Park has been announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6328)|
| 1:45:33| and we hope for continued open communication with the public and neighborhoods on the Sutry Landing Park design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6333)|
| 1:45:41| We are excited to see the boat launch open as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| Thank you again from SKNBC and as an old, severe resident on the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| Anything else, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| Mr. Russell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6358)|
| 1:45:59| I'd just like to follow up on Patty's and thank the rest of the City staff that's worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| This has been a pretty quick turnaround on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| Dawn Michelle has led the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6365)|
| 1:46:06| We've had help from law, engineering, public service and KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| This has been one of the better team efforts I've seen in a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| where people said, let's make it happen, and just everybody worked in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6373)|
| 1:46:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6378)|
| 1:46:19| Thank you, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6380)|
| 1:46:21| Thank you very much, Ms. Barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| And, Council, I have four kayaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| I'd be willing to meet you down there if anybody wants to launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6385)|
| 1:46:28| And I know Councilman Starr is a kayaker, so maybe we can meet the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| and we can all be down there one day and test it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6394)|
| 1:46:37| I think we will have a formal launch coming up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6397)|
| 1:46:40| I'll be able to do my Italian gondola song for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| I will certainly look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6409)|
| 1:46:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| Well, the A is an ordinance to waive city of Knoxville taxes on properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| that were acquired by the city of Knoxville or Knox County in past tax sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| only on the part of the taxes that remain uncollected after the properties have been sold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| at the city of Knoxville or Knox County for an amount that is less than a total amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| of city or county taxes still owed on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| and dividing the proceeds raised between the city of Knoxville and Knox County on a pro rata basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6433)|
| 1:47:20| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6440)|
| 1:47:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6446)|
| 1:47:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| 12B is an ordinance to amend and restate the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| of the city of Knoxville employees pension system so as to affect certain amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| required under the Internal Revenue Code to maintain the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| as a qualified governmental pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6463)|
| 1:47:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| Councilman Gallivalpi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| I just got to say this takes either a tax lawyer or a Talmudic scholar to read through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| It boggles the mind trying to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| I wanted to curl up with, you know, 2,000 pages of regulations and several statute books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6478)|
| 1:48:05| But I understand this helps us keep the qualified status of the pension plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6490)|
| 1:48:11| Yeah, this has nothing to do with the discussion that we are engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| It's a great nighttime reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6495)|
| 1:48:16| If you ever have trouble falling asleep, just go through a few pages of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6496)|
| 1:48:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6501)|
| 1:48:22| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| And that brings us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| We do have one person signed up for public forum, Ms. Jamie Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| Ms. Rowe, please come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| You know what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| Jamie Rowe, 4215 Tassel Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| Speaking on behalf of the Community Action Network,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| it isn't often that elected officials have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6528)|
| 1:48:52| to do something significant and great to make a difference in the lives of citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6532)|
| 1:48:59| However, June the 12th, your next council meeting, you will have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6539)|
| 1:49:05| Draft regulations from MPC regarding crematories will be on that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6545)|
| 1:49:12| And the proposed regulations are just simply not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| According to the zoning ordinance, the city council is empowered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| to encourage the most appropriate use of land to maintain our property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| secure safety from fire, flood, and other hazards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| and to promote the health, safety, and welfare of present and future inhabitants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6573)|
| 1:49:41| Even MPC acknowledges, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| the demand for cremation is increasing steadily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| and will involve 50% of all deaths by 2025, unquote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| That's only 13 years away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| Because of the increase in cremations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| these regulations need to be adopted that are clear and enforceable and stringent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6600)|
| 1:50:10| An example of proposed regulations by MPC says that crematories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6610)|
| 1:50:16| that aren't accessory to funeral homes and also pet crematories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| are to be a use on review in zones I, I, II, III, and IV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6621)|
| 1:50:28| Over 90% of uses on review applications are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6628)|
| 1:50:34| according to MPC in response to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| So a use on review is not much protection for any neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| In the zoning ordinance that is now in effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| I-III lists incinerators as prohibited uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| and I-IV, under a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| lists distillation of bones and dead animal reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6654)|
| 1:50:58| The ordinance isn't quiet on incineration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| and the distillation of bones is cremation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6661)|
| 1:51:06| Crematories and pet crematories should be as this ordinance is now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| located only in an I-IV zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| Weakening the ordinance brings smokestack industry to many areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| Why would you ever consider weakening the present ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6683)|
| 1:51:29| I-IV now includes, I'm sorry, I-I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6689)|
| 1:51:34| now includes such uses as call centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| and assembly of small electrical appliances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| while I-IV is your heavy industrial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| such uses as asphalt manufacturing quarries and railroad repair shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6705)|
| 1:51:51| We shouldn't be looking at minimal regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6711)|
| 1:51:56| because from a starting point on air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6716)|
| 1:52:00| according to the 2010 study by the American Lung Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6720)|
| 1:52:05| we're listed, Knoxville is listed as the 14th worst city in the nation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6725)|
| 1:52:12| for ozone pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| and 21st worst in the nation for particulate pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| So in both categories, we have a grade of F starting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| How can we even think of becoming a green city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6745)|
| 1:52:29| if we don't look at the best regulations in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| regarding crematories and model our ordinance after those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| Why would we want to poison our own air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| Crematories are a public health issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| We know there are cumulative dangers from emissions of mercury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| and other dangerous emissions including furans, cadmium, lead, and arsenic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| You must keep in mind that no one will be monitoring any of these emissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| anywhere in Knoxville a crematory is put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| There are no, no one federally, no one in the city, no one in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| not even the Air Pollution Control Board monitors any emissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| Ms. Rowe, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6799)|
| 1:53:21| The city is depending on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| Neighborhoods are at your mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Our health and that of our children and grandchildren are at your mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Please, I implore you to adopt the best regulations possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| Don't settle for less for the sake of all of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| Thank you very much, Mrs. Rowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6820)|
| 1:53:42| Okay, there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265120529?start=6822)|
