| 0:01:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| First item, Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Deferred discussion and possible action against beer permittees who have violated Knox County beer laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| pertaining to the sale or possession of untaxed alcoholic beverages unlawful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=117)|
| 0:02:02| TCA Subsection 57-3-304, Jeffrey Behrens, J.B.'s Creekside Tavern, 7428 Clinton Highway, on and off premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=122)|
| 0:02:13| Mr. Behrens, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=133)|
| 0:02:15| Go ahead, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Mr. Behrens, the procedure here today is we will ask the sheriff's department to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=139)|
| 0:02:25| and bring forth the testimony in regard to your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=145)|
| 0:02:30| After the testimony is given, then you will be able to stand and either affirm or deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=150)|
| 0:02:36| and then present the facts from your side to this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| They will be turned over to this board, and they will then deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=163)|
| 0:02:44| I'm going to ask the sheriff's office for some testimony before this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| Liffey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=168)|
| 0:02:56| On March 15, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=176)|
| 0:02:58| Knox County Sheriff Beer Inspector was conducting a walk-through at Creekside Tavern, 7428 Clinton Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=178)|
| 0:03:09| when two-quart jar glass-containing moonshine was found in a freezer in the back room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=189)|
| 0:03:20| Mr. Behrens was cited for possession of illegal alcohol untaxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=200)|
| 0:03:31| Mr. Behrens, if you will, your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=211)|
| 0:03:34| No, there's not much to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=214)|
| 0:03:36| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=216)|
| 0:03:39| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| I'd like to ask the question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| What are our choices to do in this matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=227)|
| 0:03:49| Well, from the civil side, this is a first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=229)|
| 0:03:54| I didn't get testimony as a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| They are not a responsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=238)|
| 0:04:00| So the penalty is the standard, if you want it, up to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=240)|
| 0:04:10| What about this letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| He was mentioning a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| He got a letter, and it was to bring him here is what he was talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=256)|
| 0:04:21| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| It said for the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| You can have a letter of first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Is that what you all wanted to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| And put it in his file for 36 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| or you can go with the first offense as under the other offense rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=279)|
| 0:04:41| So he can have a letter just in the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Or notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Or any other up to $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| Or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| It's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| This is an unusual one that we don't usually have this type of an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Usually it's another offense kind of that we're always aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| This one has and it allows us to give a letter of admonishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| It allows us to do the first offense rule for a nonresponsible vendor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| And so that's kind of where you are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| and you can deliberate it any way you want to, truthfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Captain May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Was this a routine inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Did you have knowledge that they were selling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| or did it just become aware on an inspection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| I received an email on Saturday, February 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=340)|
| 0:05:45| It says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| At Creekside Tavern and Pal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| witness a bartender serve a group of underage kids alcohol for about an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| After, we witnessed two women snorting some drug in the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| as well as two men exchanging money in bags.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=356)|
| 0:05:59| This place should be shut down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| And it was anonymous, sent in to the sheriff's hotline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| and that's why we did the walkthrough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Did the ABC, was the ABC involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=370)|
| 0:06:12| I'm not really concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| ABC was with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| Did they take any action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=375)|
| 0:06:17| No, because they don't have a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| I did all the charging through Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Has that been adjudicated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| It's been agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| He agreed two weeks ago when we were in court that he was going to plead in criminal sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=388)|
| 0:06:38| and then come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| Is there a fine involved in criminal sessions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=400)|
| 0:06:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Or is it dismissed upon payment of cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| They've not done it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| We haven't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| That won't be until Thursday, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| But he has agreed to come today with the knowledge that he will plead guilty on the next court date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=411)|
| 0:07:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=421)|
| 0:07:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| I'm not worried about the anonymous email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| If they don't put their name on it, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=425)|
| 0:07:07| Can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=427)|
| 0:07:08| Sure, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I mean, we're 21 and up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| We're a smoking environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| We card everyone no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I can promise you there were no minors in the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| We've carded everybody since day one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=438)|
| 0:07:20| You know, and I pushed out when I was over at Brickyard Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| I never would let anybody in without an ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| And I would definitely not serve minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=450)|
| 0:07:31| And sort of a follow-up on Captain Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=451)|
| 0:07:34| Earlier, as you were speaking, this is not in connection then with an underage attempted buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=454)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Hey, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| You know, I understand everything that's going to be said here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| There was an offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=472)|
| 0:07:54| And I don't think a letter is nearly severe enough for selling, you know, moonshine in a business that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| Well, that has moonshine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| I don't want to get into a back-and-forth with you, but if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| If it's there, and you're selling beverages of the alcoholic nature, I'm a fairly reasonable person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=492)|
| 0:08:21| I would not think you're bringing it there to serve to your staff that it is for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| So that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| And you're not going to convince me otherwise, so don't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| I mean, but my point is, I don't think a simple letter at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| I think this is egregious enough that we should do a fine of some type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| I think the typical first offense is $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| So I'm going to make a motion that we have a $500 fine or a 30-day suspension, correct, or 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=522)|
| 0:08:52| But I'm going to get fined in the criminal court, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=532)|

| 0:09:03| It may not pass here, but that's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=543)|

| 0:11:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| Mr. Chair, I think he had asked earlier if she could get an interpreter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| Is that what you asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=683)|

| 0:11:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=686)|

| 0:11:33| Mr. Law Director, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Adrian, are you going to interpret for Ms. Pedro?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=699)|

| 0:11:45| Where's Mike Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| I don't think we have an interpreter present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=707)|

| 0:11:54| No, not that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=716)|
| 0:11:57| Then I think we probably will need to defer this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| and try to make arrangements for an interpreter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| because she needs due process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| needs to understand what she's being accused of and be able to dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| I will move that we defer this matter until the next board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=729)|

| 0:16:56| We start with our public forum, and we have Denny Wren as the first person to speak at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| Mr. Wren, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| My name is Denny Wren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| I reside at 12224 West Ashton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| You have five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Ladies and gentlemen, members of the commission, good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| Several months ago, I submitted an application online for a job with the Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| for a position of security guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| On June 20th, I was contacted by the security office and asked if I'd like to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| for the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| I accepted the offer and was scheduled for the following morning, June 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| The interview was conducted by Dr. Russell and Chief Pedousis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| I felt the interview went extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| During the interview, I was asked if there was anything keeping me from accepting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| position if it was offered to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| I said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| I told both of them I had a family wedding planned at the end of July, first of August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| for a family member that I had to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| I already had flight, car, and hotel reservations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| And I was told that if I was chosen, they would somehow work around my plans and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| family was first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| That same morning, two and a half hours later, I received a phone call with an email stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| I had been accepted and to show up for orientation on Monday, June 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1101)|
| 0:18:26| I went to orientation that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| It took all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| And during the orientation, we were instructed on the policies and procedures of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| County Schools along with a drug test and a psychological evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| We were told that we would be contacted by Friday evening if for some reason we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Friday came and went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| I didn't hear anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| We were told no news is good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| So I showed up for our first day of training, Monday, July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| During the first hour of training, it was noted that several of us had mustaches and we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| to shave them off before returning back to class on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| There was a little bit of confusion because the instructor had a mustache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1146)|
| 0:19:10| He was a Knox County School security guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| He said they were okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| One said they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| One said they weren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Anyway, it was ruled by the chief later that during the five weeks of training, no mustaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1156)|
| 0:19:23| During that same first day, we went over the schedule for the five weeks of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| And the date of August 5th was mentioned as being a very important day of training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| That was supposed to be the last day of my vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| So after the first day of training, I went home, shaved off my mustache, and explained to my wife we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| needed to change our flight reservations and come home a day earlier because I didn't want to miss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1181)|
| 0:19:46| training on August the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| And I don't know if any of you have ever changed your flight reservations at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| It gets rather expensive, especially for a family of four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Well, I returned to training the following morning, Tuesday, with no mustache and ready to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| And right before our lunch break, several names were called out and we were told that they needed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| speak to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1206)|
| 0:20:08| I wasn't sure exactly how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| I believe it was ten people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| I assumed that they wanted to talk to me about my vacation schedule and go over the days that I was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| missing and how to make them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| That wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| One by one, each person went into a room, came out, turned in all their handouts, turned in their ID badges, and left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1222)|
| 0:20:30| And since my name starts with W, I was the last to be called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I knew they were calling me in to go over my vacation plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| That wasn't the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| I was told I could no longer go forward in the process and that I was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| I asked why, and I was told they didn't give a reason, nor did they have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1243)|
| 0:20:49| I asked again, and the same thing was told to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| They couldn't tell me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| I also asked when they knew something was wrong, and I was told late Friday night prior to us starting our training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1254)|
| 0:21:02| I went out to the parking lot with several others who were just let go, and nobody seemed to know anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| With our jaws wide open and hanging to the ground, we all left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Upon getting home, I sent an email to Chief Bedousas, Dr. McIntyre, and to the mayor asking to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| and gather some answers that I felt I deserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| On July the 8th, Chief Bedousas called me and told me the reason why I didn't have consistency with my answers on the psych test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1281)|
| 0:21:28| I have yet to hear back from the other two offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| Now I know that every employer has the right to test as they see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| I also understand Tennessee is a right-to-work state, and you may hire and fire at will with no explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| What I don't understand is why we all started before the results were in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| I know of no other employer that operates like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Unlike what you may have read, psych test is not a pass or fail type test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1311)|
| 0:21:57| There are no right or wrong answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| It's a profile exam to see if the exam taker meets the profile of the type of individual you're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1319)|
| 0:22:06| Here are the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Eight to ten of the current guards wouldn't pass or meet the qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| In fact, with the size of this commission, two or three of you wouldn't meet the qualification either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| Mr. Wren, our limits are five minutes, and you've already gone past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| Could I have two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Could you summarize quickly, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| I've said publicly about this process has ruined my chances of getting another job with the county forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| But I feel that those other people let go deserve a better chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| Those are people who didn't hear anything until they had already started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| and been told that they would hear something prior to starting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Here's my employment history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1365)|

| 0:24:09| Mr. Wheeler, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Give your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1452)|
| 0:24:13| My name is Carl Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I reside at 2631 Bakertown Road, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| Been a taxpayer and resident of Knox County for 33 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| Seen a lot come and seen a lot go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| What I want to speak to this morning or this afternoon is the upcoming agenda item that has to do with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1466)|
| 0:24:35| I know that there have been 20-odd people that applied for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| Some have given presentations and some haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| But I also know that one of the gentlemen just spoke a minute ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1482)|
| 0:24:48| have spoke to the commission about the process in terms of selecting a replacement for Mr. Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1488)|
| 0:24:58| It would seem to me with the issues that have evolved out of that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1498)|
| 0:25:07| that we might want to give careful consideration to appointing someone who has ideas about running in some time period for that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1507)|
| 0:25:22| Not just a caretaker, but someone who is interested in running for the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| I think that's a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| There's been enough problems in that office right now that we need to take a closer look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| and perhaps identify someone on this slate here that has no interest in running for the job after 14 August 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1537)|
| 0:25:51| And, secondly, is more interested in bringing some trust to that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| I need not say what's happened in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| You all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| But I still think that there needs to be a clean slate, that whoever takes over that office needs to be squeaky clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1561)|
| 0:26:11| I thank the commission for the time to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Now, I think I had a couple other one other person signed up, Ms. Absher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I think she wants to speak also to the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| So, Mr. Andrew and Ms. Absher, we'll just hold those until the item comes up on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1585)|
| 0:26:32| If that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Let's move to our honoraria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=1597)|

| 0:36:05| Thanks, commissioners and ladies and gentlemen in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| My first exposure to Ms. Pionke on a professional level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| other than just sort of the routine meetings where we encounter sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| some of the folks from the engineering department, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| was during the Ridge Top and Steep Slope Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2183)|
| 0:36:29| And Ms. Pionke worked in that task force on various committees for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| as you all suffered through this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| And in that process, I came to know her pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| not only in terms of her professional ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2203)|
| 0:36:47| but just how she truly cares about this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| and she uses her great skill and expertise at trying to make this a better place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2212)|
| 0:36:59| And she does it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| So I greatly appreciate her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| and it's my honor to sign on to this honorarium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| So I greatly appreciate her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2231)|
| 0:37:18| I just want to say thank you for the recognition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| and nothing can really surpass when it was announced to me that I had won the award,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| and back in April at our professional conference, because I was stunned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2246)|
| 0:37:33| and I believe I forgot to thank my husband at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| So I'd like to take that opportunity to do that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2261)|
| 0:37:50| Cindy, we want to take this time to thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| because you go to a lot of meetings and you've got developers on one side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| and you've got citizens on the other, and both are very opinionated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| and you come in and say, here's what the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| And I've seen you do that several times in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| and you're very professional in what you do, and you do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I've enjoyed working with you as an MPC commissioner and as a county commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| So you're one of our great, great employees that we have here for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2291)|
| 0:38:14| Thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you for the kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| Item 105,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| proclaiming Knox County a Purple Heart County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| the first county in the state of Tennessee so designated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2309)|
| 0:38:35| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Tim Burch at 501 Princeton Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I have with me four gentlemen who have received the medal that my dad said he never wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2325)|
| 0:38:55| It's a Purple Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| These men were injured in combat in the defense of our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| It would be appropriate, maybe our veterans could come down here and stand with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| I know you have some veterans on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| Would that be appropriate, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| And that's what this is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| It's giving Knox County would be the first county in the state to have this designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| as officially a Purple Heart County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| It will be on our letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| And to me, it just sends a positive message to our veterans that we appreciate what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| This is just a small piece of gratitude we can give to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| So, any of our veterans, Arthur, you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| Is that okay, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2378)|
| 0:39:39| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| I would like to say, many of our young people are listening, maybe back at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| if you're not in front of your computer, your Game Boy right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| that everything we have in our country we owe to these men that are standing behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| And I just want to say I have a complete debt of gratitude to my uncle, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| if you come into my office, 48-star flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| He was awarded the Purple Heart posthumously about 14 days after D-Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| And, of course, my father fought, but he never got the Purple Heart, thank goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Mr. Mayor, I don't think any of us went looking for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| And if you would give your name to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| My name, I am Arthur McGinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| I live in Concord, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| I am honored to present this plaque to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| proclaiming Knox County the Purple Heart County of Tennessee, first in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2432)|
| 0:40:40| Let them vote on it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2443)|
| 0:40:50| You all want to go ahead and vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| We already voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2453)|
| 0:40:54| Yeah, I thought they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| Let me present this to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| In addition to that, we have for you to display the official flag of the Military Order of the Purple Heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2460)|
| 0:41:11| And let me get someone to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2471)|
| 0:41:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2482)|
| 0:41:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2493)|
| 0:41:53| Mr. Chairman, may I make just a comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Because this is, to be down here with these gentlemen, is really one of the honors that we have as a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| And as many of you know, I served in Baghdad and Afghanistan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| And I am not a hero, but I served with a lot of heroes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| And we had, in Afghanistan, in our tents, in our tent hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| we had a sign that was over the entrance where all the wounded soldiers came through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| to remind us who these people really were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| And the sign said, it's not the journalist who gives us freedom of the press,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| but the soldiers who've made the sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| It's not the ministers who give us freedom of religion, but it's the soldiers who have made the sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2552)|
| 0:42:39| And it's not the politicians that allow us to practice democracy, but the soldiers have made the sacrifices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| My father was an infantryman in World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| He has two Purple Hearts also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| And my father is one of the people that I respect more, that I've really used as my role model on public service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| And these gentlemen that I'm standing here right now, it's one of the biggest honors I've had to even be associated with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| since I've been on the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| And I want to thank them again for the sacrifices they've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| It really means a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2588)|
| 0:43:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2590)|
| 0:43:30| So as past commander of Knoxville Chapter 356 and senior vice commander for the Department of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2610)|
| 0:43:38| I thank the county for this honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| You're welcome to attend our meetings any time you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| We meet on the third Tuesday at noon at Shoney's on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| If you come early, you get to eat before the meeting starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2635)|

| 0:43:59| You honor us with your presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| Mr. Chairman, if it's all right, if Buzz Buswell, our director of Veterans Affairs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| who's also a Purple Heart recipient, could say a couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| He told me he didn't want to say anything, but I'm going to order him up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| Do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Buzz, give your name and address there for the people on television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2654)|

| 0:44:19| I live at 1101 Remington in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2659)|

| 0:44:27| My dad's retired from the Air Force, and I went into the Army the day after he left the Air Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2667)|
| 0:44:32| So there's always been orders, and I always follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| I want to thank all of you for honoring the combat veterans of our community with this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| I would like to say a couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| I was the first state commander.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| And your name, too, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| My name is Arthur Martin, and I live in Tandridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| And I was the first state commander from eastern Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2700)|
| 0:45:05| Our second state commander is going to be Arthur McGinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2716)|
| 0:45:35| All right, Madam Clerk, we're going to go into regular session now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Mr. Chairman, before we do that, could I have just a second, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| I personally want to thank the mayor for making this happen, honoring the veterans today, the Purple Heart winners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| I also want to thank the mayor today for something that's been before us over the last few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2751)|
| 0:45:58| and that's the mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| The mayor helped sponsor a Saturday get-together that was called Two Wheels for Meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2761)|
| 0:46:15| I was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| I got a shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| The reason that mobile meals has been before us is because they've been having trouble fundraising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| and meeting the requirements of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| And through this fundraising effort, I hope they become better prepared to help those in Knox County that need assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2790)|
| 0:46:38| Also, former chair of commission, Mike Hammond, is sponsoring something tonight in relation to this mobile meals also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2798)|
| 0:46:48| and I'd like for him to give the information for that because fundraising for mobile meals is still going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| If you can help, please get a hold of those folks and help them feed our elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2819)|

| 0:47:13| That's why I had to leave just a moment ago as she called to say she is on her way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2833)|

| 0:47:22| And it's right off of Lovell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| It's $5 admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| It's a donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| All money is going to go to mobile meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| And, of course, you can donate more if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2849)|
| 0:47:30| But we'd like to invite anyone who would like to come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2850)|
| 0:47:32| It's going to be a good show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| This will be our first performance in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| And we're very honored that she could come and be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2856)|

| 0:48:13| Our Heavenly Father, as we gather today as a community and as elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| give us the wisdom to make wise decisions for our county and for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2898)|

| 0:48:42| to their families who are concerned about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| and especially to those that have sacrificed so much so we can practice the freedoms that we enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=2924)|

| 1:10:39| Hey, thanks for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| This is primarily because of the parking garage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| Primarily because of the parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| And it's a 10-year deal, 10-year pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| And after it's paid back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| then I'm just reading the letter from Dr. Walker in Dunlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| I assume that you're like your loan brokers or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| They're loan originators with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| Originator with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| And it's going to be a HUD 221D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| What tweaked my curiosity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| I'm not criticizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| I just wondered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4271)|
| 1:11:12| I love this concept, the sales tax recapture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4272)|
| 1:11:15| You know, you point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| The $228,000 of sales tax recapture for CBID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| No, and that's free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Oh, yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I'm just wondering, how did you get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| So, I mean, it's going to probably take 10 accountants to keep up with it to see if it really happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| But how did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| That number comes from, in our market studies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| they have a prediction of what, say, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| the gross annual income of our particular tenants might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4298)|
| 1:11:43| And then you can break that down into the percentage that they would actually spend of their disposable income within the CBID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4303)|
| 1:11:52| And that has a very particular number that you can attach to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| That's using 238 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| Yes, and about 300 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| 300 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| I'm not criticizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I'm glad you pointed that out because I remember when that got down as a special act of the legislature to let the sales tax recapture happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4322)|
| 1:12:10| That's the total sales tax recapture, not just the SCUs portion or CBIDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4330)|
| 1:12:15| That's the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| I mean, it's still a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| $957 a unit a year and about $80 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Yeah, that's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Yeah, it's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4345)|

| 1:12:36| Anything else, Mr. Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4356)|

| 1:13:27| and the insurance company have sent the county, and with just kind of what's been going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| and what's been said from those letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| I think it's important that we as a commission do a background check on the new trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4415)|
| 1:13:39| I think it's important that each commissioner speak with, if they have questions of the state comptroller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| and also possibly, if necessary, talk to the bonding agent that we're discussing this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4425)|
| 1:13:51| And I personally would like to know if, because I have two different fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4431)|
| 1:13:56| if we're doing caretaker versus other as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| And so my motion is to delay for at least 14 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4441)|
| 1:14:06| and set up a special called meeting at the pleasure of the chairman and the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| and to appoint a trustee at that time after we have completely vetted the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| And the way I see it happening is if a commissioner has somebody in mind that they would like to be vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4457)|
| 1:14:22| then we find a way to do a background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| or they can do kind of a background check on them and vet that third process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| I just, how many, I lost track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| It's up in the 20s, I believe, of the people who are, you know, who have put in for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| Can we get, how many are there, 26?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| We've got 26 applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| Are we going to do background checks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| I think, the way I see it, I mean, you know who your two or three people you're going to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| And if there's somebody that we want to consider and have a background,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| it's up to the commissioner that is wanting to vote for that person or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4499)|
| 1:15:02| I mean, we sat through a three-minute interview and we're going to give somebody a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| that's probably one of the most important jobs in the county on a three-minute interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| And I think they need to be further vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| And I think this is a process to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Who's going to, who does the vetting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| I mean, you're in the, I'm not being critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| We could ask for them, for example, if you wanted to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4519)|
| 1:15:25| you just take Candidate A and just tell them to go down to the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| and have a criminal background check done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| And correct me if I'm wrong, J.J., are you listening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| And if we wanted to have a candidate have a background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| they could come down and sign a release in your office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| and you would report that to the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| And then also we could, I mean, I think it's imperative, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| some of the folks are very qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I think it's imperative that we may even check in with, just as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| kind of vet them on a personal level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| And if you know somebody that works somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| and if that previous employer wants to discuss it, then talk to them about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| I think it's important that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Can we get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| I mean, that's 26 people or a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| It's not 26 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| It's four or five maybe because you're only looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| If everybody had one candidate, you're only looking at 11 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4577)|
| 1:16:23| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| I mean, I think having another meeting with commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4584)|
| 1:16:30| personally feeling better about their candidate, I think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| Because the comptroller and the bonding insurance company has released a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| I think we need to take consideration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| I mean, I think one of the assumptions you're making is that everybody out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| already knows who they're going to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| And, you know, we don't even know who's going to be put forward to be voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| That's my only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| If you're going to put somebody forward to be voted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| I would recommend you vet them a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| Ms. Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| It's true that 25 or, well, now 26, although that one was after the deadline, so I don't count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| People have put in their resumes, but only a dozen people showed up for the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| One of those was disqualified because he doesn't live in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| And one was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| His father came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| So, frankly, in my opinion, if they could not get here for the interview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| they're no longer considered in my book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| So we're not looking at 25 people to be vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| For me, it's down to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| So I agree with Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| I think we need to take a little more time on this and take a little closer look at the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| Some of the candidates I feel like I know very well, and some of the candidates I don't know at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| And I don't believe that's a ---- I would like to feel like I have adequate information on all of the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| before we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4681)|
| 1:18:02| So, Brad, I think that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| I would even suggest that instead of 14 days that we just do it at next month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| I think it's also important that we have Mike Brown here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| I think this is a vote that he needs to be here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4702)|
| 1:18:23| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| I was just going to ask that very question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4704)|
| 1:18:25| If we're looking at 14 days, are all the commissioners available in 14 days for a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| or could we have it as part of the regular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Because in Miss, is it Miss Kristen Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Isn't she there until the end of August anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| She's there until we have to do something by October 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| So she will be there until that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| That's our deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| I wanted to ask about the background checks because we've talked about criminal, but isn't this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| they're wanting to know about finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| So, Mr. Caldwell, Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4739)|
| 1:19:05| If we're going to do background checks, the criminal aspect is one aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| If we're going to be looking at credit, credit history, that type thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| if you could give us some guidance as to what the bonding companies are going to be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4755)|
| 1:19:31| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| It is true that what the bonding company will look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| and our broker in particular will look at their financial history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4775)|
| 1:19:39| And so alongside a criminal background check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| it wouldn't be a bad idea of getting some sort of financial background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| Now, we can go through purchasing and figure out our best avenue to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4789)|
| 1:19:55| Because if you're going to do one, you might as well do the other because the bond is based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| supposedly based on the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| We know what happened with our last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| It's not the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| It's the history of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| But in reality, it's the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| So it's the person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| So $18.5 million is what we're looking at for the bond, right, for this individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| It is an individual bond to protect Knox County in the event something happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| Now, the other thing that I understood is that we're looking at policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| and procedures in that office in addition to the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| So how do we so the policies and procedures, how do we address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| So there are already policies and procedures in place in the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4839)|
| 1:20:45| What we are doing is our external auditors are just going to put some procedures in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| to do some additional audit work during the closeout to make sure that the things that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4853)|
| 1:21:00| during the low administration and going to the CTAS payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| that those things are checked to kind of give a double check to make the bonding company feel more relaxed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4865)|
| 1:21:15| about giving us a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| And it also gives our auditors, you know, some comfort as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| I think it's also important to note, we talked about this in our workshop today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4883)|
| 1:21:26| but I think the public needs to know in this bonding is that we were looking at, what, an $8,000 bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| And now because of what has gone on, we're looking at that tripling to about $24,000, $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4891)|
| 1:21:37| So, I mean, this is something that we really, really got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| So that bond is the premium of usually about $8,500 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| And now we think it's going to probably at least be $24,000 to $26,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4907)|
| 1:21:53| What did the comptroller say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| I know that Mr. Anders had talked about the comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| And what was the comptroller's statements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4917)|
| 1:22:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| The mayor called the comptroller last week when our bond was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4921)|
| 1:22:07| And we had a conversation with the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| And the mayor informed him of what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| And he told us to keep the office open and do the daily, the day-to-day activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| But as far as investing and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| that you would think the bond would be there for to try to stay away from those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| and just to go about collecting property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| So, in other words, Ms. Phillips, now, this is nothing against her personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4953)|
| 1:22:37| I want to make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| She's, you know, she's doing a good job, will do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| But in terms of her being able to invest, there are certain things that she can't do because of the bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4961)|
| 1:22:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| If there's not a bond, I do think that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| there's some discussion between what's right and what's wrong between comptroller and CTAS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| But that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| The fact of the matter is we have an investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| And I think Commissioner Shouse knows on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| He sits on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| And we have a policy that sets forth our policy for investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| It's very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Our money is in a safe place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| And even if things started to go south in a hurry, you can never act quick enough to get it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| So it's not anything to be overly concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| So if we were to delay this for any period of time, the ability of that office to function is not in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| The office can function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| When we do have an investment policy in place, that policy would remain in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| In other words, she wouldn't be able to change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| It would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| But it could continue running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| I want to make sure we got that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Mr. Chairman, I'm all in favor of a delay here because I think the worst thing we could do is to feel hurried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5031)|
| 1:23:57| and rushed and make a wrong decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5037)|
| 1:23:59| I want to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| And if it takes a few more days to go through this vetting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| and to make sure that we've got all of this, I'm all in favor of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| If the body wants to vote today, I'm prepared to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| But I personally would like to have a few more days to ask some of these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5051)|
| 1:24:16| and to properly vet some of these things so that I know that when I vote, I'm making the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5065)|
| 1:24:26| Commissioner Hammond touched on most of what my questions were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| Two things real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| The first one, Commissioner Burroughs talked of 25 names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5074)|
| 1:24:40| I do think the number is 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| That last person, they actually complied with a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| They made a request, how do I apply, and they were given send an email to the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| and that was done before that 12 noon deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| So I think we need to consider all 26 names here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| You know, everyone can have their own reasons for cutting names in or out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5101)|
| 1:25:06| whether they showed up or not, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| But I do think all 26 names need to appear before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| And my second kind of follow-up to Commissioner Hammond is just a general question of the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| Is there anything that during that discussion with he and Ms. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| is there anything from a legal standpoint as far as the bonding that we need to understand going into this potential delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5124)|
| 1:25:31| or potential vote as it relates to the bonding issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5131)|
| 1:25:36| I think, excuse me, I think Mr. Caldwell covered it pretty succinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5136)|
| 1:25:42| The only disparity between the comptroller's office and the CTAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| or even our law department's position statutorily is whether they can invest or not invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| And the comptroller felt more comfortable not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| The statute is silent on bonding for a chief deputy in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5155)|
| 1:25:59| So legally they can act on behalf of the county to the fullest by statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5159)|
| 1:26:07| What we were going after the bond for is we felt that it would be more protective anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| And Ms. Phillips qualified for the bond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| and then we had these other issues come up that wouldn't be related to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| So I think everything is before the commission, both legally and from, you know, policy standpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5179)|
| 1:26:25| I think you have the information, as I would tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| And I don't know if this is for you or Ms. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| If, you know, if we do our due diligence, we go out there and we get these reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| are we comfortable that that successful candidate, he or she, will get a reasonable bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5197)|
| 1:26:45| and that that bond won't always be, you know, three times that we will restore whatever, I hate to say trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5205)|
| 1:26:53| but whatever misgivings that our rating agencies have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5213)|
| 1:26:59| Is this a blip or is this a shift in terms of folks thinking of Knox County in our statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5219)|
| 1:27:09| I've learned that once price goes up, it's always hard to get it to go back down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| But having said that, we will work with our broker over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| After year one to try to get that price down on that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5240)|
| 1:27:26| We know that our broker has basically told us, which I said today and I'll say again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5246)|
| 1:27:33| is that they have reasonably assured us that if a respectable person is chosen that we could get the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5253)|
| 1:27:45| We didn't know it was going to cost more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5265)|
| 1:27:46| And then after year one when the election happens next August and whatever happens then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| then we would apply for a new surety bond and would attempt to get a lower price based on, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5272)|
| 1:28:00| the history of the office, you know, we prove that it's a blimp and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5280)|
| 1:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| You know, I'm not concerned about $8,000 to $24,000, but if it affects our ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5287)|
| 1:28:12| that's really, I guess, what hopefully this doesn't have any long-term kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| I can tell you that during the hour I had ratings calls with our agencies this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5296)|
| 1:28:22| and that was not even broached, so I think we're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5302)|
| 1:28:28| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| I kind of echo the words of Commissioner Hammond that I'm ready to vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5314)|
| 1:28:42| I do want to ensure that we select someone who would possess the qualities necessary to fulfill the duties of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5322)|
| 1:28:54| I do not know that there are or there are not people on the list of 26 that maybe shouldn't be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5334)|
| 1:29:07| It's sort of the way I look at it is if we go to the election next year, we do not do a background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5347)|
| 1:29:16| The people that go to the ballot box do the background check, and they don't do it like we're discussing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5356)|
| 1:29:25| In fact, that brings to mind the resolution that we've just passed just in the last few minutes, that being 818.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5365)|
| 1:29:35| And whenever I read a couple of paragraphs, we're already talking about things that are not included in that resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| being that there is a deadline passed that no one can submit another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| Paragraph 1 and 2 of that resolution, both in black print there, I believe I read that, as a commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5389)|
| 1:29:58| I can bring you the name of and nominate a person today in this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5398)|
| 1:30:03| and that person not necessarily even have to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| All there has to be is a note that I possess saying that if they are appointed, they'll accept the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5407)|
| 1:30:15| So I'm now going from one extreme to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| When denominations close, they close whenever we've polled the 11 members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5420)|
| 1:30:32| And who can be elected as we've got in our Resolution 818?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5432)|
| 1:30:37| Anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| We can appoint anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| That's the one extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| The other extreme is we can put it off for two weeks or we can put it off for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5443)|
| 1:30:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Dr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Yeah, I just wanted to comment again, and I really agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5454)|
| 1:30:58| and have the same concerns that Commissioner Anders has and also that Commissioner Hammond has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5458)|
| 1:31:06| about trying to get it right because I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5466)|
| 1:31:10| But it seems like the thing that we're concerned about the most deals with we want to be certain we choose someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5470)|
| 1:31:17| who we can bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| And the criminal background check is certainly, you know, part of that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| I'm not sure exactly what we have to do to do the credit checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| But we as individuals trying to do that, that's not to say that we might miss something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| and we might go ahead and think we've got the right person and then they can't be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| And I think that's what a lot of the concern is about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5496)|
| 1:31:40| One thing that I want to throw out there for consideration is because we're really not going to know they're bonded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5500)|
| 1:31:48| until the bonding company gets the name of an individual and then reviews it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| One of the things that we could do is to go ahead and if we can get six votes on someone is to make the appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5512)|
| 1:32:01| even today, with the contingent that we have to be able to get a bond at a reasonable price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5521)|
| 1:32:08| Now, we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| Well, we can spend a month or two months doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| And then we can nominate someone still they may not be able to get bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| They may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| But the thing is this is the same thing we did with the judicial magistrates is that we nominated somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5538)|
| 1:32:27| and on further review by the judges they said that person is not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| And so we had to go back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| But we didn't know because of the process we had at that time whether that person was going to be acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| until we put the name out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| And that's something we can do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| We may think that we do our due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| But the bonding company, who has a real financial interest in it, may dig in places that I don't know how to dig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5565)|
| 1:32:54| either looking for credit or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| I mean, I'm just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5578)|
| 1:32:59| I mean, it's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Would you like to make that as a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| Can we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Well, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| I might end up voting against it myself if I hear, you know, a good argument against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| But I'll put that out as a substitute motion that we go ahead, vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| and with the contingent that if we can't get this person bonded at a reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| because that's what the concern is, is about the bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5601)|
| 1:33:24| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| That we, that there is a contingent on there that we would reject it once we get back from the bonding company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5605)|
| 1:33:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| So we've got a motion, a substitute motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| Who seconded it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5619)|
| 1:33:40| Mr. Smith seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| Mr. Law Director, as we get into that discussion, does that seem reasonable as far as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5623)|
| 1:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5633)|
| 1:33:54| Everything is at the pleasure of this body as to how you want to handle this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| I don't see any, you know, there's no legal position right now that's in violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Well, I guess I'd like to argue that point because if you elect somebody, you give somebody six votes, they are appointed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| And the only way to remove them from office is through ouster or any other means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| You can't set parameters on an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| We did it with the judicial magistrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| If you'll let me, I'll let you have your time if you'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| The judicial magistrates are county employees that are appointments of the judges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| and employees of the judges in the General Sessions Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| They are not the county banker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| And I think once you six vote somebody, you have put somebody in office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| And I don't think you can take that away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5678)|
| 1:34:41| As a commission, you cannot take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5681)|
| 1:34:43| I just don't see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5683)|
| 1:34:44| I think that's a legal challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| The statute states that once a person is basically nominated and elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| they must take an oath and be bonded to actually hold the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5695)|
| 1:35:00| If they're not bonded, then they're not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| And I think they will be disqualified as a candidate and an elected official at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| Just like any other elected official we find is not eligible to be elected, then the election would be void.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5709)|
| 1:35:20| I'll be glad to get you a better opinion on that, but I think that's where we would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| I think that enters Knox County into some muddy waters that we don't need if we can defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| and get away from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5730)|
| 1:35:54| All right, we have Ms. Broils, do you want to go first here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| Yes, be that as it may about bonding and holding office or appointments or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5759)|
| 1:36:07| if a commissioner asks to postpone something, as a general rule, out of professional courtesy, we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5767)|
| 1:36:17| There are commissioners here who would like, obviously, to have this postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5777)|
| 1:36:21| I also think that, you know, Mike Brown had intended to miss today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| He planned it before all this erupted with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| And I think that this is an important enough vote that all of us need to be here for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5792)|
| 1:36:39| And I think that out of professional courtesy, if there are some who would like to postpone it, as a general rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5799)|
| 1:36:46| we do that as a commission and also out of respect for our colleague who's not here and who ought to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5806)|
| 1:36:52| We need to postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5812)|
| 1:36:57| We do have, well, I've got lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5817)|
| 1:37:02| We have a couple of people that have signed up to speak on the issue of trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5822)|
| 1:37:08| I feel like we ought to give them that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| Would you like to have, is that okay if we do that right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5835)|
| 1:37:16| So if you had, I think, Mr. Andrew, Ms. Absher, would you like to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| If you would, come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5850)|
| 1:37:31| And give your name, Ms. Absher, and your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| You'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| My name is Sally Absher, 5517 Riverpoint Cove, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| Thank you for the time to speak on this issue today, and I've enjoyed the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| I, too, would like to see this deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| I have discussed my concerns via e-mail and in person with Ed Schaus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| but I feel so strongly about this issue that I wanted to make my comments publicly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| I am very concerned about the message that this sends to the voters of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5882)|
| 1:38:07| that we have a sitting Knox County commissioner applying for this trustee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5887)|
| 1:38:12| In 2008, the people of Knox County wrote several Knox County charter amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| They brought those charter amendments to county commission, which rejected them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| Then the people collected signatures during a very hot summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| and forced those charter amendments on the ballot, and they were voted into law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| One of those charter amendments was on conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| It said, you as commissioners cannot nominate a relative to fill a county office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| In the law, you are related to yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| which would imply that you cannot nominate yourself or put your application in for another county position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5923)|
| 1:38:49| Do we need a new charter amendment to define this more clearly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| I'm asking you today to not allow the nomination of a sitting county commissioner to fill the trustee appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5933)|
| 1:38:59| When we vote for a commissioner, we expect them to serve their term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| That is implied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| There's nothing in the oath of office that gives any wiggle room on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| I'm asking you to do the ethical thing and respect the will of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| No more loopholes or technicalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| Just do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| We voted for a person to serve the role of commissioner, and that's what we expect him to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5960)|
| 1:39:27| I am asking you today to select a caretaker for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| The last thing Knox County needs is for a sitting county commissioner to be appointed to the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| and then have a lawsuit and all the trauma that would bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| We've discussed the bonding issues, and that may need to be resolved outside of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| But the voters spoke clearly in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5989)|
| 1:39:53| and I think that what you do today will show us if you respect the will of the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5993)|
| 1:39:58| The easiest way to address this is to postpone and let further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| and further evaluation of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| Thank you so much for your time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| Thank you, Ms. Thatcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| I would like to ask first, have you folks decided when you are going to decide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6021)|
| 1:40:29| I sense you have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| We still have some discussion here about time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| Certainly two weeks was offered, a month's been offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| If it goes to that motion and this sub-motion fails, then we'll discuss that and decide on that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6047)|
| 1:40:48| I'm going to defer my comments until you decide when you are going to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| Thank you, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6056)|
| 1:40:57| I hope you get to decide when we decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6057)|
| 1:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6067)|
| 1:41:09| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| If we were to vote today and did not come to a six number for a candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| and in each term somebody rotates off and then we go back and we postpone it, can that person be re-nominated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6077)|
| 1:41:29| It depends how you postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6089)|
| 1:41:31| If you defer the election because you've run out of steam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| so we'd like to defer the continuation and just continue this election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| Then they're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6098)|
| 1:41:39| If you're not out, you'll continue the election at another day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| If you want to, it's all how you move the motion when you terminate, Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| If you make the motion that we're at an impasse and we would like to start the process all over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6108)|
| 1:41:55| and anybody would be eligible, I mean, it's all on how you handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| Terminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6122)|
| 1:42:03| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| I guess I'm having just a little bit of heartburn over selecting someone with the contingency that if they can't get bonded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6124)|
| 1:42:11| then they can't serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| If I'm sitting out there and I'm not sitting here and that happens and we select someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| and they can't serve because they can't get bonded or there's some credit problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| as a citizen I'm going to say, well, why didn't you vet it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| Why didn't you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| Why did you feel you had to do it today if you knew that this was a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| So I'm trying to put myself, because I am a citizen too, and I'm trying to look at it from both angles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| And so I guess I'm having a little bit of an issue with a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| I mean, I'd like to know that if we vote today that this person is going to be appointed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| they're going to be bonded, they're going to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| so that we don't have to wait and possibly come back and have to do this all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| And so I would like, again, to get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6175)|
| 1:42:58| And if it means that we take a few extra days, the sheriff has said he'll do it for free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| and then the finance director says he can come up with a credit check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| and I don't think anybody would mind doing a credit check because that's one of the issues we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| So, I mean, if we can take a few extra days and get that done and present it to us, I don't see the downside to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6190)|
| 1:43:16| I mean, personally, because, you know, like I say, I can vote today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6196)|
| 1:43:22| but I also want to make sure that we are not setting ourselves up to have another issue come two weeks from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6202)|
| 1:43:31| or a few days from now because if we select someone today, they'll be sworn in today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| and then we go through the bonding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| And if we come in a few days and the bonding people and they can't get bonded and they can't serve, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6218)|
| 1:43:44| then the issue is going to be, well, why didn't you wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| Why didn't you check them out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| And so I guess that's where I'm at is I just kind of like the opportunity to check them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6228)|
| 1:43:53| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6233)|
| 1:43:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I do not disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| I just want to ask, are we going to then reopen 818 because it's got today's date in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6237)|
| 1:44:05| I guess that would be a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| We've approved the procedures for how to select the trustee today using a resolution format, and it's 818.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6251)|
| 1:44:20| It's already passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6260)|
| 1:44:22| We would have to reopen that and put all of the discussion that we're having right now into that 818, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6262)|
| 1:44:30| Yes, if you defer it two-thirds, you can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6270)|
| 1:44:36| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| You know, I'm pretty neutral on whether we delay our vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6279)|
| 1:44:45| I'm kind of like Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| But I guess my question is, I mean, statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6289)|
| 1:44:53| We kind of do this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| I mean, like we talked about with the magistrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| We appoint people and then we issue the bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| I mean, we don't proactively go out and, you know, vet a lot of our people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6302)|
| 1:45:10| I know this is a trustee position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| However, you know, what happens if one gets elected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| Don't have a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| There's a process, and they put their name out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| I mean, to be honest, and it's embarrassing and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6322)|
| 1:45:26| I don't know if that's where people are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| But, you know, once a person says, yea, verily, I wish to seek the office or the appointment of trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| they kind of put themselves out there, and that should be honored if they don't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6333)|
| 1:45:40| get gutted as far as being able to be bonded, then we just move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6340)|
| 1:45:45| I just don't see that as being an insurmountable issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| If there's other reasons, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| But to hold the process up, because it's something that we do all the time, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| you could go to Mr. Wren, who spoke to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| You know, that's kind of the way it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6361)|
| 1:46:04| They tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| They started a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| The test came back, according to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| I'm just recanting what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| The test came back with probably something, and they said, thank you, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| And, yeah, he had started the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| It's painful, but, you know, that's kind of the way this world works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| So, again, I'm okay either way, but, you know, I would like to get us back up and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6383)|
| 1:46:36| And right now, I know, I'm sure Ms. Phillips is capable and able, but she's not the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| She's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| I think we need to get a trustee as soon as possible, and we talk about a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6407)|
| 1:46:53| What would this one-month delay do to a credit rating agency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| Okay, folks in Knox County are putting it off another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| Is that a message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Is it not a message?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| I don't think we can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| I don't think we can say either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| I don't think we knew that this person wasn't going to get bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6427)|
| 1:47:12| You know, so, again, for us to make a drastic decision solely based on whether a person gets bonded or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6432)|
| 1:47:21| I just don't think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| If we want to do it for whatever reason, this body can do that, but I don't think that needs to be the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6443)|
| 1:47:33| Okay, anything else there, Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6453)|
| 1:47:37| Mr. Caldwell, I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| We've gotten down to the issue of qualification, disqualification, and talk about being put on the spot, on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6459)|
| 1:47:51| I guess this is what we're doing to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| You and I have talked about bonded, the issue of bonding some of the candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| The last time we talked, you said or you indicated to me that you thought there was that's a non-issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6482)|
| 1:48:11| that whoever we select, you felt comfortable with us being able to bond them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6491)|
| 1:48:20| And so, if we're at my point in this argument is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6500)|
| 1:48:26| and I don't disagree with more time necessarily being a part of something that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6506)|
| 1:48:31| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6511)|
| 1:48:33| But every single person on this platform has vetted the people or the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6513)|
| 1:48:41| or persons that they're most likely to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6521)|
| 1:48:45| And that's their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| And I think we've done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I don't think we would come to the meeting if we hadn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6529)|
| 1:48:53| So, just to the issue of disqualifying, all right, given all of what's taking place right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6533)|
| 1:49:02| and maybe also to the issue of delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| What do these things do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| Do we have any way to anticipate what these types of things would do in terms of a bonding agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6550)|
| 1:49:19| and how they react to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6559)|
| 1:49:25| First, the disqualification of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| I mean, realistically, we might have five or six or seven people that theoretically could be selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6569)|
| 1:49:40| I mean, when I look at the list, that's what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6580)|
| 1:49:44| And I don't see disqualification being an issue with these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6584)|
| 1:49:52| I would say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6592)|
| 1:49:57| So, our broker says, one of the brokers that we're dealing with says that selection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| they can reasonably assure us that if you select a respectable person that we can be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6605)|
| 1:50:13| Now, you can take that and spin it any way you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| Sure, my gut would tell me that, as I told you, select who you feel is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6621)|
| 1:50:31| And I don't think anybody should be disqualified because you have this concern over a bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6631)|
| 1:50:39| But, you know, it's not up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| It's going to be up to our broker and the underwriter to say this person is bondable or not, because we know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6642)|
| 1:50:50| When you select the next trustee, if they cannot be bonded, then we're back to square one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6650)|
| 1:51:01| And keep in mind, and I've said this for a week now, we were denied our bond not because of Kristen Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6661)|
| 1:51:12| We were denied our bond because of the history of the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6672)|
| 1:51:17| I could make assumptions on why they denied us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6677)|
| 1:51:21| and I think the more information we can give them and provide them, we can make our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6681)|
| 1:51:29| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| I would say not to disqualify anyone and just to select who you think is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6693)|
| 1:51:41| And you think we should bond them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| You think they will be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| Yeah, my head will be on the chopping block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| But, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| What if we delay this until August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| What effect does that have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6718)|
| 1:52:00| What is that effect that you can see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6720)|
| 1:52:04| Can you anticipate any effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| Here's what I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| A delay does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Does it make the comptroller's office nervous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| Yeah, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| But they're probably already nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| The external auditor, will they be nervous?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| They're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6744)|
| 1:52:25| It's just a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6745)|
| 1:52:27| But to me, the key is to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| And if it takes two weeks to get it right, whatever you all think is best is what you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6751)|
| 1:52:38| I'm not the expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| I can guarantee you that the finance department will work with the trustee's office in any way possible to make sure things get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6760)|
| 1:52:49| I'll tell you, Mark Jones busted his rear end last week working on that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| And nobody talks about that, but it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6774)|
| 1:52:58| And he worked with the law department and he worked with me and, of course, with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| And nobody sees that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| But he knows what it's going to take to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| And so when he says, choose a respectable person, and that's what he's being told, that's all we can do is inform you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6788)|
| 1:53:18| And I don't think anybody should be disqualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| I'll get off my soapbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6803)|
| 1:53:24| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6805)|
| 1:53:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| When I turned my light on, I was going to ask a question to make the director of finance say in plain English,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6809)|
| 1:53:38| probably in answer to my question, which is also Commissioner McKenzie's question, what does this do for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6818)|
| 1:53:49| It's not the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| It's the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6831)|
| 1:53:52| It's the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6832)|
| 1:53:53| It's the desk that's having trouble getting bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6833)|
| 1:53:57| It's not the person that's sitting there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6837)|
| 1:53:59| And I believe that's what the bonding agent is telling me when I gather the information about what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6839)|
| 1:54:07| It's not placing the director of finance on the hot seat because the hot seats are all up here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6847)|
| 1:54:14| with the exception of a few here on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| The hot seats are with the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| And we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| We're the only ones that are going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| We're the ones that have to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| So if it's not the people that are standing before us today that are causing the bonding issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| it's Knox County that's causing the bonding issue because of our past history in that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6874)|
| 1:54:41| not the person that's going to go fill it here tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6881)|
| 1:54:49| Because if you've heard what I've had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| I think it ought to be someone that can leave here this afternoon and find that desk tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6892)|
| 1:54:57| and get on with the business of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| Then the other half of what I think I just collected is the fact that it does make some people uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6902)|
| 1:55:10| if we start moving this down the road for another four weeks or even another two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| Because even when we get to the end of two weeks or four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| we still don't know if the person we really accepted or appointed is one that can be bonded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| I mean, we may have a feel for that because we've done background checks or credit checks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| but we still don't know any more about that person than we really might know today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| I'm 55-45 toward let's move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6939)|
| 1:55:46| Thank you, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6947)|
| 1:55:49| Mr. Chairman and Commissioners, I want to remind us of one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6949)|
| 1:55:52| We're talking about the Hartford Insurance Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6952)|
| 1:55:55| That's one insurance company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| Ladies and gentlemen, there are thousands of insurance companies out there, thousands of insurance companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| And they'll fight for our business, try to get our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| And I have every confidence in Chris Caldwell, Mark Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6963)|
| 1:56:08| Folks, here's what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Here's what our underwriting process is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| And then the underwriters will take it and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6972)|
| 1:56:14| But there's thousands of companies besides just the Hartford that can look at us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6974)|
| 1:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6983)|
| 1:56:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6985)|
| 1:56:26| We have before us a substitute motion to proceed with our selection process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6986)|
| 1:56:30| as we have reviewed in resolution with the additional caveat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6990)|
| 1:56:39| that it be contingent upon the ability to bond the person selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=6999)|
| 1:56:45| Is that understood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7008)|

| 1:57:44| Commissioner McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7064)|
| 1:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7074)|
| 1:57:56| Substitute motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| So we will proceed with our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7081)|
| 1:58:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| We have made a sort of made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| I congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| Are you ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| We won't take a break on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| We're not going to break on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7099)|
| 1:58:21| Go ahead, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7101)|
| 1:58:22| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| Name and address and get a little closer there, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| Today, Knox County stands at the fork of a road, and you, our county commissioners, have your hands on the tiller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| Your choices are simple and distinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| One, you can steer Knox County back to the days of political cronyism via the good old boy system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7124)|
| 1:58:53| or you can appoint an interim trustee who has had no association whatsoever with the past trustees, administrations that have embarrassed us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7133)|
| 1:59:04| That appointment should be as apolitical as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7144)|
| 1:59:10| Knox County needs such apolitical stewardship of this office during the next 14 months as county government continues to rebuild credibility and to regain trust of our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7150)|
| 1:59:25| Recognize Hartford's query for what it was, a salient and timely warning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7165)|
| 1:59:33| Business as usual under the GOB system will be recognized for what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| perpetuation of the self-centered consolidation and concentration of power among the city-county building circuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7179)|
| 1:59:48| Folks, recognize the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| Now is the opportunity for statesmen of Knox County to distinguish themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7191)|
| 1:59:58| and statesmen who are sufficiently confident in their qualifications and abilities to make their case to the electorate still have time to withdraw from this appointment-feeding frenzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7198)|
| 2:00:13| Such statesmen will be positioned to present their cases to voters on an even playing field in an equitable election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7213)|
| 2:00:23| That is what will bring out the best of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Thank you, Mr. Andrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7229)|
| 2:00:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| Now we're at the point in the process where we open the floor for nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| From the floor, do we have any nominee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7249)|
| 2:00:50| I mean open the floor for recommendations towards nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7250)|
| 2:00:55| Mr. Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7255)|
| 2:00:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| I've kept quiet this last 45 minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| I've had an opinion or two, but I didn't think it proper that I start editorializing my point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7261)|
| 2:01:07| I did support the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| I think I don't see a harm in credit checks and background checks and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7269)|
| 2:01:15| But the body has decided to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| You know, this thing, we've been going through this for 21 days now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| I think it hit three weeks ago today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| And I had a lot of people just contact me and say, I think you'd be good for that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7284)|
| 2:01:29| People that have supported me in the past and people that haven't necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7289)|
| 2:01:33| And I thought about it and, you know, thought, well, what's the harm in putting my name in the hat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7293)|
| 2:01:40| I enjoy numbers and enjoy that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| And I've been a trustee, not in a public environment in my past, but for a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| And so I work with big numbers and have a history in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| But, nevertheless, I keep hearing the, and I respect what Ms. Apsher and Mr. Anderson and others have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7310)|
| 2:01:56| I did hear a few people on talk radio here and there saying things similar to what they have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7316)|
| 2:02:03| And I certainly respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| I know I worked very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| Bud and I fought it out actually three years ago, and we're very good friends now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| We were then, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7331)|
| 2:02:12| But to win a seat in one of the newly created at-large seats running in 93 precincts is a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7332)|
| 2:02:22| Let me state that emphatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| But getting back to the subject, I keep hearing insider, insider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7345)|
| 2:02:31| I guess I'm perceived as an insider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| There are two former commissioners applying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| They're insiders, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7358)|
| 2:02:40| There are two other people who worked for the trustee's office in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| I assume they're insiders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I don't know if that's the eye of the beholder, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7365)|
| 2:02:49| So, the more I think about it, the vast majority of people I have asked about this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7369)|
| 2:02:57| in the courthouse, at my church, grocery store, at the bank, walking up and down Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7377)|
| 2:03:02| say, we think you'd be great for that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| We hope you get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| I've heard it today a dozen times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| Hope you get that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| But looking at what this county went through six, seven years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7390)|
| 2:03:17| and I'm thinking about Black Wednesday, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| but now we know stuff going on prior to that, ghost employees, fake title searches, fake surveys, who knows what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7399)|
| 2:03:29| and the unfortunate things in the Duncan office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| Looking at what we went through, I have a hard time keeping myself in this race.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7412)|
| 2:03:40| Although I think I'm qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7420)|
| 2:03:42| I won't say I'm better than these other guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7422)|
| 2:03:44| I would say I'm as good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7424)|
| 2:03:46| I'm honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7426)|
| 2:03:47| Run all the credit checks and background checks you want to on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| I think it will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| But having said those things, I think it's just probably more equitable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| and probably more fair to the citizens of Knox County who put me in this seat, which I love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7439)|
| 2:04:05| to take my name out of the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| It's pretty difficult because I think I'd do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| But having said that, if I take my name out, Mr. Law Director, I can sit here and vote, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7452)|
| 2:04:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| You're a commissioner with all the eligible credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| We had a conversation Saturday at the event at Fountain City, and he told me I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7466)|
| 2:04:31| and he interpreted the statute, the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| and also the document we just passed an hour or so ago about the procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| I would actually get up and walk out in the audience and not be party to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| So I will just formally say don't nominate me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| I will take my name out of contention for this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| Regrettably, I think I would do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7495)|
| 2:04:57| I would like to have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7497)|
| 2:04:59| And to further that, the primary is only eight months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7499)|
| 2:05:07| So maybe let's put it like it should be, and all of us insiders just look towards next April's primary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7507)|
| 2:05:19| and we can let the voters of Knox County settle the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| And I would assure you I'm looking at it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| So I will be voting for someone who we're calling a placekeeper that I feel is qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7525)|
| 2:05:35| I would have liked to have had some documentation on a couple of the placekeepers I intend to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7535)|
| 2:05:42| but I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| So I do have some good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| I've gone through the 80, 100 pages of resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| I have some good ideas who I will support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| But I will be, I'll state I will be supporting someone who I think is totally qualified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7554)|
| 2:05:59| but will unfortunately will not have the continuity to move this office forward after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7559)|
| 2:06:04| But nevertheless, it's a great opportunity for someone to come in and do a lot of hard work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7564)|
| 2:06:10| and make a lot of hard decisions and hopefully put that office where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| So I'll shut up my editorializing and try to figure out exactly who I plan to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7583)|
| 2:06:27| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7587)|
| 2:06:28| Hold on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| I just wanted to make a statement on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| I think that that really speaks a lot to the character of Ed Shouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| and I know that took a lot of courage and soul searching to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7597)|
| 2:06:43| And I think it also says a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| We have a lot of other good candidates on this, but that really says a lot about you and your character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7605)|
| 2:06:51| And, you know, it means a lot to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7611)|
| 2:06:55| The statement that I really wanted to make dealt with the employees of the trustee's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7615)|
| 2:07:01| because we're hearing a lot like we need to send someone in to clean up the corruption there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7621)|
| 2:07:06| or there's a problem in that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| And I think we really ought to make clear that the problem has not been the employees of the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| but the problem has been the office holders that were elected there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| There's many loyal, dedicated employees who should not be condemned as corrupt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7639)|
| 2:07:27| because the office holders that were placed by the citizens as their bosses had problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7647)|
| 2:07:36| There's been two TBI investigations into that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7656)|
| 2:07:40| One on an office holder that had been there, I believe, since 1994,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7660)|
| 2:07:44| and then the other most recent that we're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| And I think after a thorough investigation by the TBI,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| if there were other people in that office who were involved in something wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7670)|
| 2:07:54| it would have been found out after two investigations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| I don't think we should condemn the people or tarnish their reputations that have worked there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| but I think they should actually be commended that in spite of everything that's gone on, they've stayed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7683)|
| 2:08:09| they've been loyal, they've worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| and they've served the taxpayers in spite of the people that have been elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7691)|
| 2:08:19| And I just wanted to make that statement because I know many of the people that work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| have been just as upset over what's happened in their office as much as many of the voters have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7703)|
| 2:08:31| And in spite of all of that, they've done their jobs, the office is still working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7711)|
| 2:08:36| and it will continue to work because of those loyal and dedicated employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7716)|
| 2:08:42| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7722)|
| 2:08:43| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7725)|
| 2:08:46| You know, I wasn't going to necessarily comment on this, but it's very frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7726)|
| 2:08:53| So I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| Well, one, I'd like to say I'll agree with what Commissioner Briggs said, Commissioner Schall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7735)|
| 2:09:02| I'm sure you really, really wanted that job or you wouldn't put your name into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| So I do applaud you for making your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7747)|
| 2:09:15| But what I want to talk about is this whole notion of good old boy network cronyism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| I'm sick of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7761)|
| 2:09:23| Hadn't happened in my five years plus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| Okay, quit comparing this commission to commissions of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7766)|
| 2:09:30| We have done an excellent job of keeping things transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7770)|
| 2:09:36| So folks coming up here acting like we're all relatives so we can't vote against each other, you know, it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7776)|
| 2:09:43| It's just not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7783)|
| 2:09:44| And so quit trying to force us to make decisions over something that happened a decade ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7784)|
| 2:09:51| That's just, with my votes and my process, that's just not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7791)|
| 2:09:56| You know, the whole thing of a placeholder to me speaks of, well, we don't trust commission to do the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7796)|
| 2:10:03| so we just put someone in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7803)|
| 2:10:05| Quit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7805)|
| 2:10:06| That's not the commission and the commissioners that you voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7806)|
| 2:10:11| We've not conspired on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| You all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7814)|
| 2:10:15| You all realize, and I'm speaking to the public generally, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| and so I do think we have restored the public's trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| We will continue to build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7825)|
| 2:10:27| But we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| So, but it's kind of like you still have to keep looking over your shoulder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7829)|
| 2:10:33| And that's okay to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7833)|
| 2:10:35| But not to a point that we're not effectively doing what we were elected to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7835)|
| 2:10:39| We were elected to make some tough, tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| This decision to not delay this was extremely tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| But I feel it was for the right reasons, not for anyone in my ear or anything like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7847)|
| 2:10:52| but me as a sitting commissioner representing the people of the first district, I think it's time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7852)|
| 2:10:57| So that's why I made the decision to do it, not because of any underhanded deal going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| And, you know, so for that to continually be put forward to a point that people wanted to affect our votes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7863)|
| 2:11:11| and our processes, hopefully that won't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7871)|
| 2:11:14| It won't happen with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| And hopefully it won't happen with us as a body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| So, you know, I guess my last thing, this whole notion of an incumbent having some kind of advantage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7881)|
| 2:11:29| I really think those days are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| We look at our law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7892)|
| 2:11:33| I mean, you know, a law director ran against an appointed incumbent and lost, the incumbent lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7893)|
| 2:11:42| So, you know, you look at the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| I think our voters are more informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7905)|
| 2:11:48| They're voting on the issues, partisan or not, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7908)|
| 2:11:52| They're voting on the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| They're voting on what they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7914)|
| 2:11:56| They're not just going down, clicking incumbent, incumbent, incumbent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| That just doesn't happen anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| But let's celebrate that and not keep reliving, you know, the distant past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7921)|
| 2:12:07| So that's just, I wanted to say that going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7927)|
| 2:12:11| And I'm confident that this nomination process will be an open and genuine one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7931)|
| 2:12:18| I know there's been no backroom deals there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7938)|
| 2:12:21| So that's just really frustrating to continually be accused of that when it's just flat out not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7941)|
| 2:12:29| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| Thank you, Commissioner McKenzie, for expressing in several words more eloquently than I might about the status of commission right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7954)|
| 2:12:46| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| Also, Dr. Briggs, the office of the trustee has been stained by ghost employees or $3,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7967)|
| 2:13:01| I really appreciate your comments to the office continues to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7981)|
| 2:13:08| As in all offices, there's always room for incremental improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| And I think the employees have driven that over the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7993)|
| 2:13:18| Really, the reason I had my light on was to commend Commissioner Schaust on the action that he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=7998)|
| 2:13:31| He ran an excellent, well, no, I shouldn't say that, countywide race because he won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8011)|
| 2:13:41| As tongue-in-cheek, I want to say, though, that I feel like that Commissioner Schaust has an excellent background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8021)|
| 2:13:53| His reputation here on commission has been to try to get the big picture, which is what the at-large commissioner should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8033)|
| 2:14:00| And I want to publicly thank him for taking the position that he has, collecting all the information and dealing with it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8040)|
| 2:14:10| I guess it goes back to anything can happen until nominations cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8050)|
| 2:14:18| And I appreciate what you've done, Commissioner Schaust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8058)|
| 2:14:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8062)|
| 2:14:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8065)|
| 2:14:26| Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8066)|
| 2:14:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8068)|
| 2:14:29| I, too, want to commend Commissioner Schaust for the position he's taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| It is rare that you see someone put the public interest above their own personal interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| He has done that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| He has put the public's interest above his own, and I applaud that and thank him for it and admire him for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8078)|
| 2:14:44| And I do hope that he will put his name in nomination for trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| If he doesn't, I hope he'll come back on this body because I think the county needs him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| or someone like him who has the financial background that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8092)|
| 2:14:55| So, Ed, best of luck to you as you continue and think about what you want to do for your political future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| I'm ready to make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| I don't know what the procedure is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| And I would like to have an opportunity to explain why I am making a nomination when that time comes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8105)|
| 2:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| We've got some people that have moist eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8115)|
| 2:15:17| And so not because they're crying, but because they've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8117)|
| 2:15:22| And so we're going to take five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8122)|
| 2:15:25| and then we're back into this same portion of the process, five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8125)|
| 2:15:45| Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8145)|
| 2:15:47| Please have a seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8147)|
| 2:15:49| We're in the portion of our procedure where we're still taking recommendations from the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8149)|
| 2:15:55| Are there any further recommendations from the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8155)|
| 2:15:58| Anybody in the audience like to speak or recommend from the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8158)|
| 2:16:08| Seeing there is none, we'll move on to the next part of the process where we accept nominations from the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8168)|
| 2:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8177)|
| 2:16:18| Now, we'll begin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| Do we need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8183)|
| 2:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8189)|
| 2:16:30| We're going to start in the first district with Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8190)|
| 2:16:33| I'd like to nominate Frank D. Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| He was the gentleman that actually sent us an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8196)|
| 2:16:41| Sent it to us individually, but I don't think he sent it to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| But it was in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8205)|
| 2:16:47| I am extremely confident that Mr. Robinson has the pedigree to pass whatever background, investigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8207)|
| 2:16:57| financial, criminal that can be passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| And also, I've seen his body of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8220)|
| 2:17:03| Extremely hardworking individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8223)|
| 2:17:05| So I'd like to enter Frank Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8227)|
| 2:17:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8228)|
| 2:17:09| Ms. Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| Yes, I would like to nominate Mike Manning for trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| I was very impressed with him during his interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8235)|
| 2:17:17| I've looked at his resume and his work, and I think he's absolutely excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8237)|
| 2:17:26| Can we make comments at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| My feeling, and I also tremendously respect Ed Schaus and would have very much liked to see Ed be trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8252)|
| 2:17:41| but I felt like I would have been unable to vote for Ed in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8261)|
| 2:17:48| I feel like there are several good people out of the trustee's office who would make excellent trustees as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8268)|
| 2:17:58| but I feel like this issue of regaining the public's trust in the trustee's office is critical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8278)|
| 2:18:07| and I think anyone who has worked in the trustee's office under Duncan III or under Mike Lowe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8287)|
| 2:18:17| this is not to say they had anything to do with anything that happened there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8297)|
| 2:18:21| because I don't believe that they did, far from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8301)|
| 2:18:25| But in the public's mind, I think that creates a barrier to trust if we bring in someone who served in the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8305)|
| 2:18:34| under either of those two trustees, so I'm unable to support those candidates as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| I think that a clean break and a new face is what the public will be most receptive to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8321)|
| 2:18:52| and fortunately, there are a lot of people who turned in great resumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8332)|
| 2:18:57| There are a number of people who I think can do this job and do it in a very excellent manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8337)|
| 2:19:03| I know from my work on the Audit Committee, we mentioned that, you know, tax notices go out in October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8343)|
| 2:19:10| and the peering company, the external auditor, is going to come in next month and work with the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| and those things, frankly, are handled by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8357)|
| 2:19:22| The trustee is not involved in day-to-day operations with the external auditor or in sending out tax notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8362)|
| 2:19:31| So I think we need someone with incredibly good financial background and excellent management skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8371)|
| 2:19:40| whose reputation is above approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8380)|
| 2:19:44| And so that's why I'm supporting Mike Manning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8384)|
| 2:19:48| Thank you, Ms. Broyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| Mr. Orlandi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8389)|
| 2:19:51| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8391)|
| 2:19:53| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8393)|
| 2:19:55| I'm going to --I'd like to nominate a person that I think we can put into the office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| and have no question about his ethics, about his understanding of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8402)|
| 2:20:08| and can run the office with complete trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8408)|
| 2:20:12| The way that you gain trust is not through being an outsider, but by being honest and running the office right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8412)|
| 2:20:22| This is not the first time that I've recognized this person for who I know he is, which is a very honest person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8422)|
| 2:20:30| I nominated him twice to be chairman of this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8430)|
| 2:20:33| and I voted for him to be the chairman of our Charter Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8433)|
| 2:20:39| And I'd like to put the name of Craig Lutho forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8442)|
| 2:20:43| Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8443)|
| 2:20:44| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8445)|
| 2:20:47| Mr. Schaus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| I'm sorry, Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8449)|
| 2:20:53| Well, I was going to make the nomination of Mike Manning, and I, too, will make a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8453)|
| 2:20:58| I don't know of any other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8458)|
| 2:21:02| You know, the letter from the insurance company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8462)|
| 2:21:05| some of the arguments that were just made is, you know, we're talking about the bonding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8465)|
| 2:21:11| But the letter of the insurance company to the county said the actions of past employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8471)|
| 2:21:17| And I don't know anybody, and I don't know Fred Sisk, Mr. Curtis, Mr. Lutho.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8477)|
| 2:21:23| They're all high in character, and they're all great people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8483)|
| 2:21:26| But I think that we need to be very careful in appointing somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8486)|
| 2:21:31| that's potentially going to testify in a lawsuit or in a criminal proceeding next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8491)|
| 2:21:36| as former employees of the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8496)|
| 2:21:42| And so that's we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| I'm going caretaker, and I'm going with Mike Manning on my votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| But he's already been nominated, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| Mr. Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8511)|
| 2:21:53| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8516)|
| 2:21:57| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8517)|
| 2:21:59| My candidate has also been nominated as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8519)|
| 2:22:03| I'm going to be going the caretaker route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8523)|
| 2:22:05| I've been very vocal about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8525)|
| 2:22:06| I feel like that we need someone that's going to be laser focused on that office for the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8526)|
| 2:22:11| until August 31st of next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| Being involved in the political spectrum, knowing what it takes to raise money, to campaign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8534)|
| 2:22:19| to do all of the things that you need to do to be elected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8539)|
| 2:22:22| that would take away, from my point of view, what needs to happen right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8542)|
| 2:22:26| And I agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8546)|
| 2:22:28| The people that go to work every day, they've been tainted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Knox County government has been tainted by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| And I think that people are looking to us to do something to get that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| And so I hope that and I know that we will by making our choice today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| But I will be voting for the caretaker for that reason, not that these other people are not qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8564)|
| 2:22:49| I look forward to a spirited campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8569)|
| 2:22:51| They can pick up their nominations and paperwork in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| The prime areas are just eight months away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8576)|
| 2:22:58| And so that gives people an opportunity to really go out and to take their case to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8585)|
| 2:23:06| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8586)|
| 2:23:17| The body, I'll take my turn in nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8597)|
| 2:23:20| And I would like to nominate Bill Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8600)|
| 2:23:23| Also, for the similar reasons that have already been expressed about the caretaker role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8603)|
| 2:23:29| And in my process of inquiry about Mr. Curtis, I find him to be beyond repute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8609)|
| 2:23:39| and the type of person that we need for this office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8619)|
| 2:23:42| He will leave this office, according to people inside county government and outside county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8622)|
| 2:23:49| He is an outstanding financial manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8629)|
| 2:23:52| And he will leave this office in excellent shape for whoever is to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8632)|
| 2:23:58| So it's my honor to nominate William Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8638)|
| 2:24:03| Now, does the pass wish to nominate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8643)|
| 2:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8654)|
| 2:24:15| Do I hear a motion that nomination cease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8655)|
| 2:24:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8658)|
| 2:24:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8659)|
| 2:24:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8661)|
| 2:24:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8663)|
| 2:24:24| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8664)|
| 2:24:25| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8665)|
| 2:24:26| Mr. Chairman, could we go over the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8666)|
| 2:24:28| You may want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8668)|
| 2:24:30| I would just like to have a refresher on how we're going to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| I'm stepping through the script right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8674)|
| 2:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| So if I misstep, I've got a guy poking me right next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Of course, the process will be essentially we'll vote on those nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8683)|
| 2:24:50| The low vote getter or the low total or totals will be bumped off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8690)|
| 2:24:57| and then we'll resume voting in the next round with the remaining nominees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8697)|
| 2:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8704)|
| 2:25:05| That's essentially it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| And the magic number is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| And the magic number is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| All the nominees are present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8712)|
| 2:25:14| Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8714)|
| 2:25:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Are all the nominees willing to accept the nomination?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8721)|
| 2:25:24| And if elected, willing to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8724)|
| 2:25:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8728)|
| 2:25:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8730)|
| 2:25:32| And let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8732)|
| 2:25:35| I'm looking to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8735)|
| 2:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| Frank Robinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8742)|
| 2:25:43| I'm just looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| He was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8744)|
| 2:25:45| I didn't see Frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8745)|
| 2:25:47| He was here earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8747)|
| 2:25:48| I don't see him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8748)|
| 2:25:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8753)|
| 2:25:54| Frank has to be present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8754)|
| 2:25:55| or he has to have a written acceptance of the nomination and his willingness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8755)|
| 2:26:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8762)|
| 2:26:03| Why don't we just do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8763)|
| 2:26:05| If you would stand and say yes to this inquiry, give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8765)|
| 2:26:13| And, yeah, just come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| Mr. Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8778)|
| 2:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8779)|
| 2:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8780)|
| 2:26:22| Mr. Manning, give your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8782)|
| 2:26:25| Mike Manning, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| Thank you, Mr. Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8789)|
| 2:26:33| Frank Leuthold, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8793)|
| 2:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| Mr. Chair, I don't know if it's appropriate at this point with Mr. Robinson not being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| I will withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8800)|
| 2:26:42| I don't know if that's appropriate if we've already certified the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8802)|
| 2:26:45| But I'll withdraw his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8805)|
| 2:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8808)|
| 2:26:58| Is there any further discussion of the nominees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8818)|
| 2:27:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8824)|
| 2:27:05| And I'll just read again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| Each commissioner shall vote for only one nominee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8826)|
| 2:27:08| After each round, the nominee with the lowest vote will be dropped from the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8828)|
| 2:27:13| When two win and if two remain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8833)|
| 2:27:17| the voting will continue until one receives a majority of the eligible votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=8837)|

| 2:31:47| and my youngest son, Craig, who's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9107)|

| 2:32:11| and we're going to build the trust back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9131)|
| 2:32:13| I know someone said, I said that to someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9133)|
| 2:32:15| and someone said, you're borrowing Coach Jones' philosophy to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9135)|

| 2:35:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9352)|
| 2:36:21| Okay, Madam Clerk, back in session now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9381)|
| 2:36:23| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9383)|
| 2:36:25| Page five, resolution 201, approving a grant agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9385)|
| 2:36:30| and the amount of $840,000 requires a local match of $360,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| which will be split equally between Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| and the Great Schools Partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9398)|
| 2:36:42| local match funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9402)|
| 2:36:48| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9408)|
| 2:36:49| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| I guess the only discussion is why is this before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| I know we customarily, if there's a nay vote, that we'll pull it off consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9415)|
| 2:37:01| but I think with the way we've agreed to deal with the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| if we had questions we would bring those up during the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9426)|
| 2:37:10| and vet those, but those things automatically go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9430)|
| 2:37:13| So I guess my question is why this one is appearing before us at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9433)|
| 2:37:17| regularly scheduled meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9437)|
| 2:37:21| Okay, would anybody like to respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9441)|
| 2:37:27| Well, it wasn't on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9447)|
| 2:37:29| It couldn't be pulled from consent because it wasn't on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9449)|
| 2:37:33| So if there is a negative vote, one no vote, then it is not allowed to go to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9453)|
| 2:37:40| I guess my question is, is education consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9460)|
| 2:37:45| That's what it's titled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9465)|
| 2:37:47| Okay, so education is consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9467)|
| 2:37:50| So that's the agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| And so I do appreciate and it should be an expectation that we can ask these questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9473)|
| 2:38:02| but all that should happen at the work session, but the actual vote is a consent vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9482)|
| 2:38:08| which is, again, when we set this work session slash commission meeting up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9488)|
| 2:38:13| that's why we did that, so that we could vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9493)|
| 2:38:18| But we have education consent, and then we build a consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| And so, to me, these educational issues shouldn't be vetted at this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| but the one the third Monday in the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9509)|
| 2:38:33| I guess I'll ask the law director if that is, in fact, the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9513)|
| 2:38:42| The answer is yes and no, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9522)|
| 2:38:47| Under the agreement, the agreement states that something may not be pulled from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9527)|
| 2:38:52| That's the agreement that county commission made in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9532)|
| 2:38:56| Under the rules, the workshop establishes consent, whether it's a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9536)|
| 2:39:02| whether it's purchasing, whether it's anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| A consent calendar is established by rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9545)|
| 2:39:09| Also, under the statute, this is an appropriated item because you must vote on receiving a grant with a match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9549)|
| 2:39:18| which makes it a special event, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| So just kind of by default, because there was a negative vote under the rules, it wasn't put on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9562)|
| 2:39:31| And it just is where it is, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| Commission makes the rules, and that's where we find ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9574)|
| 2:39:39| I couldn't have advised you otherwise because I'm just giving you what your rules are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9579)|
| 2:39:42| So I guess a question, and I'll look to former Chairman Hammond to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9582)|
| 2:39:48| When we first set up this process, when we went from intergovernmental on finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9588)|
| 2:39:52| and I know you weren't in that seat at the time, but we may want to do a review over the minutes on our votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9592)|
| 2:39:59| I'm pretty sure that that's what we decided upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| I don't know whether formal vote or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9602)|
| 2:40:03| but we decided upon the fact that we would ask the superintendent and his staff questions at the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9603)|
| 2:40:11| and then we would not pull things off consent at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| So, Commissioner Hammond, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9616)|
| 2:40:18| That was the agreement that we had when we met at our retreat, and we talked about this whole notion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9618)|
| 2:40:23| and we agreed that any questions we had would come at the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| but after that everything would just be passed on education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9627)|
| 2:40:31| Now, whether that was formalized in writing, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| but that was the agreement that we had at our retreat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| and that's how we had been progressing with that understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9637)|
| 2:40:44| And my reasons for going on and on with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9644)|
| 2:40:46| oh, yes, sure, the superintendent can answer these one or two questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| but, you know, today he's been here, you know, probably, you know, two and a half hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9648)|
| 2:40:54| As things go on, I mean, you know, we're paying him a pretty good sum per hour, you know, to do his job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| and I would rather him be here for a set amount of time at a prescribed hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9660)|
| 2:41:06| and not necessarily have to spend as much time here at this meeting to probably answer questions he's already answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9666)|
| 2:41:14| So that's my concern going forward, that we're just holding, and not just him and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9674)|
| 2:41:21| I mean, this isn't a cheap two and a half hours for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9681)|
| 2:41:27| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9687)|
| 2:41:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9695)|
| 2:41:41| Page seven, resolution 205,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| approving a contract in the amount of $1,200,000 with the Parthenon Group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9704)|
| 2:41:48| to provide professional services in support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grant to access resource alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9708)|
| 2:41:54| and effective implementation of instructional reforms funded in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9714)|
| 2:42:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9724)|
| 2:42:08| So is Dr. McIntyre still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| Is he still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9731)|
| 2:42:18| Dr. McIntyre, I'll just, because you're here, I'm going to ask you a question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| just so your visit was not completely in vain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9741)|
| 2:42:30| And I had before, and thank you for being here, and thank you for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9750)|
| 2:42:36| And I truly believe that whatever will come to some agreement about this consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9756)|
| 2:42:44| consent menu agenda, but it's not, it's certainly not my intent to harass you or anybody else on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9764)|
| 2:42:53| I mean, it's just another place to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9773)|
| 2:42:56| And I had one question last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9776)|
| 2:42:58| It was the only thing I had about Parthenon was relative to teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9778)|
| 2:43:04| And you had responded that there was no credible teacher morale survey that really existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9784)|
| 2:43:12| that you thought would be of benefit to the system or something to that effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9792)|
| 2:43:18| Could you respond to that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9798)|
| 2:43:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9800)|
| 2:43:21| You know, my only, I think my response was something to the effect of I'm not aware of any quantifiable indicator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9801)|
| 2:43:28| or quantifiable instrument to measure teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| I think people talk a lot about teacher morale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| but I'm not aware of a specific instrument that is research-based that is purported to accurately measure teacher morale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9814)|
| 2:43:44| And that was my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9824)|
| 2:43:46| I think we do a lot to try to get a sense of where our teachers are in terms of things like surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9826)|
| 2:43:53| and I think I mentioned last time the TELL survey, which is a survey that the state of Tennessee conducts biannually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9833)|
| 2:43:59| to get a pulse of where our teachers are and what their thoughts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9839)|
| 2:44:03| We're about to kick off a probably six- to eight-month process of developing our next five-year strategic plan for the Knox County schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9843)|
| 2:44:12| and that will entail a lot of conversations and dialogue with teachers that will help us really understand where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9852)|
| 2:44:20| and what their perspectives are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| I periodically hold what I call teacher talk meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9862)|
| 2:44:26| which are small gatherings of teachers in different regions around the county to talk with teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9866)|
| 2:44:33| invite them to provide their feedback and their input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| let us know how they're doing and what their thoughts are on some of the changes that are happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9876)|
| 2:44:40| and some of the improvements and initiatives that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| And then we also do a series of public forums and invite teachers to come and provide input in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9883)|
| 2:44:50| So that's not to say there isn't a lot of ways that we can solicit input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| and hear the perspective of teachers and value their perspective of teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| We try very much to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9899)|
| 2:45:00| I'm just not aware of a specific instrument that really purports to, in a research-based way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9900)|
| 2:45:06| measure teacher morale as a quantifiable indicator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| But if we could find something like that in the process of using Parthenon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9910)|
| 2:45:15| you wouldn't be against possibly looking at it or seeing if it's applicable to our situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9915)|
| 2:45:21| We'd certainly give that consideration, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| That's all I wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9925)|
| 2:45:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9926)|
| 2:45:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=9927)|
