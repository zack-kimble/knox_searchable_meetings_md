| 2:39:39| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9579)|
| 2:39:40| Is there a motion to approve plus the red line items or with those amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9580)|
| 2:39:52| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9592)|
| 2:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9593)|
| 2:39:54| On first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| By Commissioner Frazier with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9598)|
| 2:40:01| Commissioner, excuse me, Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9601)|
| 2:40:05| To be really brief, I can tell that you all are very tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| First, Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| I want to, A, thank Ms. Poitier and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| They did a really great job writing this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9618)|
| 2:40:20| These are some standards for drive-ins and drive-thru uses and some others that are really great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9620)|
| 2:40:27| And I know they researched the heck out of it and came up with some stuff I hadn't seen before, and I was really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| So that's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9632)|
| 2:40:34| The other thing is this all comes out of the Alcoa Highway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9634)|
| 2:40:37| So this actually represents us implementing some things for one of our plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9637)|
| 2:40:42| So this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9642)|
| 2:40:44| So a lot of positive kudos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9644)|
| 2:40:48| We dug through the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9648)|
| 2:40:50| I did talk a little bit with staff prior to this coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9650)|
| 2:40:54| The CA zone that talks about some use by right for drive-thru uses as well as the CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9654)|
| 2:41:00| And it talks about tying those to particular road classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| And one of the biggest things we looked at, as we said, there's a lot of CA property around the county that's in the more outskirt areas that are on, like, minor arterial roads, which, as originally written, would have been a use by right for a drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9663)|
| 2:41:18| And so when you start looking at those properties, like, those people living next to it don't know that that would be a use by right for a drive-thru, for a bank or a restaurant or the 24-hour taco bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9678)|
| 2:41:28| So that was one of our main concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9688)|
| 2:41:30| So that's the main crux of the red line that we submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9697)|
| 2:41:38| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| Ms. Brooks and Mr. Snowden, do you all have any concerns with the red line proposed amendments to what's on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9701)|
| 2:41:54| I certainly will, Amy, weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9714)|
| 2:41:56| But I think Kevin makes some really good points about the arterial and some of those minor arterials may not be as appropriate as what they appear to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9716)|
| 2:42:06| I do have a concern, though, with the hour requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9726)|
| 2:42:12| That could be a problem practically for my department to enforce if, you know, I don't know exactly what were the hours that may be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9732)|
| 2:42:21| But if they were to be set, you know, I mean, obviously my department works, you know, through the week and, you know, normal business hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9741)|
| 2:42:30| You know, some of those hours that, you know, a drive-thru may be open late in the afternoon or late in the evening would be problematic for me to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9750)|
| 2:42:39| Do you also have concerns enforcing, I mean, one of the red lines on Exhibit A, C6, it's about placing stacking spaces, lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9759)|
| 2:42:53| and it talks about idling vehicles that tend to produce noise and fumes that could cross the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9773)|
| 2:43:02| I mean, I guess it's enforcing, it's placing a restriction on the number of lanes, but it's, again, it's getting into enforcement of fumes and noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9782)|
| 2:43:17| I looked at that. I think what Kevin was talking about was just trying to avoid that, I guess, that dry vial debate where you reposition the side a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9797)|
| 2:43:26| I think, you know, I don't want to speak for Amy, but I think, you know, through our plans review process, we could possibly mitigate some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9806)|
| 2:43:34| So, my concerns are just the hours. I mean, I understand the, you know, the concern that Kevin has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9814)|
| 2:43:41| but I don't know how practically my department can enforce some of those things that, you know, some of those hours that they may be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9821)|
| 2:43:57| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9837)|
| 2:44:00| Thank you, Madam Chair. Jim, Amy, Michelle, this is first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9840)|
| 2:44:08| and I understand it's going to be hard to enforce the hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9848)|
| 2:44:12| So, Commissioner Frazier could make a midterm motion to get rid of the hour part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9852)|
| 2:44:19| or we can come back next month and get rid of the hours part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9859)|
| 2:44:24| or if there's anything else that you two know of that you've really got concerns about, we need to go ahead and get it done tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9864)|
| 2:44:31| so we'll be ready next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9871)|
| 2:44:38| Neither myself or Ms. Porche have any other concerns beyond the one that was highlighted by Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9878)|
| 2:44:47| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9887)|
| 2:44:49| And it does state Planning Commission may impose. It does not state will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9889)|
| 2:45:00| So, the language is, I mean, I'm, yeah, I mean, I'm happy to amend my motion, but it does say may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9900)|
| 2:45:12| So, are you, sorry, are you going to amend your motion, or are you just going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9912)|
| 2:45:18| Well, we can continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9918)|
| 2:45:21| Okay, if you're not ready, I'll just leave it as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9921)|
| 2:45:23| Yeah, I just, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9923)|
| 2:45:24| Commissioner Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9924)|
| 2:45:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| I just wanted to make the same suggestion, but really, if we pass the motion as is on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9927)|
| 2:45:35| just tweaking that little bit of language surely would not constitute a, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9935)|
| 2:45:40| Great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9940)|
| 2:45:41| So, I would urge my colleagues to support this on first reading as the motion reads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9941)|
| 2:45:47| Great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| And I'm going to say there's no more discussion. I don't see any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9950)|
| 2:45:54| So, the motion on the floor is to approve with red line copy by Commissioner Frazier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9954)|
| 2:46:02| with a second by Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9964)|
| 2:46:05| Actually, we have to do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9965)|
| 2:46:09| I was on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9969)|
| 2:46:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230221-zoning?start=9970)|
