|   555    |   566    | Our teachers, our teacher assistants, and our family specialists support our children and families in addressing these needs, which brings me to the challenges that Head Start is facing today.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=555.0)              |
|   566    |   571    | We have experienced a significant staffing crisis at Head Start.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=566.0)              |
|   571    |   577    | We have 13 of our preschool classes that we have not been able to open this school year.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=571.0)              |
|   577    |   579    | Why are these classes closed?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=577.0)              |
|   579    |   584    | Because we do not have enough teachers and teacher assistants to be able to open those classes.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=579.0)              |
|   584    |   590    | There are several issues that contribute to this problem, but one of the issues is teacher compensation.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=584.0)              |
|   590    |   596    | We have lost a number of experienced, highly qualified teachers to the school system due to pay.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=590.0)              |

|   598    |   605    | Just for comparison, let's look at a teacher with a bachelor's degree in early childhood education with pre-K certification.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=598.0)              |
|   605    |   613    | In actual dollars, that teacher working in the Head Start program would make $33,400 in a year.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=605.0)              |
|   613    |   621    | That same teacher working in the Knox County school system would make $43,077.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=613.0)              |
|   621    |   626    | This is a disparity that we are trying to address, and this is important.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=621.0)              |
|   626    |   630    | If we don't fix this staffing issue, we stand to lose a lot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=626.0)              |

|   753    |   757    | and the Head Start program is just one of them that is so important.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=753.0)              |

|   857    |   863    | We can't open classes and serve these families, and it's because of staffing,                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=857.0)              |
|   863    |   871    | and it's because of the shortfall, and so this commission will learn fairly quickly                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=863.0)              |

|  4893.48 |  4898.48 | is? I think it's, as I say, for checks and balances on decisions that have been made,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=4893.4800000000005) |
|  4898.48 |  4903.48 | that they were made in the right way and in the right order. Perfect.

|  4903.48 |  4909.48 | that it is for the officers, it is not for the sheriff? Yes. Not about the sheriff?

|  4916.48 |  4922.48 | now supposed to be, quote, an apolitical committee.

|  4927.48 |  4933.48 | commissioner, I think, probably can agree to that.

|  5694.48 |  5699.48 | Two questions I'd like to ask you is why you want to be on the merit board again                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5694.4800000000005) |
|  5699.48 |  5702.48 | and what is the most important thing you think about the merit board?                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5699.4800000000005) |
|  5702.48 |  5707.48 | The most important thing the merit board does is there for the officers to have an appeal,                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5702.4800000000005) |
|  5707.48 |  5712.48 | to have someone listen to them that's independently, that's set up by this body to be able to be a go-between                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5707.4800000000005) |

|  5715.48 |  5719.48 | And then the reason why I want to be there is what I've been trying to explain.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5715.4800000000005) |

|  5721.48 |  5724.48 | I have the background to implement it and be fair,                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5721.4800000000005) |
|  5724.48 |  5729.48 | and I think I bring to that table something that they can, even as being a pastor,                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5724.4800000000005) |
|  5729.48 |  5733.48 | that the officers can trust that I'll make a decision on the facts                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=5729.4800000000005) |

|  6112.48 |  6117.48 | On grievance hearings, and you being an attorney, I would think that you probably understand this                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6112.4800000000005) |

|  6128.48 |  6136.48 | And as far as working with the executive director to be able to use her,                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6128.4800000000005) |

|  6144.48 |  6153.48 | But it is important to also be respectful of that office, I feel like.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6144.4800000000005) |
|  6153.48 |  6159.48 | And I think that's important, and I need to say that to the other ones that I did not do.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6153.4800000000005) |
|  6159.48 |  6161.48 | It just came to me, and I didn't have that in my notes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6159.4800000000005) |

|  6163.48 |  6170.48 | But the grievance hearings are really important for our officers if they feel like they've been wronged.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6163.4800000000005) |
|  6170.48 |  6177.48 | And just like I say, there's been some issues that we haven't been able to,                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6170.4800000000005) |
|  6177.48 |  6181.48 | I don't know if they're being handled the way that they need to be,                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6177.4800000000005) |

|  6183.48 |  6187.48 | But for somebody coming on to it, I want them to be very aware                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6183.4800000000005) |
|  6187.48 |  6192.48 | and be very strong in being able to stand on your own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6187.4800000000005) |

|  6537.48 |  6540.48 | I have a couple of questions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6537.4800000000005) |
|  6540.48 |  6544.48 | I guess really they need to be addressed to the commissioners.                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6540.4800000000005) |
|  6544.48 |  6551.48 | This first one probably more to Commissioner Oster since she has been on the Merit Board.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6544.4800000000005) |
|  6551.48 |  6560.48 | Is it the role, Commissioner, of a Merit Board member to investigate?                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6551.4800000000005) |
|  6560.48 |  6566.48 | The information will be given from the officer or his or her attorney,                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6560.4800000000005) |
|  6566.48 |  6570.48 | and then the sheriff will also give their information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6566.4800000000005) |
|  6571.48 |  6575.48 | But there is a limited scope of what the council can be investigating.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6571.4800000000005) |
|  6575.48 |  6576.48 | All right.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6575.4800000000005) |
|  6576.48 |  6581.48 | Because I did hear a couple of applicants say, yeah, you know, I can keep an open mind,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6576.4800000000005) |
|  6581.48 |  6583.48 | but I would have to investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6581.4800000000005) |
|  6583.48 |  6585.48 | So that kind of got my attention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6583.4800000000005) |
|  6585.48 |  6588.48 | And maybe they were saying that they kind of wanted to hear both sides of it,                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6585.4800000000005) |
|  6588.48 |  6590.48 | which I am fine with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6588.4800000000005) |
|  6590.48 |  6596.48 | I just don't want to hear that they have made up a decision                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6590.4800000000005) |

|  6602.48 |  6608.48 | But it's not their role to personally go out and be asking questions and investigate.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6602.4800000000005) |

|  6616.48 |  6625.48 | one of our applicants was honest enough to put down that he's vice president of a local Republican club.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6616.4800000000005) |

|  6635.48 |  6644.48 | and it's a good thing to be able to put down that you step up and, you know, you help clubs out.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=6635.4800000000005) |

|  7722.76 |  7734.76 | on, in the end, what is the amount going to be per, and I know when I asked per home that                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7722.76)            |
|  7735.52 |  7739.52 | it depends on square footage and all of that, but just a rough estimate.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7735.52)            |

|  7752.52 |  7758.52 | Yes, we, in preparation of the budget this year, we were looking at that, and we feel                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7752.52)            |
|  7758.52 |  7763.52 | like that at this point in time we do need a fee increase just to kind of have our department                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7758.52)            |

|  7777.28 |  7785.28 | there are 100 to $500,000 homes, probably what's mostly built in a lot of our community.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7777.280000000001)  |
|  7785.28 |  7791.28 | I did the analysis on that, assuming the home was 2,000 square feet, which is fairly common.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7785.280000000001)  |
|  7792.04 |  7799.04 | The $15 that we proposed this fiscal year would correlate to a $90 permit fee increase                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7792.04)            |
|  7799.04 |  7806.04 | for that permit, whereas, you know, next year, assuming the ICC rate stayed about the same,                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7799.04)            |
|  7806.04 |  7808.04 | it would be another $15.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7806.04)            |
|  7808.04 |  7814.04 | So, at the end of the day, if things were to stay somewhat the same, we'd be looking                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7808.04)            |

|  7822.8  |  7827.8  | So, to your point, we want to be conscious of home affordability, but yet cover our costs                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7822.8)             |

|  7832.8  |  7839.8  | What was alarming was the $15 per square foot I was looking at, and I multiplied that out,                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7832.8)             |
|  7839.8  |  7841.8  | and I thought, that's thousands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7839.8)             |
|  7842.56 |  7845.56 | So, that's just an arbitrary...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7842.56)            |
|  7845.56 |  7851.56 | That's how we value the home, and then that valuation gets plugged into a chart, and then                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7845.56)            |
|  7851.56 |  7854.56 | that chart defines the permit value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7851.56)            |

|  7888.32 |  7892.32 | what we would consider to be the critical path process, which one is inspection, and                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7888.320000000001)  |
|  7893.08 |  7897.08 | the other is probably zoning review, because obviously, if we're charging more, we want                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7893.080000000001)  |
|  7897.08 |  7900.08 | to provide even a better service than what we currently do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7897.080000000001)  |
|  7900.08 |  7904.08 | So, there will be some additional staff hired as part of this fee increase.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7900.080000000001)  |
|  7904.08 |  7910.08 | It's my understanding that the building community, no kickback from them, they actually would                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7904.080000000001)  |
|  7910.08 |  7914.08 | like to see more inspectors, because as soon as they get their inspection, they can go                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7910.080000000001)  |
|  7914.08 |  7916.08 | into the next step.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7914.080000000001)  |
|  7916.08 |  7918.08 | So, hopefully, this will work out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7916.080000000001)  |
|  7918.84 |  7925.84 | I'm for it, and hopefully we can get some funds coming in to hire those personnel.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7918.84)            |

|  7933.84 |  7941.84 | Mr. Snowden, I had some concerns just due to our housing shortage and the cost of housing                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7933.84)            |
|  7942.6  |  7948.6  | going up, that these costs are going to be passed on as well to buyers.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7942.6)             |
|  7948.6  |  7954.6  | So, it's my understanding you said $90, but then you said less than $200.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7948.6)             |

|  7971.36 |  7979.36 | So, we are going up $15 per the square foot evaluation proposed July 1 of 2023, and then                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7971.360000000001)  |

|  7989.36 |  7995.36 | So, it would be a $90 increase this fiscal year proposed, and then another $90 approximately                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=7989.360000000001)  |

|  8018.12 |  8030.12 | It starts out at, there's a flat fee if your house was, the fee is $490 for the first $100                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8018.120000000001)  |

|  8391    |  8398    | Mr. Caldwell, when I read the resolution, I was a little bit concerned because of the                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8391.0)             |

|  8415.76 |  8422.76 | My initial concern was of who was running the department in 2008 at the trustee's office.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8415.76)            |
|  8422.76 |  8431.76 | And so that's why I was concerned that was this a loan to CAC and was there a repayment                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8422.76)            |
|  8431.76 |  8435.76 | schedule at that time?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8431.76)            |
|  8435.76 |  8438.76 | So at that time there was not a repayment schedule.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8435.76)            |
|  8439.52 |  8441.52 | It was a loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8439.52)            |
|  8441.52 |  8445.52 | We refer to it as an advance just from an accounting standpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8441.52)            |
|  8445.52 |  8451.52 | And the amount was 2.5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8445.52)            |
|  8451.52 |  8458.52 | And ultimately they have some cash flow issues or had at that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8451.52)            |
|  8458.52 |  8461.52 | And so we were trying to help them from that standpoint.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8458.52)            |
|  8461.52 |  8464.52 | So we did an advance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8461.52)            |
|  8465.28 |  8472.28 | And then ultimately a little after that, there was some damage to the Mobile Mills kitchen.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8465.28)            |
|  8472.28 |  8474.28 | We gave them a loan for that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8472.28)            |
|  8474.28 |  8476.28 | And they repaid that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8474.28)            |
|  8476.28 |  8479.28 | And that repayment ended this year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8476.28)            |
|  8479.28 |  8488.28 | And so we come up with a way to move that payment over from since the loan on the Mobile                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8479.28)            |
|  8488.28 |  8494.28 | Mills kitchen is done to just continue that payment but let it go towards the advance.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8488.28)            |
|  8495.04 |  8498.04 | And that advance should be paid off in about 20 years.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8495.04)            |
|  8498.04 |  8499.04 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8498.04)            |
|  8499.04 |  8506.04 | And then I understand that they, CAC made some partial payments on the 2.5 million.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8499.04)            |
|  8506.04 |  8513.04 | Were those credited as towards the loan amount or was some of that towards interest?                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8506.04)            |
|  8513.04 |  8516.04 | It would be towards the loan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8513.04)            |
|  8516.04 |  8520.04 | At the time, and period if I'm wrong, he'll stop me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8516.04)            |

|  8529.8  |  8536.8  | And then because we've had to carry this on our books for so long, for 15 years, was the                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8529.800000000001)  |

|  8543.8  |  8548.8  | And advance is not something that's uncommon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8543.800000000001)  |
|  8549.56 |  8558.56 | But we did get notification I think a couple years ago from the state saying that if payments                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8549.56)            |
|  8558.56 |  8563.56 | are not being made to lower the advance amount, then you need to write that advance off.                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8558.56)            |

|  8605.56 |  8611.56 | We just charged CCAC the same rate that we charged circuit court for their ARPA loan                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8605.56)            |

|  8613.56 |  8619.56 | And I guess when we negotiated this, this was long before the interest rates went up as well.                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8613.56)            |

|  8622.56 |  8624.56 | That's why I was wondering because that was the same rate we charged.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8622.56)            |

|  8811.56 |  8812.56 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8811.56)            |
|  8812.56 |  8825.56 | I had the opportunity on Friday morning to meet with Lieutenant Governor McNally, and I presented our resolution to him, and he was very appreciative of that.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8812.56)            |
|  8825.56 |  8841.56 | In our conversation, he said that he was working with the members of the Senate and with the House to see if the appropriations for all four items could be accomplished in this budget year.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8825.56)            |
|  8841.56 |  8851.56 | And he said, as of Friday, he wasn't sure about that, but if it wasn't accomplished, it would definitely be accomplished next year.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8841.56)            |
|  8852.56 |  8870.56 | He did say that members of the Senate and the House were going to be working, I believe it's this coming Sunday, on some of these budget issues that are behind the budget to make sure that they can move forward with this, because this is very important for our children. | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8852.56)            |
|  8871.56 |  8878.56 | And there's also another kind of a companion bill that's going through that passed the State Senate.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8871.56)            |
|  8878.56 |  8881.56 | It's Senate Bill 274.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8878.56)            |
|  8881.56 |  8904.56 | That's already passed 33 to zip, and it deals with three different amendments that addresses the type of equipment that needs to be installed in our schools and the type of drills that will have to be mandatory that they'll have to take place on a yearly basis.          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8881.56)            |
|  8905.56 |  8910.56 | And the House, I think, is supposed to take up their bill, Companion Bill 322, this week.                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8905.56)            |

|  8920.56 |  8925.56 | I was under the impression that House bill passed on April 6th, but I will look back.                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8920.56)            |

|  8929.56 |  8930.56 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8929.56)            |
|  8930.56 |  8940.56 | Commissioner Schoomaker, since you sit down with Senator McNally, this is talking about securing windows and glass in school buildings.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8930.56)            |
|  8940.56 |  8946.56 | But just like what happened in Covenant, that is a private school.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8940.56)            |
|  8946.56 |  8957.56 | Now, is this going to be considered all private schools and then also where they have, say, Mother's Day outs or preschools that's actually at churches or different buildings as opposed to school buildings?                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8946.56)            |
|  8960.56 |  8968.56 | Well, in the Senate bill, they're addressing both public schools and public charter schools.                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8960.56)            |
|  8969.56 |  8984.56 | I think there's actually going to be, I'm trying to find it here, on another, also they are referencing a church-related school and a private school in the definitions.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8969.56)            |
|  8984.56 |  8985.56 | Okay, okay.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8984.56)            |
|  8985.56 |  8995.56 | They have, apparently, there is some kind of film that can go on glass that makes it so you can't do what happened in that church.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8985.56)            |
|  8995.56 |  8996.56 | Okay, good.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8995.56)            |
|  8996.56 |  9004.56 | Because I know that there's a lot of the Mother's Day out and preschool programs that's recognized by the state, so I wasn't sure how they were going to fall underneath there.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=8996.56)            |
|  9004.56 |  9019.56 | Also, on the last, when it says armed guards, and that to me sounds like it's military, is it actually going to be SRO officers or SSO officers and they just put armed guards?                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9004.56)            |
|  9019.56 |  9027.56 | Well, that was actually the caption, the way the letter was written to the governor.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9019.56)            |
|  9027.56 |  9031.56 | So, what it actually means is school resource officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9027.56)            |
|  9031.56 |  9032.56 | Okay, so an SRO.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9031.56)            |

|  9033.56 |  9045.56 | In other words, when Randy McNally sent his letter to the governor, Bill Lee, that's how he just put it in four captions and then each caption had a breakdown.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9033.56)            |

|  9065.56 |  9068.56 | That was my question as well, the language of armed guards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9065.56)            |
|  9068.56 |  9076.56 | I was just wondering if we could be more consistent with language used in most of the school legislation, which is security resource officer.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9068.56)            |
|  9076.56 |  9081.56 | I don't know if you would be agreeable to a friendly amendment there.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9076.56)            |

|  9086.56 |  9088.56 | This is Randy McNally's words.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9086.56)            |
|  9088.56 |  9098.56 | While we've made great progress in making sure our public schools have access to school resource officers, I believe we can do more.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9088.56)            |
|  9098.56 |  9105.56 | Reports indicate that the shooter at Covenant chose the school because of its minimal security.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9098.56)            |
|  9105.56 |  9112.56 | If we can ensure that all schools, public and private, have armed guards, we will be able to cut down on these events significantly.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9105.56)            |
|  9112.56 |  9118.56 | So we have armed guards in our schools right now, in our Knox County schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9112.56)            |
|  9118.56 |  9120.56 | Correct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9118.56)            |
|  9120.56 |  9124.56 | Yes, but they're security resource officers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9120.56)            |
|  9124.56 |  9129.56 | I'm just a stickler about wording and legislation kind of just aligning.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9124.56)            |
|  9130.56 |  9142.56 | I think what they're trying to say is it's somebody who's trained how to use a firearm as opposed to just somebody who doesn't have anything.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9130.56)            |
|  9148.56 |  9151.56 | Anybody else have any discussion?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9148.56)            |
|  9151.56 |  9154.56 | I had a question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9151.56)            |
|  9154.56 |  9160.56 | I know it is important for all these security measures to be enforced in all school buildings.                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9154.56)            |
|  9160.56 |  9166.56 | Is there a security audit that would take place?                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9160.56)            |
|  9166.56 |  9173.56 | Of course, this would definitely go forward with new construction of school buildings, but how do we know?                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9166.56)            |
|  9173.56 |  9177.56 | Some schools may already have magnetic locks on doors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9173.56)            |
|  9177.56 |  9180.56 | Is there anything like that that you know of that's in the works?                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9177.56)            |
|  9180.56 |  9191.56 | Just a security audit or at least the money for that to go to each LEA to perform the school security audit on every school in the system?                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9180.56)            |
|  9192.56 |  9210.56 | In the Senate bill, they talk about security systems, visual recording systems, cameras, communication systems, and how to interact with the 911 people.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9192.56)            |
|  9211.56 |  9225.56 | They will also, each school, safety team, private school, and church-related school shall conduct at least one armed intruder drill, incident command drill, and emergency safety bus drill.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9211.56)            |
|  9225.56 |  9233.56 | And then it spells out what each of those three items, what you have to do.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9225.56)            |
|  9234.56 |  9248.56 | Okay, so there's not specifically something that says put forth money to each individual LEA to have a security audit done on all schools?                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9234.56)            |
|  9248.56 |  9259.56 | Yeah, I believe they'll handle that when the Senate and House members are going to be able to get together and discuss the final budget.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9248.56)            |

|  9271.56 |  9280.56 | This is a great discussion, but as the security personnel would like to say, loose lips sink ships.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9271.56)            |
|  9280.56 |  9290.56 | So we really don't need to know which school is what, and you don't let the bad guys know what's going on.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9280.56)            |

|  9303.56 |  9308.56 | I don't think we need to request what school is getting what or anything like that.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9303.56)            |
|  9308.56 |  9314.56 | We just need to be observant, can't even say the word, ourselves.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9308.56)            |

|  9316.56 |  9326.56 | It's more to eliminate any kind of deficit in security that one school building may have where the one down the street may not.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9316.56)            |

|  9331.56 |  9344.56 | Yeah, I think if we're going to be a commission that's going to send this to the state, I think each commissioner needs to know how this is, how it's going to play out.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9331.56)            |
|  9344.56 |  9348.56 | I don't need to know their security plan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9344.56)            |
|  9348.56 |  9351.56 | That's the school and the school system's responsibility.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9348.56)            |
|  9351.56 |  9361.56 | But I do need to know, like I say, are we going to have military people that are going to be there or SRO officers?                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9351.56)            |
|  9361.56 |  9366.56 | I mean, you have to, we have to have some specifics when we sign on to things.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9361.56)            |
|  9366.56 |  9372.56 | So that's my, Madam Chair's having a little problem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9366.56)            |

|  9421.56 |  9423.56 | So I agree with you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9421.56)            |
|  9423.56 |  9425.56 | Yeah, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9423.56)            |
|  9425.56 |  9427.56 | Madam Chair, may I speak?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9425.56)            |
|  9427.56 |  9429.56 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9427.56)            |
|  9429.56 |  9433.56 | I appreciate you bringing that up, Commissioner Daley, because I wasn't going to say this.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9429.56)            |
|  9433.56 |  9437.56 | I really was kind of teetering on whether I was going to say this or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9433.56)            |
|  9437.56 |  9439.56 | But I think I'm going to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9437.56)            |
|  9439.56 |  9442.56 | I don't have a problem with the resolution.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9439.56)            |
|  9442.56 |  9446.56 | And let me say how impressed I was with our students coming down and speaking                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9442.56)            |
|  9446.56 |  9452.56 | and other people that are speaking about gun safety and our kids' safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9446.56)            |
|  9452.56 |  9458.56 | I think I would rather have seen a resolution like this maybe come in May or June.                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9452.56)            |
|  9458.56 |  9468.56 | I kind of feel like that these resolutions and the law should have been done years ago.                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9458.56)            |
|  9468.56 |  9473.56 | And I don't want to jump into a political battle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9468.56)            |
|  9473.56 |  9476.56 | And I almost kind of feel like that's where we're at right now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9473.56)            |
|  9476.56 |  9483.56 | And we really haven't even taken a breath to really respect the families that have just buried their loved ones.                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9476.56)            |
|  9483.56 |  9487.56 | And so for me it's not a political thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9483.56)            |
|  9487.56 |  9490.56 | It is definitely a safety thing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9487.56)            |
|  9490.56 |  9496.56 | But that's where I'm having a little heartburn about it even being on the agenda right now.                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9490.56)            |
|  9496.56 |  9500.56 | I'm not saying that I don't agree with it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9496.56)            |
|  9500.56 |  9506.56 | I just don't want this to be a political fight.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9500.56)            |
|  9506.56 |  9508.56 | And I feel like it's going to be.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9506.56)            |

|  9540.56 |  9546.56 | I'm a little confused about the conversation about timing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9540.56)            |

|  9564.56 |  9568.56 | And, you know, all of our public schools are state schools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9564.56)            |
|  9568.56 |  9571.56 | We just operate and administer them on a local level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9568.56)            |
|  9571.56 |  9583.56 | So these two resolutions are just statements saying if on 46, if you think Governor McNally is on the right track                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9571.56)            |
|  9583.56 |  9589.56 | and this commission wants to make a statement, a political, this is a political statement.                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9583.56)            |
|  9589.56 |  9592.56 | This is an opinion of this body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9589.56)            |
|  9592.56 |  9597.56 | And number 48, if you feel like Governor Bill Lee is on the right track, these are just two resolutions.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9592.56)            |
|  9597.56 |  9603.56 | Now, they are likely going to finish their session by next Friday or Saturday.                                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9597.56)            |
|  9603.56 |  9615.56 | So if these get approved tonight as approvals, then, well, no, they can't be approved until next Monday anyway.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9603.56)            |
|  9615.56 |  9620.56 | I mean, the session is going to be over by the time anything is actually taken in formal action.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9615.56)            |
|  9620.56 |  9627.56 | And a resolution would be signed by our chair and law department and mayor and sent to Nashville.                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9620.56)            |
|  9627.56 |  9633.56 | So the sessions, anything they're going to do is going to be done well before they even get the statement.                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9627.56)            |
|  9633.56 |  9640.56 | I think this commission body has to just decide, do you want to agree with these two statements?                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9633.56)            |
|  9640.56 |  9645.56 | And as an opinion of this body, do we feel like they're on the right track?                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9640.56)            |
|  9645.56 |  9650.56 | And if so, I wouldn't wait until next week or any month thereafter.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9645.56)            |
|  9651.56 |  9657.56 | Just make your voice heard tonight because it has no bearing on what they're going to do between now and next week.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9651.56)            |
|  9657.56 |  9662.56 | At best case scenario, after their session is done, they're going to get a copy from us a week later.                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9657.56)            |
|  9662.56 |  9664.56 | And whatever they've done is done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9662.56)            |
|  9664.56 |  9671.56 | So I would encourage us to just go ahead and take action on both of these tonight and make your voice heard.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9664.56)            |
|  9671.56 |  9675.56 | If it's a unanimous vote, it gets approved, it stays on consent next week,                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9671.56)            |
|  9675.56 |  9679.56 | and then we'll send a resolution over a week after they're out of session.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9675.56)            |
|  9679.56 |  9686.56 | If it doesn't get unanimously approved at either one of those, then we'll move it forward to next week and do another vote.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9679.56)            |
|  9686.56 |  9694.56 | And to me, that, I think, just pushes the ball down the road and makes it a bigger political issue.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9686.56)            |
|  9694.56 |  9696.56 | I think these are pretty simple resolutions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9694.56)            |
|  9696.56 |  9699.56 | They're pretty simple statements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9696.56)            |
|  9699.56 |  9706.56 | And I would just encourage us to take action tonight on both of them.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9699.56)            |
|  9706.56 |  9709.56 | Commissioner Schoonmaker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9706.56)            |
|  9709.56 |  9713.56 | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9709.56)            |
|  9713.56 |  9725.56 | When I saw what Representative, excuse me, Senator McNally's effort to notify the governor that we needed to take action quickly,                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9713.56)            |
|  9725.56 |  9735.56 | one of my thoughts was because Senator McNally represents citizens in Knox County, a small portion.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9725.56)            |
|  9735.56 |  9743.56 | And I thought, you know, here's somebody who wants to go forward with taking some immediate action                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9735.56)            |
|  9743.56 |  9752.56 | and to get the attention of the governor, and he's doing it for not only the kids in Knox County, but for all 95 counties.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9743.56)            |
|  9752.56 |  9762.56 | And I think that when they try to do a letter to the governor, you try to make it as simple and concise as possible.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9752.56)            |
|  9762.56 |  9769.56 | There was never any legislative intent to have armed military troops in any schools.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9762.56)            |
|  9769.56 |  9777.56 | It's simply saying that they would have school resource officers who are armed.                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9769.56)            |
|  9777.56 |  9788.56 | There's a caption in the Senate bill that actually lines out what the private schools and church-related schools,                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9777.56)            |
|  9788.56 |  9791.56 | what their course of action is.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9788.56)            |
|  9791.56 |  9801.56 | As far as by October 1st, they have to submit to the local law enforcement in their community what their actual action plan is.                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9791.56)            |
|  9801.56 |  9807.56 | And every October 1st from that point forward, they have to submit that plan                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9801.56)            |
|  9807.56 |  9819.56 | so law enforcement knows exactly what's going on with that appropriate church-related school or private school.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9807.56)            |
|  9819.56 |  9826.56 | I think it's pretty detailed on what kind of drills they want to have, but we need to do something.                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9819.56)            |
|  9826.56 |  9834.56 | And I just thought this was a great way to support our state senator and our lieutenant governor at the same time                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9826.56)            |
|  9834.56 |  9847.56 | and do something that is a positive effort, hopefully to save the lives of some of our children.                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9834.56)            |

|  9851.56 |  9858.56 | Thank you. I just want to say I know it may be a little uncomfortable because of party lines or whatever, people's beliefs,                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9851.56)            |
|  9858.56 |  9863.56 | but I think with both resolutions, I think we're just saying let's do something.                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9858.56)            |
|  9864.56 |  9867.56 | We know that it's up to the state to make that decision.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9864.56)            |
|  9867.56 |  9873.56 | I mean, I will support this resolution that's before us now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9867.56)            |
|  9873.56 |  9879.56 | I might not agree with everything, but I think we have to just stand in what we believe in and support the children,                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9873.56)            |
|  9879.56 |  9882.56 | and hopefully the state can work it out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9879.56)            |

|  9962.56 |  9968.56 | Do you want to let us know why this was what you wanted to bring before us?                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9962.56)            |
|  9968.56 |  9974.56 | Yeah, and codes are still here back there somewhere.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9968.56)            |
|  9974.56 |  9983.56 | This is a, you've got a picture here of a hot tub that's been sitting in a subdivision for five years,                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9974.56)            |
|  9983.56 |  9991.56 | and we have asked, codes has gone and asked them to move it to the side or back of the house,                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9983.56)            |
|  9991.56 |  9998.56 | and this is the first thing that the neighbors, and you driving by, that's the first thing you see is this hot tub.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9991.56)            |
|  9998.56 | 10006.6  | Well, in our codes, we have no definition of a swimming pool hot tub,                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=9998.56)            |
| 10006.6  | 10011.6  | how it's to be operated, and maybe where it's supposed to be set or put.                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10006.56)           |
| 10011.6  | 10017.6  | So what we're asking, after meeting with Mr. Snowden and codes and the law director,                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10011.56)           |
| 10017.6  | 10021.6  | we're asking planning to go and look at it with a definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10017.56)           |
| 10021.6  | 10026.6  | If you would read the caption there, Mr. Moyers, law director Moyers,                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10021.56)           |
| 10026.6  | 10034.6  | has come up with what a definition of a swimming pool, 24 inches of water, you need to read it.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10026.56)           |
| 10034.6  | 10038.6  | So what this will do, it will send it to planning.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10034.56)           |
| 10038.6  | 10040.6  | Planning will review it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10038.56)           |
| 10040.6  | 10043.6  | They'll make a suggestion whether to do it or not to do it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10040.56)           |
| 10043.6  | 10048.6  | Then it comes back to us for our vote, our opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10043.56)           |
| 10048.6  | 10053.6  | Mr. Snowden, am I correct?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10048.56)           |
| 10053.6  | 10054.6  | That is correct, sir.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10053.56)           |
| 10054.6  | 10061.6  | Right now, the way the ordinance is worded, a swimming pool or hot tub is kind of categorized the same thing.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10054.56)           |
| 10061.6  | 10069.6  | It has to have 24 inches of water in it, and with this structure being tarped over, it's essentially construction material.                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10061.56)           |
| 10069.6  | 10075.6  | So it's a little bit of a gray area, and your proposal would clarify that.                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10069.56)           |
| 10075.6  | 10081.6  | And hopefully the proposal will come back to where it has to be operable.                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10075.56)           |
| 10081.6  | 10086.6  | And I don't know if we can keep somebody from having a hot tub in the front yard,                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10081.56)           |
| 10086.6  | 10090.6  | but at least we know that it's going to be operable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10086.56)           |

| 10091.6  | 10094.6  | Mr. Law director, is that correct to your knowledge?                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10091.56)           |
| 10094.6  | 10095.6  | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10094.56)           |
| 10095.6  | 10102.6  | The current definition of a swimming pool is any structure designed for swimming or bathing that has at least 24 inches of water in it.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10095.56)           |
| 10102.6  | 10108.6  | So what we're asking the planning commission to do is to say that it's any structure designed for swimming or bathing                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10102.56)           |
| 10108.6  | 10112.6  | that has the capacity to have at least two feet of water in it,                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10108.56)           |
| 10112.6  | 10115.6  | irregardless of whether it actually has the water in it or not.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10112.56)           |
| 10115.6  | 10120.6  | So under the new definition, this hot tub would qualify as a swimming pool,                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10115.56)           |
| 10120.6  | 10131.6  | and under our regs it would have to be in the side yard or the rear yard of the home, like any other swimming pool.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10120.56)           |

| 10135.6  | 10146.6  | And just to lighten the mood a little bit, can anyone tell me what recreational bathing consists of?                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10135.56)           |

| 10426.6  | 10429.6  | and then it goes into the procedure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10426.56)           |
| 10429.6  | 10432.6  | And so that's the executive order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10429.56)           |
| 10432.6  | 10440.6  | And also, the stronger order of protection law came out of his press conference that he gave                                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10432.56)           |
| 10440.6  | 10447.6  | when he first read this executive order, and it's more of to ensure that those,                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10440.56)           |
| 10447.6  | 10454.6  | and it goes back to that mental health, temporarily don't have access to any weapons                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10447.56)           |
| 10454.6  | 10460.6  | that could, if they are in a state where they could harm themselves or other people.                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10454.56)           |
| 10460.6  | 10470.6  | So this resolution has, looks like it has two things, the instant check system and order protection.                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10460.56)           |
| 10470.6  | 10475.6  | It does not, is it covering those two things, which I see this resolution doing,                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10470.56)           |
| 10475.6  | 10478.6  | which that's the case I have no problem with.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10475.56)           |
| 10478.6  | 10489.6  | But is it covering the whole governor's executive order, which is the red flag laws?                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10478.56)           |
| 10489.6  | 10492.6  | No, his executive order does not have anything about red flag laws.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10489.56)           |
| 10492.6  | 10499.6  | He urged recommendation, he recommended things to the state legislature to look into,                                                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10492.56)           |

| 10501.6  | 10508.6  | But the executive order itself does not mention those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10501.56)           |
| 10508.6  | 10515.6  | Mr. Law Director, orders of protection, I guess you've done them in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10508.56)           |

| 10521.6  | 10527.6  | we walked into a room of order of protection, and it was file cabinets,                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10521.56)           |
| 10527.6  | 10530.6  | just file cabinet after file cabinet after file cabinet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10527.56)           |
| 10530.6  | 10535.6  | So will you walk us through what an order of protection is and what it really does?                                                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10530.56)           |
| 10535.6  | 10547.6  | Well, an order of protection is, an officer cannot generally arrest a person for a misdemeanor                                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10535.56)           |
| 10547.6  | 10549.6  | unless the officer witnesses it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10547.56)           |
| 10549.6  | 10554.6  | So if somebody is stalking somebody or harassing somebody,                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10549.56)           |
| 10554.6  | 10558.6  | unless the officer witnesses it, if it's a misdemeanor, the officer can't do anything about it.                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10554.56)           |
| 10558.6  | 10566.6  | The order of protection allows the officer to arrest a person who is in violation of the order on the spot.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=10558.56)           |

| 11605.6  | 11617.6  | Jim, did we accept in 2019 the 2018 International Building Codes by resolution?                                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11605.56)           |
| 11617.6  | 11618.6  | We did.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11617.56)           |
| 11618.6  | 11628.6  | We adopted, I think it was November of 2018, or maybe December, November, December, the 2018 ICC codes.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11618.56)           |
| 11628.6  | 11634.6  | And since at that time the state had not adopted the 2018, they have since adopted it,                                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11628.56)           |
| 11634.6  | 11639.6  | and there are some things that they have in there that we are less stringent than,                                                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11634.56)           |
| 11639.6  | 11642.6  | and by rule we cannot be less stringent than the state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11639.56)           |
| 11642.6  | 11647.6  | So that's one of the reasons why we're back here with this adoption is to correct those issues,                                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11642.56)           |
| 11647.6  | 11654.6  | as well as just over the last couple of years we've identified some things that we want to improve in our interpretation,                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11647.56)           |
| 11654.6  | 11659.6  | and so we've addressed those as well to just make it a little better process.                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11654.56)           |

| 11665.6  | 11671.6  | And the way our code stands today, we do have a couple of things that we're less stringent than,                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11665.56)           |
| 11671.6  | 11679.6  | so we obviously have to bring that standard up to comply with state requirements.                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=11671.56)           |

| 12386.6  | 12387.6  | Thank you, Madam Chair.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12386.56)           |
| 12387.6  | 12392.6  | I just wanted to point it out that there are several zoning items that have conditions,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12387.56)           |
| 12392.6  | 12396.6  | and it is very important that if you make a motion that you include those conditions                                                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12392.56)           |
| 12396.6  | 12398.6  | so that they can be enforceable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12396.56)           |
| 12398.6  | 12400.6  | I just wanted to remind the body of that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12398.56)           |
| 12400.6  | 12407.6  | And then also Commissioner Beeler asked me to just briefly make a comment on number 60,                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12400.56)           |
| 12407.6  | 12415.6  | which is a really great request going from rural.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12407.56)           |
| 12415.6  | 12419.6  | Well, it's actually asking for a rural preservation zone,                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12415.56)           |
| 12419.6  | 12421.6  | and that's something we don't see very often,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12419.56)           |
| 12421.6  | 12424.6  | but this is a horse farm who wants to protect the rural settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12421.56)           |
| 12425.6  | 12429.6  | And so I just wanted to say thank you to that applicant                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-230417?start=12425.56)           |
