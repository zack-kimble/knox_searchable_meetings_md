| 0:11:39| Sorry to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| I just wanted to make sure we pulled from consent 9022DP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| It shows as agenda item number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Item 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=706)|
| 0:11:55| I think I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=718)|
| 0:12:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Chairman, you ready for a motion, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Bear with me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I'm working off about three sheets of paper now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| So how do we handle the one we're pulling off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| I'll just add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=737)|
| 0:12:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=740)|
| 0:12:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| So, Chairman, I'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| We approve from consent items read with the exception of item 22 and 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=744)|

| 0:12:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=761)|
| 0:12:57| First item on the agenda is item 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| Item 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=795)|
| 0:13:31| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Bear with me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| I think we just heard that the Queen died, so I just want to share that message.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| Queen Elizabeth has just passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Ninety-six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| Ninety-six years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| God rest her soul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| We're down to item 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=837)|
| 0:13:58| The applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Tyler Williamson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Address is 5504 Dogwood Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| Could you speak into the mic, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| I just want to say a few words, I guess, because there were some public comments on the file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| just in case any commissioners have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=863)|
| 0:14:28| Staff recommendation was to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| I want to thank the commenter who opposed the rezoning for her concern over the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=873)|
| 0:14:41| We appreciate the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| We live in the neighborhood as well, have for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=882)|
| 0:14:46| Grew up in Found City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=886)|
| 0:14:47| My dad was the chair of Found City Town Hall some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| My wife and I run a general contracting business, and part of our work has been restoring the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=891)|
| 0:14:57| We've restored five houses in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| We want to improve the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| Special interest in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| We own the house next door to it and are in the process of restoring it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| Don't feel the need to get into the sector plan because the staff already has said that it's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| The fact of the matter is that Knoxville needs more affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| and it fits the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| On the less than a mile drive from the duck pond to the house, there's nine apartment complexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| six of which have more than 12 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| So we feel like it definitely fits the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| We love Found City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| It's our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Every project we take on is to improve the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| Our plan is to keep the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| We want to build something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| Originally when we bought the property, it was really because we didn't want a builder coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| throwing up something cheap and fast, which is what's happened throughout the neighborhood, clearly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| if you drive through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| So we're just wanting to put in a nice building, a nice property, to tie into the property that we own next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=969)|
| 0:16:17| Thank you very much for your time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Again, I ask the Planning Commission to follow staff recommendation and approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| So the staff recommendation is to approve RN2 and hillside protection because it is consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=986)|
| 0:16:35| I'll open it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| Thank you, Director Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| So I guess in reading the comments that were posted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| and I do really appreciate you moving into the neighborhood and wanting to make a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| wanting to improve both your property and the property adjacent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| My biggest concern is the fact that that street is all RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| And when the zoning ordinance was just adopted less than three years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1026)|
| 0:17:12| the only difference between RN1 and RN2 are the property size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| And the property that you're asking to be rezoned is consistent with the other houses that are on your street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| including your house, and being that it's over 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| The minimum lot size for RN1 is 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| You're a little over 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Yeah, 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| The minimum lot size for RN2 is 5,000, so that's less than half of what you have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| So I'm going to vote to deny your request because I feel like given your property size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1063)|
| 0:17:54| that RN1 is the right designation that's needed for that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| It's consistent with the rest of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| If you were to look, and I know that you do have RN2 in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| but I think that just because you have RN2 in the neighborhood, it's not adjacent to your street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| and it doesn't keep the character of your street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1093)|
| 0:18:16| If you were to get that RN2 status, you could subdivide it and create two smaller houses on that lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| which wouldn't be consistent with the rest of the houses on that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| So, therefore, I'm going to vote to deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| and I don't know if I should go ahead and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| We've got a couple more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| I mean, I'll accept a motion, but we've got some more folks, or we can come back to you for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1116)|
| 0:18:41| Okay, that would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1121)|
| 0:18:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| Seeing that it's consistent with the sector plan, no objection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| I'd like to make a motion to approve the RN2 single-family residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| HP Hillside Protection First Dash recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| and we still have a couple of lights here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| Commissioner Midas, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1157)|

| 0:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1163)|
| 0:19:34| Next on the agenda is item number 10, the applicant, R.D. Buffett, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| location north side of McIntyre Road, south of Buffett Mill Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| approximate size of tract is 70.37 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| The zoning is RN2 with hillside protection overlay, existing land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| and proposed use is removal of the previously approved planned district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| designation under the former RP1 planned residential zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| I am, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Councilor Mullins, would you prefer to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| I'll defer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1218)|
| 0:20:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| The opposition like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| My name is Damon Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| I live at 5020 Starbuck Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| I'm adjacent to the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| I have some questions about the property use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| especially with it being kind of a hilly terrain on the property adjacent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| A lot of smaller houses get put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| I had questions on whether it would be low-income housing, apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| or condos, and if they're condos, if it's going to be two-story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| because I'm worried about water drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| I'm also worried about traffic flow in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1261)|
| 0:21:06| There's a lot of one-lane roads in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| So I just have some questions that haven't been answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| and I reached out by e-mail, and they didn't have a proposed plan as of yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| So I'll go ahead and reserve the rest of my time until the other person has a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1285)|
| 0:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Thank you, Mr. Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| I reached out to me by e-mail, and we don't have a concept plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| We don't know exactly what type of development we're going to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| At this stage, it's just an application to remove the existing plan development overlay from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| so they can be developed consistent with the underlying RN2 zoning designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| This property is all property in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| It was rezoned as part of the recode, Knoxville, in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| From this planned residential's RP1 to the current RN2 zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| which I think was thoughtfully applied to this property and consistent with the properties in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1327)|
| 0:22:14| As you go west to east, you'll see you have the RN1 zoning, and as you get closer to 640,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1334)|
| 0:22:21| you start to see some RN2, some RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| And as you cross 640, there's some RN4 as it gets closer to the Middletown Pike area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1344)|
| 0:22:31| and that development in that part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| So RN2 is still single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| The sector plan is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| And whatever goes on there will have to be consistent with the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1362)|
| 0:22:48| I understand that there's been an interpretation that perhaps even this overlay doesn't need to be removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1368)|
| 0:22:55| to develop it consistently with the RN2 zoning and that interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| During the process of these overlays being in place and having to remove some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| I've heard different interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| So the safest thing is go ahead and remove the overlay so there's no question about it moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| that we can develop it consistently with the zoning that was applied in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1393)|
| 0:23:20| The 2006 development plan that was on there was about six units an acre, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1400)|
| 0:23:25| is what was approved in the RP zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| That has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| You know, whatever we do in the future, if we subdivide it for more than six lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| and I'm pretty sure property this size will be subdivided at more than six lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| there will have to be a concept plan, a subdivision plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| that comes back through this body for review and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| And at that time, that's when we will have engineering performed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| We will have a concept plan that will address access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| It will address stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| It will address the landscaping buffering that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| And I think that's the time many of your questions will be answered, Mr. Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| But at this time, we just don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| We're not approving any specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| We're just clearing up a remnant zoning overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| that makes it clear we can develop it consistent with the current RN2 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1451)|
| 0:24:17| And when the city put the new zoning ordinance in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| they really made sure they updated their dimensional design elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| They made sure that they dealt, you know, more, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| robustly with landscaping screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| The stormwater ordinances in the city have certainly improved since 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| when the development plan was approved in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| So, you know, again, all we're doing is trying to move forward consistent with the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1477)|
| 0:24:42| And once we know what we can do, we'll come forward with a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| and a subdivision concept plan for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And we'll be glad Mr. Reed has my e-mail when that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| He'll get notice of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| We'll be glad to talk to him and the other neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1494)|
| 0:24:56| I have spoken a little bit with Mr. Collins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| with the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association, about this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| just telling him this is what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| I know this property has a lot of interest as to what's going to happen on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| We understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| My client understood that when they purchased the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| So we'll be glad to work with the neighborhood moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| But at this point, we're just asking that you approve this removal of the overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| The staff recommendation is – I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| Oh, additional comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1528)|

| 0:26:19| if I could suggest a privacy fence or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| because we lived there for over 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| and we got used to just having peace and privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| I'm spoiled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| I'm sorry I'm not good at public speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| You're doing fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| And there's a lot of wildlife there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| I got deer coming through the yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| I got fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| I got wild turkeys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| So it's been really nice there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1609)|
| 0:26:52| And I just would like for it to remain a nice area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| I don't care for a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| I just want something nice to go, you know, over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| And the fact that the tag was way over on my side of the land, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| And I do have survey papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| I think if you've got a deed and a survey, you'll be in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| That's all I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1639)|
| 0:27:20| Thank you for your comments, Ms. Reed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| The staff recommendation is to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| to remove the previously approved planned district designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| from the subject property subject to three conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| Now I'll open it up to our commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| and let's go with Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| This property is probably one of the biggest undeveloped properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| within the city limits of Knoxville north of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| And I think it has a lot of potential to really fill in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| and I would encourage the applicant to come forward with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| that connects to the publicly available roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| and not just, you know, silo itself off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| like some of the little subdivisions around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| because you could connect to McIntyre, Monta Vista, and Buffett Mill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| and really fill that neighborhood in in a nice way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| that fits that massive piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1701)|
| 0:28:24| And so I'm going to make a motion to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| to remove the previously approved planned district C designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| subject to the three conditions per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| We have a motion from Commissioner Schelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| and a second from Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1723)|
| 0:28:46| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1732)|
| 0:29:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Next is item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| The first and second is Ben Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| Location, eastern terminus of Palestine Lane, south of I-4075.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| Tract information, 41.08 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1756)|
| 0:29:22| Present plan is general commercial, hillside protection, planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| Proposed plan is low-density residential, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| planned residential, existing land use, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Proposed five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| The first motion, staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| is to deny the proposed sector plan amendment to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| and hillside protection because it does not meet the location criteria for LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| and is incompatible with adjacent land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| The second motion would be to the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1797)|
| 0:30:00| to deny the proposed planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| because it is incompatible with the sector plan and adjacent land uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| I am, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1814)|
| 0:30:17| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Would you like to defer, Councilor Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| Please state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| Kyle Swift, 12747 Shady Ridge Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| My property is directly adjacent to this on the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| I know that the council for the applicant sent a letter to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| to address some of the issues in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| and I'd just like to speak to a few of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| First, there are some issues with access to the property in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| and the applicant has mentioned the possibility of using Long Ridge Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| a cut-through on a portion that's owned by the Saddle Ridge Homeowners Association for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| And I can't speak officially for the Saddle Ridge HOA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| but I can assure you that the neighbors in Saddle Ridge would not approve a cut-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| from Long Ridge Road to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Secondly, they mentioned that the two acres that were recently sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| that a water tower has been built on that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| It's actually incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| It's an existing water tower that's been there for several decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| but FUD has said they do not have any immediate plans to build a second water tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1890)|
| 0:31:36| They bought those two acres with the intention of potentially needing to do so in the next five to ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1896)|
| 0:31:43| But finally, I think most concerning for those of us in the neighborhood is the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| They mentioned their desire to cluster housing away from the steeper slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| As you know in the report, there's approximately 18 acres that are less than 25 or 15 degree slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1914)|
| 0:32:02| I forget exactly which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| But if this plan was approved and they want to build all 205 of those units on that 18 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1924)|
| 0:32:13| that's a density of approximately 11 units per acre concentrated right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| Now, coincidentally, that flattest part of this property is directly behind our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| So if this plan was approved, we would have density behind us essentially to that of an apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| which is really fundamentally no different from the original plan that was withdrawn for MDR last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1961)|
| 0:32:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| We had reduced our application previously to ask this to be rezoned from planned commercial to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1974)|
| 0:33:04| medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1984)|
| 0:33:08| Essentially our application is to move from one planned zone to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1988)|
| 0:33:11| This property was rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| It's 41.08 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| It was rezoned in 2001 to planned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| And I think that was the wrong choice for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| In fact, planning staff and both planning recommend the planning commission recommended denial of the planned commercial back in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2005)|
| 0:33:33| And the county commission at that time approved it despite the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| And what we're essentially trying to do, instead of trying to develop it consistent with the planned commercial zoning that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| is to change it, to down zone it from the planned commercial and do something to planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| which is eminently more compatible to the single family residential units there at Saddle Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2032)|
| 0:34:02| If you look at the sector plan first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| staff has issued an opinion that the sector plan designation of low density residential is incompatible with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2045)|
| 0:34:14| And respectfully, I have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| There is low density residential sector plan designation to the property immediately to the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2057)|
| 0:34:26| That is zoned at PR1 to 3 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| All of Saddle Ridge is in Farragut, but their comprehensive land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| it is also the equivalent of the Knox County's for low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| So the sector plan to the east, south, and west is consistent with the sector plan that we're asking this body to approve today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2081)|
| 0:34:49| low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| And the zoning is the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| If you look at the zoning map in place, you have planned residential 1 to 3 dwelling units an acre on the parcel to the southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| You go a little further, you have PR at 1 to 9 dwelling units an acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| You're moving further west towards Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| And again, the R2 is Farragut's zoning for a single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| There's the Farragut OSR, which is that large track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| That's the Farragut's equivalent of the planned residential where you can allow the cluster development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| for the same reasons the planned residential allows that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| So because when you have environmental constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| it does more damage to land to try to divvy it out in lots across the entire parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| because you're dealing with environmental constraints such as the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| such as potential sinkhole issues, which I understand are part and Farragut of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2142)|
| 0:35:47| It's not part of the zoning application, but it is part of Mr. Siddiqui's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| It may have some sinkholes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| So we're asking to apply low density residential to the entire parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| but try to come up with a plan that will allow us to build in the areas where it makes sense to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| And right now we're just asking for permission to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| We're asking for permission to try to solve some of the issues with regard to the sewer access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2167)|
| 0:36:12| which we know there's going to have to be at least 3,500 feet of sewer run to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| And that's consistent with whatever is done, whether it's developed consistent with this planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| or if it's developed consistently with the surrounding properties and low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| There's access issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| We do currently have access to Palestine Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| Now, Palestine Lane, I do want to point out, isn't tiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| It's until you get to go to Ariel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| I think you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| Palestine Lane runs from the interchange of what road all the way down to the Old Dominion Terminal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2200)|
| 0:36:48| And throughout that entire area, it's 22 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| It addresses the commercial traffic that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| It's only once you get past the entrance of the terminal there that it drops down into an 11-foot wide road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2215)|
| 0:37:03| That will have to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| No matter what use goes on here, that will need to be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Palestine Lane does terminate before our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2228)|
| 0:37:11| but there is a reserved easement that allows us to access that property from Palestine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| So we have a legal right to access Palestine Road at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| And once we know what we can do with the property, we can take the time to try to intentionally plan different access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| There is potential cross connectivity through the other residential neighborhoods once they're developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| that may go straight out to Watt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2255)|
| 0:37:38| The justification for the sector plan amendment is that the general commercial sector plan in that area is an error,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| and it's more consistent with the surrounding properties that go to Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| And that's the same justification for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| In fact, when the property to the southwest, the LDR there on the map, was rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| it was originally zoned Planned Commercial, and it was rezoned to Planned Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| And at that time, staff said this recommendation will remove 25 acres of inappropriate PC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2279)|
| 0:38:05| I think the PC zoning is inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| I think it would be vastly more compatible to allow us to develop it as Low Density Residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| So respectfully, I ask that you approve the application for the sector plan amendment to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2294)|
| 0:38:19| and PR up to five dwelling units an acre, which is consistent with that sector plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2304)|
| 0:38:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| I believe Commissioner Phillips had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Go ahead, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| I did, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| I had a question about the access down Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I mean, do you have actual deeded access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| We actually have deeded access, so there's a reserved easement to allow us to access that property from Palestine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| And do you know how wide that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Mr. Rodner, do you have it here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| It's 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| I looked it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| Yeah, it is a 50-foot right-of-way easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| So there's plenty of room to improve that to county standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| And, you know, just to comment in general, planned residential zone, I mean, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| is really designed to work with slopes where you can take any densities and try to put them on the flatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2350)|
| 0:39:18| It actually encourages that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| So I would be in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2362)|
| 0:39:25| Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| A question for staff, either Liz or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| It was rezoned back in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| Was it consistent with the sector plan or was the sector plan amended afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2377)|
| 0:39:44| It was not consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| The sector plan was amended as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| It was originally ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2389)|
| 0:39:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Was the sector plan changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| With the rezoning in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| With the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| I didn't get the opposition's name, and I wanted to ask a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| Mr. Swift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Under the current zoning and plan under general commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2412)|
| 0:40:18| there's quite a few things that could go on back there that might be less becoming around your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2418)|
| 0:40:27| Are you aware of that, and have you taken that into consideration?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2427)|
| 0:40:32| Yes, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| I think most of us, when we purchased our houses, knew what that property was zoned for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2433)|
| 0:40:40| In 2001, when it was rezoned to plan commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| that was done with the caveat that there would be a 300-foot vegetative buffer between our properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2444)|
| 0:40:52| and any development that would be added on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2452)|
| 0:40:58| and that 300-foot buffer encompasses most of the area that is flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| If you look at the satellite view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| it's actually pretty much everything from the north side of that water tower parallel to the bottom of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2466)|
| 0:41:13| That's about 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| We knew that there was the possibility, but we would also have quite a large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2475)|
| 0:41:22| approximately an acre or so buffer of woods, which were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2482)|
| 0:41:27| The property's been logged since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| But we knew what was there, but there would be that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2489)|
| 0:41:38| It's unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| It really is unusual for a neighborhood adjacent to a piece of property to be opposing basically a downgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| from plan commercial to low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| I've been here a long time, and I guess I've not seen much of that go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2511)|
| 0:41:56| So I was just curious if you'd consider what actually could happen back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2516)|
| 0:42:02| I'm not sure I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| I think that a piece of property should have never been a planned commercial piece of property myself either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2525)|
| 0:42:18| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| Mr. Chairman, I'll make a motion to approve CG, general commercial, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| plan commercial, I'm sorry, low-density residential, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| PR, planned residential, density of five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2557)|

| 0:42:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2568)|

| 0:43:06| that it's adjacent to a residential area and topographically more suitable for residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| versus a commercial designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips to approve the sector plan to LDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2598)|

| 0:43:31| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2611)|

| 0:43:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2623)|

| 0:44:06| Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| We have one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2651)|
| 0:44:12| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2652)|
| 0:44:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2657)|
| 0:44:23| Moving on to item 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2663)|
| 0:44:30| Counselor, keep me straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| I overlooked one today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| I'm working off two different sheets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2673)|
| 0:44:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| It's item number 17, applicant Linda Nations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| Location, east side of Shannon Lane, north of Taylor Ford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2683)|
| 0:44:49| Track size, 1.23 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Present plan designation zoning is agricultural, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2691)|
| 0:44:58| Proposed plan designation zoning is low-density residential, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| And the existing land use is single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| The staff recommendation is to deny the sector plan amendment to LDR and hillside protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| because it is inconsistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| And the second motion would be to deny the RA low-density residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| because it is inconsistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| Please state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2733)|
| 0:45:35| Linda Nations, 6626 Shannon Lane in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Seeing no opposition, please proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| I have owned this property for 20-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| It is currently zoned one home per acre, but there's always been two homes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2750)|
| 0:45:57| So I just would like the zoning to match the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| There's two homes, and I intend to split that parcel into two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2761)|
| 0:46:06| And if it's zoned two homes per acre, then I can have six tenths for one home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| and seven tenths for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| I also own two adjoining properties, and both of those properties are also zoned two homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| There will not be any additional homes put on either one of these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| and there will not be any increased traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| It's been the same as it's always been for 20-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| Thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Open it up to the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Carol, entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| I've got a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| So I guess we talked about this at agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| but there's nothing that can be done so that she can subdivide this property without rezoning it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2822)|
| 0:47:03| Unfortunately, the planned residential zone district does not allow mobile homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| and so the RA zoning that she's requesting would be her only option to be able to have a mobile home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2828)|
| 0:47:17| on one of those pieces of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| Is there anything she could do to the construction of the mobile home in order for it to not qualify as a mobile home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2840)|
| 0:47:26| I'd have to defer to Knox County codes for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| Mobile homes are disallowed in the zone, so she could do a manufactured home but not a mobile home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| But she couldn't convert it to a manufactured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| I guess it would have to be a different home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| So is there currently a mobile home there that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2866)|
| 0:47:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| Unfortunately, there's not nothing we could do for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2868)|
| 0:47:56| I did have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| Bear with us just a minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2880)|
| 0:48:01| Give me just a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2883)|
| 0:48:17| Speak loudly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Try Vice Chair Utens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| See if his will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| You can come over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| Speak closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| I think at this point to try to sell or upgrade the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| because most lending institutions will want the property subdivided into another lot separate from the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2926)|
| 0:48:53| I think it's more appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| This is more of a commission decision than it is staff to maybe deviate from the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2936)|
| 0:49:04| And I think this is a particular case that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2944)|
| 0:49:08| So given the existing layout of the property and that we already have two units on one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2948)|
| 0:49:15| so essentially you're still getting the same density, not changing anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| I would recommend or I'd make a motion that we approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| to low density residential hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| We have a motion to approve the sector plan amendment to LDR and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| seconded by Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2978)|
| 0:49:43| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2983)|
| 0:49:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to approve RA, low density residential zoning for the sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=2993)|
| 0:50:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3003)|
| 0:50:04| We have a motion to approve the RA low density residential by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| seconded by Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3019)|
| 0:50:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3021)|
| 0:50:22| Does that mean it's now two homes per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Well, you have to go through county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3028)|
| 0:50:30| I don't plan on any additional homes, no additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| I just want to split it into two parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| We just recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| We recommended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| The county commission has to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3043)|
| 0:50:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| All right, moving along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Agenda item number 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Applicant, Masana Investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| Location, east side of Fox Road, south of Castle Glen Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| Approximate size of the track, 22.52 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| Present zoning, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| Zoning requested, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Existing land use, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| And the density proposed, five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3070)|
| 0:51:14| Staff recommendation is to approve planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3074)|
| 0:51:18| at a density of three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| because it is consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| and surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| Drew Statton, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3090)|
| 0:51:37| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| Applicant may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| Well, first of all, thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| In our analysis and further research of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3106)|
| 0:51:49| after looking at the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| I also want to take into account the other, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| planned residential rezonings that are kind of in that aerial view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3115)|
| 0:51:58| You've got three, 3.24, and under the interstate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| it's a little bit higher, some more to the south, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| Those, I just want to make a note, those were rezoned back in 99,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| 2002, and I believe 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| and so a lot's changed in the housing market since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| as I think we can all agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| So we took that into account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| The price of land in this market and in this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| being in the heart of West Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| we think a higher density is justified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| That and just the broad strokes need for more density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3141)|
| 0:52:24| and more housing in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| So with that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| we respectfully request four dwelling units per acre versus the three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| that staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Commissioner's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3158)|
| 0:52:39| How about Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| Excuse me, I didn't turn it off previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| I'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3165)|
| 0:52:46| Yeah, so for everything that the applicant said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| you know, you're sitting right at Pellissippi Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| close to Kingston Pike, and there is stuff popping out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| It's in a great school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| You've got access to infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| and you're on a, I'm assuming it's a collector road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| or if it's not, it's a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| And there is density on the other side of Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3185)|
| 0:53:10| that would be consistent with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| So I would make a motion that we approve planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| up to four per the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Okay, we have a motion from Vice Chair Uten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| to approve four dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| seconded by Commissioner Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| Commissioner Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| I was just going to probably make that motion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| But just in general, with the density in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| I definitely agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| I would support it at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| I mean, I think it's, the road's wide enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| Fox Road is a direct shot to Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| It's in really good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| There's a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| When you get up ultimately to Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| there's a way to get there to pull out safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| So I'm on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| Seeing no other lights, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3243)|

| 0:54:06| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3246)|
| 0:54:17| All right, moving on to agenda item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| This will require three motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| We have subdivision Zenith Homes on Rifle Range Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3265)|
| 0:54:30| The applicant is Zenith Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| Location, north side of Rifle Range Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3273)|

| 0:54:38| Approximate acreage, 6.52 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Zoning, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| Existing land use, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Proposed use, attached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| Number of lots, 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| This will require some variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| Looks like two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| And alternative design standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| The staff recommendation is to approve the requested variance two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3311)|
| 0:55:17| and the alternative design standards based on the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| of the Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| because the proposal will not create a safety hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| The second motion is to approve the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| The third motion is to approve the development plan for a 27-lot subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| and reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet along the eastern boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3342)|

| 0:55:58| Seeing no opposition, you may proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| David Harbin, 4334 Paper Mill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3362)|

| 0:56:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| Let me add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| On that first motion, I overlooked the paragraph that states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3377)|
| 0:56:23| deny variance request one due to the significant slope present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3383)|
| 0:56:30| where Road A meets Rifle Range Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| and how that would impact potential road widening of Rifle Range Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| should that occur in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| So that's what we have in the recommendation of the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Am I clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3404)|

| 1:00:17| It's a growing area and we believe we've got a good plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| and it will hopefully encourage some pedestrian connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| with the Temple campuses that are across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3625)|

| 1:02:00| Next agenda item is number 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| The applicant is Blue Water Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Location, north side of Mascot Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| west side of Emerald Mine Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| Approximate size of track, 49.12 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| Current zoning is industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Existing land use, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3736)|
| 1:02:19| Proposed use, expansion of existing surface mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| Plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3742)|
| 1:02:25| The staff recommendation is to approve the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| to expand the existing surface mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| and mineral extraction operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| as described in the mining plan of operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3752)|
| 1:02:36| amendment one, for BWI Midway Quarry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| subject to eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| The applicant present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| We are Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| Would you like to defer, Counselor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| Actually, I'll go first really quickly on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| Staff has recommended approval subject to eight conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| and we're in agreement with the eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| This is a plan of operations expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| for our existing quarry that's been permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| and approved out there since,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| I think, correct me, since at least 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| But I want to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| the expansion isn't to do any more quarrying or mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| We are just expanding where we can put our overburden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| So we're going to take the overburden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| from what we're doing that we can't use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3807)|
| 1:03:29| and be able to expand that onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| So there's not going to be any more additional blasting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| or excavating from this expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| So if we are going to try to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| where we're actually quarrying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3821)|
| 1:03:43| we'll have to come back through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| with another plan of operations for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| So I do know there's some concerns out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| because of some other underground mining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| that has occurred historically in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| that may have caused some issues with some properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| and we'll be glad to address those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| if there's any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3844)|
| 1:04:07| Please state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| Steve Nevers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| I live at 10124 Arnold Lane in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| My property is directly attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| to the end of the quarry's property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| I just want to speak with you today real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| on actually multiple issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| So it was said that this is just for the expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3862)|
| 1:04:25| of what they call, I believe, an overburdened storage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| This overburdened storage area currently is a cattle field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| They're proposing to add what they call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| equivalent to the Sturkey Lofts building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| It's another 140 foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| putting it at a total of 1,120 feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| That's over half of the height of House Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| to give you a little, I guess, guide as to how large that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| It's going to be a massive eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| It's going to reduce our property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| In addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| it was said that there's no more quarrying or mining to be going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| but the 1986 extension, as far as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| is going to be blasting directly behind our homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| approximately a couple hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| That is that 300 acres directly to the left, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| They've already started clear-cutting those woods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| It's approximately 300 acres of woods that's being clear-cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| We have multiple concerns about that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| and that location they're discussing is the overburdened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3917)|
| 1:05:21| or excuse me, the overburdened storage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| where they're going to put all of the non-usable rock material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| So that quarry on the south side of Mascot Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| has been in operation for 65 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| so I'm assuming the north side directly behind our home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| would be blasting for the next 65 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| putting me at about 100 years old by the time they're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| We already rattle our house so violently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3941)|
| 1:05:43| While deployed, I felt a 500-pound bomb detonate within a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3943)|
| 1:05:48| It is violently more aggressive than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| It shakes our home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| The depth at what they're blasting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| I'm concerned about water contamination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| I'm concerned we're all on well water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| We don't have city water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| If something runs off, if we lose our water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3959)|
| 1:06:02| we can't water our livestock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| At what point do we know if it's contaminated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Am I giving my son contaminated water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| This is the onus on us for our foundation issues from blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| What about our water pollution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| It's caused multiple issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| and if that blasting is to continue north of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| even though this is the amendment for the overburden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| where they'll be placing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| then that is really a massive issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| If this was approved in October of 1986,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| which, you know, to give you a little, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| guidance on how long ago that was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| it was seven years before we had the Internet accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| That was the same year the Challenger exploded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| Many things have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| The ownership of this property has changed several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| as well as the mineral rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| and it has caused other multiple issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| just with their blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| I would like to oppose that overburden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| I would like to oppose and reevaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| their current blasting permit that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| that close to our homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| and would be happy to discuss it with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| or work with them in any way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| I'd like to defer the rest of my time to Savannah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4031)|
| 1:07:19| My name is Savannah Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| I live at 1945 Whirlwind Way in Mascot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I want to bring up the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| that the owners of the mineral rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| have changed significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| since the approval of that blasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| In fact, that company filed for bankruptcy in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| and under the ownership of the mineral rights now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| there is a clause in that contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| that says they are not liable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| for any past, present, or future damages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4067)|
| 1:07:50| And I know that because their tunnel collapsed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| on my property earlier this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| And when I invited them out to see if they would help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| they said that they were not going to help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| that the entire town is going to fall in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| because they are not liable for any of those claims.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| And in fact, they told me that it was Blue Water's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4084)|
| 1:08:08| Now, I'm not blaming you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| especially because it actually happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| that Blue Water is donating a lot of the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| to help me right now, which I greatly appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| but the plain fact is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4096)|
| 1:08:17| the tunnels under that road are not secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4097)|
| 1:08:19| The road itself falls in every two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| and all of the properties that TDEC told me this morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| are most at risk are north of Mascot Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| which just so happens to be closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| to that blast site than even I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| And if the cracks in the bedrock throughout those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| are as bad as the ones that were on mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4115)|
| 1:08:37| that have devastated our entire road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| then all of those families are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| And that is the area that is a dense neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| It's near our only library, our only post office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| our only playground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4131)|
| 1:08:53| That's our entire town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| So I just hope that you guys can take that into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| because we're all really scared and working on it already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| but, you know, just want to let you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| I'm familiar with Browning's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| and the company she's talking about is NYSTAR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| They did underground mining there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| and there has been a sinkhole opened up on her property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| and that's not because of anything with regard to this quarry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4164)|
| 1:09:28| We have been blasting there since 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Blasting standards aren't subject to local regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| There are state standards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| That preempt local regulations from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| and we've been meeting that since 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| You know, this is just an expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| to be able to put our overburden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| I was a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| The overburden is not going to be 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| It's allowed to the approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| the 1,120-foot elevation line, the contour line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| which is 141 feet higher than the property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| That's as tall as it could go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| but there's going to be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| This condition is a 15-foot-wide Type A landscaping screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| along the Mascot Road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| You know, we meet all the regulations for the expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4209)|
| 1:10:12| We're not expanding the actual area that's going to be blasted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| and, you know, the other issues out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| I mean, that's not from this company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| and it's not, you know, because of anything we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| And, you know, if there's concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| we have representatives from Blue Water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| that would be happy to meet with anybody in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| give them their cell phone numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| If they have concerns about anything that goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| There are other mining operations in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| Other things have been blasted in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| So, you know, we've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| We've been in Knox County for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| We've been operating this mine for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| We do a good job, and we meet all the regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| So we would ask you to follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| and approve this expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Still doing underground mining at this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4263)|
| 1:11:05| No, no, we're not an underground mining operation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| It's just strictly the quarry that you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| the pits and the area that we're excavating there on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Can I still use the remaining two minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| to answer a few questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4277)|
| 1:11:19| You'll have to come up to the podium so we can hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| I'm Jeff Ferrell with Blue Water Industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| 1657 Christian Bend Road, Churchill, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| There's a number of things that are getting conflated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Number one, NISTAR is the zinc mining operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| that do the shafts underground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Blue Water Industries is not affiliated, associated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| connected to NISTAR in any way, shape, or manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| This quarry has actually been in operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| since the late 1950s, best we can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| So we've been active in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| The area across the road has been permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| as they said, since 1986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| So we're not here asking for anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| extra related to our mining activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| We simply acquired this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| subsequent to the approval of the plan of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| So we're simply asking to use this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| to take the spools off of the area we're going to mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| and getting ready to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| And store it on this adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| that we don't have the ability to mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| because we don't have the mineral rights on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4347)|
| 1:12:29| We strictly have surface rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| So this request is nothing more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| to either put the overburden on the 300 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| or to move it to this adjacent property while we're mining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4356)|
| 1:12:40| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| What happens after you say you're going to store it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Is that a permanent storage of the overburden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| Or is it something you go back later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4369)|
| 1:12:51| to restore the property that you mined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| If there's any reclamation required in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| they'll probably use that material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| to reclaim the quarries up on closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4377)|
| 1:12:59| But otherwise it stays there? It's permanent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| And you really can't see it in the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| but there's an overburden pile on the south side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| right there in that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| that has been there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| And you stabilize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| I mean, everything is stabilized as you move it there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4393)|
| 1:13:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| We're required to vegetate it to a degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| to make sure that it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4399)|
| 1:13:21| Who oversees that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| Is that the Office of Surface Mining,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| or is it somebody else that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| oversees that operation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| I'm Walt Hillis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| I'm the environmental manager of Blue Water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| I live at 2320 Brighton Farms Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4415)|
| 1:13:37| in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| The agency that oversees that is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| It used to be the State of Tennessee TDAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| the Division of Water Resources Mining Section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| Within the last two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| they have become their own division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4427)|
| 1:13:49| It's now the Division of Mineral and Geologic Resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4429)|
| 1:13:51| who permits us and oversees that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| So they would oversee any runoff or any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| with the mountain moving and that kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| For water control and discharge, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Just a real quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| How many years do you expect it will take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| to get it up to the 141 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| What is our mine plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| We haven't done that detailed of a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| but it'll be in...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| It'll be in stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| I mean, we're not going to go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| and strip the whole area at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| We'll strip and mine some and then strip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| So it'll be consecutive over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| the life of the mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| We're talking about decades maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| 10 years, more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| And it'll still be a couple years probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| before we start active mining on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| You know, nobody wants a quarry in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| But, you know, we do have a need for this kind of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| and we need material for development of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-220908?start=4504)|
