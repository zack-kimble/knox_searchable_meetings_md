| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Board of Education's February 7th, 2022 work session meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=30)|
| 0:00:40| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=40)|
| 0:00:45| Please face the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=45)|
| 0:01:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=60)|
| 0:01:22| Thank you. I would like to recognize our mayor. Mayor Jacobs is out in the audience tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=82)|
| 0:01:29| I don't know if we have any other elected officials here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=89)|
| 0:01:36| As public notice, the Board met in Executive Session this afternoon at 4.30 p.m. with members from the Knox County Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=96)|
| 0:01:43| Mr. Dupler, would you share information regarding Executive Sessions and the Open Meetings Act, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=103)|
| 0:01:49| Yes. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| Executive Session is an exception to the Open Meetings Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| It's not an opportunity for the Board to deliberate at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| It's simply for a conversation between our law department and the Board and to discuss litigation and proposed litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=119)|
| 0:02:10| And that is pursuant to Smith County Education versus Anderson and some other cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=130)|
| 0:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=138)|
| 0:02:20| Are there any requested changes to this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| A motion by Ms. Horne, a second by Mr. Watson. All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| So we do have a presentation from Knox County and Knoxville, Knox County Planning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=157)|
| 0:02:44| Mr. Oaks? Or Mayor Jacobs? Mayor Jacobs, he's telling me this is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=164)|
| 0:03:05| Thank you, Ms. Chairwoman. Glenn Jacobs, Knox County Mayor, 400 Main Street here in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| Knox County has not updated our comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Actually, it's our growth policy plan and general plan going on 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| This has caused a lot of issues just overall when we look at everything from land use to infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| And currently we have a growth policy plan, a general plan, and then sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| They're all kind of smaller versions of the plan above them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| But in many cases, because of amendments made to the various plans, they don't align.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| And that's caused a lot of issues when we look at rezonings and those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=224)|
| 0:03:50| So we've begun the process of developing a new comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=230)|
| 0:03:56| which will also include a master transportation plan and will also have a master parks plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=236)|
| 0:04:01| Schools are an important part of this and traditionally probably have not really been that involved in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| So we're really looking forward to having schools involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| Russ Oaks is on one of the committees as well as infrastructure and facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=252)|
| 0:04:19| Obviously, when we're looking at where we can have population growth, where we can sustain population growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| and those sort of things, schools are an important part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| So thank you for your input on that, and we very much look forward to working with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| We have here tonight Manny Benedict from my office, Jim Snowden, who is Senior Director of Knox County Engineering and Public Works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=273)|
| 0:04:40| Amy Brooks, who is Executive Director of Knox County, Knoxville Planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| as well as Jamie Green, who is with Planning Next, who is one of the consultants on this endeavor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| We went through a procurement process for a consultant, because obviously it takes a lot of bandwidth to put this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| Came up with Kimberly Horn, who won the bid for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| They are very well thought of in this space, so we're excited about all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| Of course, there's going to be lots of community input in this process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| So again, we're just appreciative of schools being involved in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| and at this point I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Green from Planning Next to talk about how this process will go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| As the mayor said, my name is Jamie Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| I'm a principal with Planning Next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| We're based in Columbus, Ohio, but work around the country helping communities shape their future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| especially as it relates to how they're going to grow and develop in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=344)|
| 0:05:50| So as the mayor said, I'm going to give you just a brief overview about this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| and if there are questions, we'll take those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| He mentioned Kimberly Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| They're one of our partners in this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| In addition to Kimberly Horn, we have Ninigrit Partners, which is an economic consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| We believe strongly you shouldn't be making land use and development policy without understanding the underlying economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| We also have a group with us called Urban Three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| and they look at the fiscal implications of how you're growing and developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| Not all development pays for itself, and so they're there to look at it with us as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| And then we have locally someone you may be familiar with, Cannon & Cannon, who are helping us with this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| So the term comprehensive plan is used a lot differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| but for us and how we're working here with the planning staff is that it really is a blueprint for the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| how it's going to be laid out and described in goals and strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| For us, those are projects, policies, and programs that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| It really is also a thought of as a compass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| How is this going to provide direction for decision making on how money is allocated for capital improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=422)|
| 0:07:10| for rezonings, operating budgets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| But it should inform all of that other really important work if it's institutionalized in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| We think about it also as a playbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Like once you figure out where you want to go and what you want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| how do you go about securing funding and shaping policy to make that a reality?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| And then we also think that it's really important that there is an understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=451)|
| 0:07:37| understanding by groups like yours about what the county is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| what the vision is and how that's going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| especially the private sector and development in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=464)|
| 0:07:48| Our experience is that in many places what developers want most is predictability in what is being expected of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=468)|
| 0:07:58| And so this is an opportunity, as the mayor said the first time in 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| to rearticulate what's really important in terms of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| So the key parts of this, the comprehensive plan, there are a lot of sub-elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| but I want you to think about land use being a critical one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=493)|
| 0:08:18| The choices that a community makes to serve it with utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=498)|
| 0:08:21| it drives how you need to serve it with transportation, but it also drives the economics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=501)|
| 0:08:28| The transportation and mobility issues are likewise a critical agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| because people are going to live here, going to move here, going to invest here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| How do they get around and how does that transportation make sense with the land use issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=516)|
| 0:08:44| There is a parks and recreation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| We know that that's really important to members of your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| That work is well underway right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| but it will be seamlessly integrated into the land use and transportation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| So, you know, you might or you should wonder why the county is updating the plan now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| In a lot of places, South Carolina, for example, you have to update your plan every 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=550)|
| 0:09:17| create a new plan, and update it in the intervening five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| 20 is longer than most, I think, would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| So we think that it's well overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| A generation since the last plan was there, and if you just pause for a couple of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=567)|
| 0:09:33| and think about what has changed in Knox County in the last 20 years, it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| So this is an effort to sort of bring that up to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| We think that the reason it's being done right now is because of the change that I just alluded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| The plan should be the basis for organizing and managing the change in a way that you want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| not just being reactive to what's actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| The growth, we're going to be doing a good analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| but intuitively you probably know that there's a lot of growth unprecedented here in the county that's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=602)|
| 0:10:09| And I think also, you know, there's an opportunity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| It's very competitive out there to attract and retain talent in communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| It's very challenged to attract and retain good business investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| This planning process can be a tool and a step to actually having that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| I think the other thing that's kind of related to some of these items up here, like change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| is that there are some really strong phenomenon happening in our country around demographics, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=633)|
| 0:10:40| where people are choosing to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Some of that accelerated by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| Those changes, changes in retail, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| what is actually happening about how people want to get their goods and services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| There are things that are happening out there that will impact Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| and we want to use this updating process to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| Okay, now this is a lot of text here for you, but what we're hoping to achieve with the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| with stakeholders here in the community, are a number of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=665)|
| 0:11:09| Economics being one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| There's so much that is possible when there are good fundamental economics in your land use policies and choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=671)|
| 0:11:20| Resiliency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=680)|
| 0:11:21| We want to make sure that decisions we're making also are considering what's happening in the natural environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=681)|
| 0:11:29| You have extraordinary natural environment in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| We took a tour a couple months ago, and it's amazing what's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=691)|
| 0:11:36| So how do you integrate that in a resilient way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Workforce advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| Clearly you want opportunities where people are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| You want people to go where there is talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| You know, it's really clear right now that businesses, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| used to just locate where they were and expected people to come to them, even if it was in, you know, Dubuque, Iowa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| Now it's just the opposite, where businesses go where they find talent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=715)|
| 0:11:58| And so we want to work this plan and the quality of place around workforce advancement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| Likewise around affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| You know, there isn't a market we work in right now that doesn't have housing and affordability challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=727)|
| 0:12:12| This plan can be a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=732)|
| 0:12:14| And ultimately, prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=734)|
| 0:12:17| How do all these things, you know, sort of wind up in a place where it really yields a more efficient connected place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| and connects people, places, and prosperity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| So this is a timeline about our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| And you can see that back in November we started getting organized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| And we're now working our way into some really important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| So there are three middle blocks up there about the content of the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| State of the county, like trying to understand what the conditions and the trends are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| We're really clear that it's important to know what the conditions and trends are, but they're not your destiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| Know what they are, but develop plans and policies to sustain the ones you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| or to bend the arc of some of those others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| We're going to go into a process once we've, you know, done that to create some scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| What are the choices and the implications of different ways that you might grow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| And then we'll move into the really important work of drafting recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| You'll see the three large components on the bottom are the rounds of engagement that we're going to facilitate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| We believe strongly that the best plans are those that integrate not only the technical work that's up above,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| but the intuition that people have by virtue of living, working in a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=807)|
| 0:13:33| And so that will take us to a point where we'll have a final plan documenting the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| and going through the process of adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| So who's involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=821)|
| 0:13:43| There are eight buckets that we think about here in terms of who's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| There is an advisory committee that's really close to being formed and launched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=828)|
| 0:13:53| that's going to help guide the process and the substance and take a leadership role in committee engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=833)|
| 0:14:00| There's a technical committee that is being organized, a group of stakeholders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| some of which we're starting to interview tomorrow, and then there's the general public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| which is providing us the basic input and feedback based on what they know about this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| There are some subcommittees already around schools and utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| The county planning and staff is really like the critical coordinator of all this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| The elected officials that are really going to get a briefing tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| but also their role is to help monitor this process and then be in a position to adopt it when we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| And then the consultants, we're really here for process leadership and expertise that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=879)|
| 0:14:45| This is not our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| In many ways, we're a facilitator of your opportunities and your values here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| so we see ourselves working in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| In terms of what's happening, we took this tour in December that I mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=896)|
| 0:15:01| There's a report being prepared right now that you might have some interest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| but it's about the state of the county where we're looking across a number of critical topics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=906)|
| 0:15:10| and trying to identify where you are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| What's the starting point from moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| There was branding work initiated and finalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| and you'll see that really in the heart of the communications plan and the logo that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=918)|
| 0:15:24| and then the website and engagement kickoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| So we are working on the tools necessary to give anybody who cares about the future of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| the chance to participate in this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| And you can see on the right-hand side of the screen a very simple statement that we've, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| that really tries to capture what we're up to here with this effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| So I mentioned a couple slides ago that there are really three critical parts of this engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=950)|
| 0:15:57| There's the listening and learning, which for us is about generating ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| It's not taking out, like, our ideas or the staff's ideas and say, don't you like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| It's actually going out to them and finding out what's important to them that we can then build on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| when we start developing goals and choosing potential directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| which is the core of the second round about making choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| And then that third round is, you know, it's iterative, so they're all building on each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| So affirming and prioritizing what happens is that last round with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| before we put, you know, the final document together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| So in terms of listening and learning, there are conversations that have, you know, started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| and they're continuing, you know, today and tomorrow with the stakeholder interviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| and the technical advisory committee, technical committee and the advisory committee together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| And then in March, there will be the countywide engagement for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And I want you to think about, like, the engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| It's just not like a one-shot deal, like, come tonight and tell us and we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| It's multiple in-person meetings and then the ability to participate online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| and then the ability to take what we call a meeting in a box and go out to where people are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| We do exit questionnaires after our meetings and we learn who's there and who's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| And we then try to go find them where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1044)|
| 0:17:31| So I want to thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1051)|
| 0:17:34| I'd like everybody here tonight to feel some responsibility to get involved in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| especially this active group on my left over here, the United Methodist Women's Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| We want them involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| We want everybody to get involved in this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| and feel like they have a chance to shape the future of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| the first chance they've had in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| Ms. Babb, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| Yes, when you're talking about these meetings in March, how does the public find out about them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| Is there a website or is it the Knox County website?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| Yeah, there will be a web presence for those particular meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| There will be press releases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| There will be flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| So we've got a number of things in our marketing plan that are going to try to elevate the awareness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1096)|
| 0:18:22| But our experience is that that helps create awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| but it doesn't necessarily deliver people to a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| So we're actually identifying people, starting with the advisory group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| who will use a word-of-mouth approach to invite people to come to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| So there will be a dozen different ways to learn about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| And one other question I had, you were talking about like in South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| they don't wait 20 years to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Will that be part of this process, deciding if we need to do it more often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| or putting a process in to do this more often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Yeah, I think that is not only a great question, it's a great recommendation for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| We're not there, but when we get to that last part of the plan where we think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1141)|
| 0:19:06| okay, so this is what we want to do, then there is important questions about how are we going to manage this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| And one of our basic management pieces is to do an annual report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| Not an annual report of the county, but an annual report of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| And in that annual report, you track progress about how we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| But I think it's really reasonable that you would also put something there that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| this plan should be evaluated for an update every ten years or whatever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| And I think there should be an expectation that you formalize how you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| It's good stewardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| It's not anything onerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| It's just what I think you should do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Some of you, well, you must have your own plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| but be involved in organizations and businesses where you develop a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and you live the plan and you update it as you need, but sooner as opposed to later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Mayor Jacobs mentioned the linkage with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| and specifically Russ Oaks already serving on a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| Do you anticipate other linkages with Knox County Schools in the planning process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| So what we would love to know, you know, what your current projections are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| geographically dispersed across, where are you expecting growth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| We'd like to compare notes on those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| We'd like to know what your general facility, you know, ambitions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1225)|
| 0:20:30| You know, when we were touring around, we saw several new facilities I think out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1230)|
| 0:20:36| We don't know, the staff might know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| but we'd love to know like where those things are being positioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| because they must be magnets for people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| want to live close to schools has been my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| But we'd love to be able to do that on a, I guess, a staff level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1246)|
| 0:20:51| So any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| For taking the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Superintendent Thomas, do you have a report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| A few updates for you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| I'd like to begin by pointing out that February is Black History Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| This is an important opportunity to celebrate the black educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| who've achieved great things at KCS in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| and are doing outstanding work in the present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| We also want to recognize and honor the achievements of our nation's black leaders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| who have served an important role throughout history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1285)|
| 0:21:28| The diversity of our school communities is one of our strengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1288)|
| 0:21:31| and we will continue working to build a culture that celebrates diversity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1291)|
| 0:21:35| and ensures all our staff, students, and families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| that they feel supported and empowered to succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| I also want to offer congratulations to the nearly 200 educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| who are being honored this week as KCS Teachers of the Year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| Tomorrow evening, we will hold a celebration dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| at the Knoxville Convention Center where teachers from each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| will be recognized along with district-wide winners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| for our elementary, middle, and high school grade bands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| I've said many times that Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1321)|
| 0:22:03| has the best teachers of any district in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| and I look forward to our celebration with them tomorrow evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| Finally, I want to let our community know that KCS will host| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| two recruitment events in the coming weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| Our virtual recruitment fair will take place on Saturday, February 26,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1335)|
| 0:22:20| and an in-person recruitment fair will take place on Saturday, March 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1340)|

| 0:22:29| We will look forward to visiting with many outstanding candidates in these sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1349)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you, Madam Chair. That concludes my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Thank you, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| Next, we have our Priority High School Readiness Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| I think Dr. Reisweg is this you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| I'm going to call Dr. Dexter Murphy and Dr. Keith Wilson up to do this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| They'll give you a little background on how we plan to update the board every month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| on kind of ESSER progress in the four priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1377)|
| 0:23:01| so they'll talk through that process as well as update you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| on one of those priorities tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| All right. Good afternoon, Madam Chair and the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| My name is Dr. Dexter Murphy, former fifth grade principal, former assistant principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| former principal, former NIT consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Now I'm back as a director of ESSER programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| so I'm glad to be back with Knox County Schools serving this capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| I come to you this afternoon with our first of many monthly implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| and monitoring updates around our district priorities currently funded through ESSER 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| Just first of all, because this is our first update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1414)|
| 0:23:37| it's going to take a bit more time to kind of lay out the foundation of our implementation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| so I just ask for your patience in the up and coming months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| Once we lay out this plan today, it will be more brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| and we'll have more brevity within our updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| so I just ask for your patience with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1430)|
| 0:23:54| Okay. As you see here, we have our KCS vision for ESSER funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| and if you look at that and read our vision here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1438)|
| 0:24:01| there are several words or several phrases that stick out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| A is all students across all schools and also all student groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| but more importantly, ensuring that they thrive in grade level and post-graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| which is what these funds are used for, not just the funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| but looking strategically how we can use these funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| to make sure we're doing that in a sustainable manner as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Okay. Here you have, there we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| here you have KCS must first focus on the short-term and long-term response to student outcome and gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| You know, we're in a unique situation and circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| where, as an educational system, we A, have to ask ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1473)|
| 0:24:37| how do we tend to the fires, you know, the urgent needs developed over the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| while at the same time tending to the garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| which is the growth educationally and also the well-being of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| So during this season of education, we have a dual responsibility with these ESSER dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| and this opportunity with our priorities to first accelerate meeting the needs of our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| staff, and families, and second, use this fortunate opportunity to create sustainable strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| systems, and structures in place to make sure that our students are successful in grade level and post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1500)|
| 0:25:08| Okay. So I just want to touch base here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1508)|
| 0:25:10| and it should be noted that everything within our ESSER plan is built upon our student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| our stakeholder feedback, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| So a number of implementation considerations were highlighted during our stakeholder feedback on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1517)|
| 0:25:22| and the needs focused on A, frequent progress reports with data on impact and needed changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1522)|
| 0:25:28| B, equity across resources and programs, and C, ongoing stakeholder and community engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1528)|
| 0:25:37| Okay. Next, you're going to see our four what we call big bucket priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| which are one, foundational academic skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| and it should be noted within these priorities are our ESSER plan priorities that was approved as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1543)|
| 0:25:49| So within priority one, foundational academic skills, we have ESSER plan priority one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1549)|
| 0:25:55| Within priority two, effective educators, we have ESSER plan priority five and six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| Within our priority three, post-high school readiness, which is what we're going to highlight tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| we have priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1564)|
| 0:26:06| And within priority four, overcoming obstacles to learning, we have ESSER priority four and seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1566)|
| 0:26:15| And the next slide here I've created really shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| I want to create a graph here that shows you how our dollars are allocated across our priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| and it should be noted that priority one, which is foundational academic skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| and priority four are our bigger buckets because these will help us to overcome a lot of the obstacles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| that were impacted through COVID over the past two years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| And also that note that, you know, this KCS has used a stakeholder engagement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| to define the investment priorities for ESSER 3.0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| So as you look at that, you'll see very clearly that we've intentionally created the allocations here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| to make sure we're meeting the needs of our students due to, over the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| the circumstances, also priority four, which talks about the social well-being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and also facilities and structures as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| And I put this one together kind of like a fuel gauge here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| which talks about the percentages of the ESSER 3.0 allocation priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| As you can see here very clearly that, again, 26.3% is allocated towards priority one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1630)|
| 0:27:16| foundational academic skills, and also 27.2% is allocated towards overcoming obstacles to learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| not negating any of the other priorities, but this is based on our stakeholder feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| understanding that this is where we need to, like I said earlier, tend to those fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| while we're also nurturing our students as well moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1650)|
| 0:27:37| Okay, so we're going to dive into our implementation plan that we've created since being on board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| I've been a month on the job here, so we've been hit the ground running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| So we've created a cross-office coordination of all priority areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| and the why behind it is to make sure we have coherence and alignment without redundancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Also, we have created clear owners for each priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| and strategy that's underneath each of the priorities, which you'll see here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| And the why behind it is to make sure we have clear lines of responsibility and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1682)|
| 0:28:08| Next, we have a thorough but flexible implementation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| and the why behind it is to make sure we're forward-thinking and yet nimble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| and I always like to use the word of agility, you know, understanding that this is our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| but how can we monitor and adjust based on the needs that we have with our students and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| All right, we also have internal monitoring routines and supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| and the why behind it is to make sure we have responsive deployment of resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| and also regular reports to the board and community, sharing successes and telling our story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| And within telling our story, yes, we want to talk about our successes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| but also we want to be real and talk about any barriers or challenges that we may, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| encounter with doing this work because it is a short timeline of making sure that we have everything in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| by September 2024, so along the way each month we will be telling our story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| but also sharing any of the barriers that we may see coming up along the way as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1734)|
| 0:29:02| Okay, I'm sorry, there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| All right, now we're getting into our implementation plan flowchart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| So the following slide shows our implementation plan flowchart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| and how we've created accountability systems, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| for implementing and improving our narrow set of priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| So if we click through this, at the top we have our overarching implementation plan that we've created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| and within that plan we have priority one, foundation academic skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| priority two, effective educators, priority three, post-high school readiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| and lastly priority four, overcoming obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| And how we've developed each of our priorities is we have strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| anywhere between four to ten strategies per priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| and those strategies are underneath each of those priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| and the purpose of that is to guide the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| and make sure we're touching base with those strategies on a weekly basis, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| And then underneath each of the strategies we have specific action steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| anywhere between ten to twenty action steps each strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| For example, priority three we're sharing with tonight has 65 action steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| so there's a lot of action steps that we are monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| and diagnosing on a daily basis and on a weekly basis as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| And the overarching goal is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1807)|
| 0:30:09| It is to make sure that we have priority owners that are responsible for the priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| also we have strategy owners that are responsible for those strategies reporting out to us weekly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| and lastly we have action owners that make sure that the work is getting done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1818)|
| 0:30:22| kind of like a checklist to make sure we're hitting those marks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| So the overarching why is to make sure we have student success in grade level and post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1825)|
| 0:30:33| All right, so we're going to get into our measures of success flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1833)|
| 0:30:36| You know, we've worked really hard to create a continuous improvement cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| to measure our implementation success on a weekly basis, bi-weekly basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| and also monthly reporting out with specific strategies as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| So if you look at this, we want to make sure that each of our priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| are aligned to our current strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| so each of our priorities are aligned to our current strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| and also within that we want to make sure we have interim indicators of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| What that means is we want to make sure that we report out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| be it monthly or quarterly, our indicators of success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| how are we doing with each of the priorities, and be very transparent with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| what's working, what's not working, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| And how we're going to do that is each of our strategies have an implementation goal and an outcome goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| When you talk about implementation goal, you talk about what is the goal to get the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| The outcome goal is always driven by students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| How is this going to impact our students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Because this is the big why behind the work that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| And each strategy has a specific target and timeline and goal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| And also, lastly, making sure, again, that it pushes, what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| to the student's success in grade level and post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| And also these measures of success allow us as a team of priority owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| myself, the strategy owners, action team, to work together to answer questions of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| I've got two big questions of, A, are we doing what we say we're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| and B, is it working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Or if it's not working, how do we monitor and adjust that on a weekly basis as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1917)|
| 0:32:03| Okay, so this slide I want to share with you guys talks about how we are monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| and how these meetings are set up and how we've created that whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| If you look at the top there, there's a strategy, what we call a strategy calibration meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| and those are weekly meetings, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| where the priority owners meet with their strategy owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| and they talk about updates, norming of it, and on a one through four criteria that we've created as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| how are we doing with timelines, are there minor delays, major delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| what are the barriers or challenges to those delays, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| And then after that we move towards our biweekly priority calibration meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| which are led by myself and the priority owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| where we dig into what was brought forth from those strategy calibration meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| and we dig a little deeper with that work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| And then also from there we move into what we call our priority stock take meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| and that involves myself, the lead priority owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1973)|
| 0:32:57| as well as the Knox County Schools executive team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| where we share out our report that we're teeing up for it to present to the public and you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| and we talk about the successes, and also we have time for discussion and dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| around any barriers or challenges that we may see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| and how we can serve as a think tank, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| to make sure we're moving the needle in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| And then lastly, we report out every four months on each priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| to make sure we share that and be very transparent with the board and the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| So just to back up, each priority will kind of cycle through this whole process once every four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| So for today our priority is priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2012)|
| 0:33:38| Okay, so this is our board reporting schedule for the first four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| or what I call the first trimester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| Okay, so today we're going to talk about our post-high school readiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| with Dr. Keith Wilson and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Next month we're teeing up with our foundational academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| In April, effective educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| May, overcoming obstacles to learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| And then we're back in the cycle again with post-high school readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| So every four months you will hear a clear and concise report and updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| and it will get more robust with actual data as we move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| But understanding right now we're in the implementation phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| and phase one, if you will, of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2050)|
| 0:34:17| Okay, and the why behind it is we want to make sure we have those monthly reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| on implementing progress, like I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2060)|
| 0:34:22| and also make sure the priority owner co-presents with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2062)|
| 0:34:26| to give that depth, breadth, and continuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| And also we have what we created, a quantitative stoplight rating system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| which is green, orange, yellow, red, a scale of one to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| that we kind of rate each strategy and action step and priority on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| and give each priority an overall status that you will see here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| And also we have qualitative descriptions of the work as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| that we receive from our strategy owners and action owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| Okay, all right, so for the purpose of segmenting our reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| into trimester reporting per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| we're going to focus specifically today on priority three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| which is post-high school readiness for the month of February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| So now I'm going to hand it over to Dr. Keith Wilson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| who's our director of CTE programming, and he's our owner of priority three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| So we're going to kind of jump right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| As Dexter said, this month you get to hear from me about the priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| around post-high school readiness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| And some of you guys are familiar with this work already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| but haven't been involved with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| I'm here with strategy 3A and the academy high school model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| As Dexter mentioned, as we go through priority three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| and the different strategies that make that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| we want to keep in mind how it aligns back to the strategic goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2139)|
| 0:35:42| that we already have as a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| And so this particular strategy, when we think about post-high school readiness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| really fits nicely into our district strategic plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| where it talks about ready graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| When we think about ready graduate, there's multiple ways students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| can demonstrate their readiness for what comes after high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| and that's through different types of early post-secondary opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| ACT scores, all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2161)|
| 0:36:03| And then in addition, they obviously have to graduate, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2163)|
| 0:36:06| before they can be a ready graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| So when we think about those different metrics that fit into ready graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| and fit back into our district strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| hopefully you'll see those connections back to what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| with priority three here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| and the different pieces that we're working through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| So as I mentioned, for 3A, with the academy high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| we're looking to develop a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| We've been through a process, really, that began last spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| and has continued into this past fall semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| and now into this spring semester of working through the model for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| And so, again, where we are in terms of implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| we've obviously had several schools that have been on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| been part of the planning process with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| And as Dexter mentioned, we've got some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| that are going to be more implementation-related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| like building the structures and systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| that we're going to have to have in place to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| And then, obviously, we've got some data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| some metrics, outcomes that we'd like to see happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| And so for implementation, we've kind of set the ground around next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| for these seven schools that are participating in the lead cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| to establish their freshman academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2224)|
| 0:37:06| And in accordance with some minimum district requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| we've given them around how to group your teachers, location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| again, creating that small community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| that freshman family of teachers and educators for the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| building in a freshman seminar for those ninth-grade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| and ensuring that there's scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| small learning community time for those teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| where they're focusing in on the success of those kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| and the experiences they're building out for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| as well as PLC time where we think about content supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| and the types of things that our teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| are used to collaborating around in terms of content.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| And what do we hope to see with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| Well, we know, again, an important part of being a ready graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| is to be a graduate, and so we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| that our students are earning credits on the timeframe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2266)|
| 0:37:48| that we would expect them to see and staying on track to graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| And so we're going to be looking to see, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| are we seeing an impact on our freshmen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| and the number of credits earned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| And using this spring 2022 as a baseline to see, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| how many freshmen are exiting that freshman year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| with fewer than six credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| We're hoping to see that be an impacted number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| As Dexter mentioned already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| we kind of, as looking through these strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| we're going to provide ourselves with a qualitative ranking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| of red to green, and what that basically means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| is are we on track with our strategy, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| When we think about the steps that we've already begun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| and there will be some steps that we haven't begun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| obviously because we received this rather large grant in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| so we're really getting our feet underneath us right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| with some of this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| But with the steps within the action plan that we've started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| if we find that those are on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| then we've got some different levels that we attribute a ranking to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| So, for example, if 80% of your steps are on track that you started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2322)|
| 0:38:46| then that would be a green ranking, anything above 80%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| 60% for yellow, 40% for orange, and 20% for red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| You're going to see that the steps within priority three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| are all on green, which may be misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| I'll talk about that a little bit in terms of why that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| but that's kind of how we went through as strategy leads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| and ranked our different priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| So when we think about, again, this first strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| the Academy High School model, what's happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| We say we're green and we're on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2352)|
| 0:39:14| Well, we went through four master planning sessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| which began in October, ended in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| Those have been conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| We had an Academy 101 session that sort of was put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| and provided to our principals to present to their school staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| That I would consider to be on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| but we did hit a few hiccups in the road on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| because that was all scheduled for January 3rd and then school was out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| Then we had a week in January that school was out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| so we've had some challenges with the scheduling around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I'm actually going out and taking part in the ones at Central this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| that's been rescheduled a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| So we intended for that to happen by the end of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| but unfortunately, because of all the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2390)|
| 0:39:52| it has gotten pushed off a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2392)|
| 0:39:54| We're in the process of finalizing the portrait of a graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| which, again, if you've been part of that process with the Academy work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| you know that that was really where we began| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| in some of these large meetings with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| and with students and parents and teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| was really thinking through when we talk about graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| from our Knox County high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| what are those competencies, those skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| those things we expect them to be able to demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| that we know will be essential to their success post-graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| And so we spent some time really thinking through that and reshaping that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| and so that is still underway that we're finalizing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| because that will be an important sort of stake in the ground for the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| I think, moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| Key accomplishments is we've begun the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| for several of the professional development components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| being able to procure those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| for several of the professional development pieces that will be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| because, obviously, there's going to be different pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| that our staff and the school is going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| We're going to have training for leaders as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| and so we've begun the process of being able to secure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| so that we can begin that in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| We had 16 different teams of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| that participated in writing aspects of the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| and those final tactic plans, as they're called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| were due February the 4th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| so we now will be in the phase of taking those tactic plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| and putting them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| into more of a comprehensive finished final plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| that will help set out some procedures and expectations for schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| as they begin the work, really, next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| And then next steps, we've got 25 folks from Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2479)|
| 0:41:23| that will be making a visit to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| to participate in an on-site study visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| and look at some of the schools who have been implementing a model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| not necessarily the model we'll use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| but a model for career academies over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| We have some hiring to do for academy coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| which will be a crucial support position in this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| really serving in support of the principal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| in support of the school academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| serving as a liaison with those partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| that are going to be part of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| and that will happen, hopefully, through the hiring process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| getting them ready for summer because we'll have some training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| so we're shooting for May of 22 on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| And then we've already begun some conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| around setting the date and time for the final master plan to be published| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| and really to have our community designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2526)|
| 0:42:08| which is sort of a celebration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| that speaks back to the community who's been a part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| and says, you know, we've finished the work that we started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| in terms of writing this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| and that is when you officially become recognized as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| with the Ford Next Generation Learning Organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2541)|
| 0:42:27| The second strategy within our priority around post-graduation readiness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| ties back into work-based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| And so one of the things in the ESSER budget that we set out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2553)|
| 0:42:38| and kind of wrote some action around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| was being able to expand our work-based learning opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| but doing that by creating opportunities actually at the school site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| We know that it can be challenging for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| who maybe have limited transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| or honestly don't have a network where they already have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| to someone, an employer, who wants to give them a job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| which often is how we find work-based learning placements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| And so we wanted to start to think about what that might look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| to provide some of these more authentic experiences in the school site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| through practicum and through work-based learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| on the actual school location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| And so our strategy leads on this particular part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| are Chris Tucker and Gina Kirby that work in the CTE department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2596)|
| 0:43:19| Both are very familiar with work-based learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| And we have begun the process of having the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| to essentially promote some ideas with us, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Like, what would work in your school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| What would you see as being a need or a nice fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| with a program you already have for a work-based learning experience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2611)|
| 0:43:35| And have asked principals to submit some ideas to us, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| so we can just start to collect those ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| and have a discussion around what's feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| and start to prioritize and set some timelines for these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| But from an implementation standpoint, by spring of 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2626)|
| 0:43:50| we'd like to have an approved plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| for at least half of the high schools in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| And then by 2024, have 100% of our schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| with a completed plan for this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| The outcome goal, again, would be to increase the number of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| who are enrolled in a CTE work-based learning experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| and we feel like these experiences could give them that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| And we'll be looking to use the baseline number from the spring of 2023| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| to make those comparisons in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Again, they are on track as far as the process goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| They've begun the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2664)|
| 0:44:26| Principals have started to submit applications for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| We actually only have three that have submitted at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| in the last couple of weeks, so we're going to do some reach-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| and, again, make sure there's some traction around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| some additional support if maybe principals are a little unclear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| on what they're being asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| I've been out and had a couple of conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| at two other high schools that haven't submitted applications yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| and kind of cleared up some of their understanding on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| So, again, I think there's some work to be done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Also important is that Chris and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| have started having conversations already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| with our KCS maintenance and facilities folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| because when we think about these types of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2700)|
| 0:45:02| which could have implications for facilities changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| certainly with equipment and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| but we want to be able to make sure that we're planning this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| in sequence and with an understanding of the other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| in our ESSER grant that play into facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| and the workload that we have to take on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| So, certainly there could be some needed vendor agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| and other contractors that would have to be involved in this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| depending on what the projects end up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| And then the next step is going to be to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| once we have more of these plans, really to bring a team together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| to start to look at the feasibility of these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| look at the time that it's going to take to complete them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| alignment back to programming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| all those things need to be assessed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| as we start to think about where we want to start this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| and how fast we can get rolling on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2743)|
| 0:45:48| Next is middle school career exploration and awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| which is really just about becoming more consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| in the way we approach this work with our 5th through 8th graders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| As we know, if you get all the way to high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| before you've ever thought about careers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| that may be sort of a late start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| And there's, you know, a lot of guidelines and standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| and benchmarks set by the state already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| whether you look through the counseling standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| or you look at some of the milestones for career awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| that are out there and, again, published by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| We also have some state board policy requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| of how we communicate with students about their interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| their aptitudes, and how we link that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| to what they know about CTE programming at the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| So lots of things are out there that indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| we need to do a better job and need to be focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| on how we approach this work with our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| This is one of those that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| is because we got money in November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| we're looking at different vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| and different, you know, curricular resources, software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| things that are out there that might be of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| when we think about how to approach this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| across our schools and how it will be executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| And so, really, they're in the stage right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| of issuing RFPs, writing the paperwork that it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2816)|
| 0:47:01| in order to go out and secure these resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| so very early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| And then our goal will be once we kind of know those vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| and know the resources that are out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| to establish what we expect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| what are our grade-level outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| as we think about that experience from 5th to 8th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| and the resources that we may need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| for career awareness and exploration for these students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| Consider this one, again, to be on track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| and we talked about them going after the procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| That's kind of a first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| They have already begun to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| at the different career readiness resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2855)|
| 0:47:37| that are out there as an indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| for what types of things they need to procure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| and have talked to several external partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| including Ford, who has some communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| that are engaged in middle schools' work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| to look at their college and career readiness structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| Again, the next steps really are around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| convening some working committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| some steering committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| We think about middle schools and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| how this work fits back into the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| the schedules even around, like, related arts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| and things like that, the staff they have available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| in terms of who works there are very different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| and so we have to think about the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| in a variety of environments and who will own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| And so that's going to require some engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| with a variety of school counselors, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| and principals to think through that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| So there will be a considerable amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| of steering committee work that will have to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| to kind of get rid of that, and honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| a lot of planning in this first year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| will be what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Counseling and advisement is a big part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| of this work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| When we think about either career awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| or we think about the high school academies model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| obviously all of these are related back into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| And so we thought about a strategy here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| was to develop and implement a system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| for how we're creating and tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| personalized plans that students make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| that take them from secondary to post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| and really hook them into a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| and a pathway when they leave high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| And so our goal with this is to ensure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| first of all, let me back up a step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| we've got some additional staff positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| in the ESSER funds around a college and career counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| is how we're titling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| That may or may not, because that's in the works right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| may or may not end up being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| an actually licensed school counselor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| It could be more of like a coordinator position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| but that's how it's titled for the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| of the ESSER plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| so we'll keep that name for the time being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| But we've got it in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| to hire one of those for each of the middle schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| and the high schools to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2971)|
| 0:49:33| and help speak into this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| And so our goal is to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| that by the fall of 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| starting off next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| that we've got at least 90% of those positions filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| so that they can be in there and active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| helping us to accomplish some of the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| around this work with these post-secondary plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| And then as an outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2989)|
| 0:49:51| we want to ensure that at least 90%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| of our 8th to 12th grade students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| have completed a focus plan of study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2995)|
| 0:49:57| by next year, spring 2023,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| at the end of that school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=2999)|
| 0:50:01| Again, one that will provide them with some traction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| as they move from grade level to grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| Procurement is a piece here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| There's some counseling software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| that counselors actually already use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| but looking at continuing to utilize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| in the future called SCUDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| and it really helps them track their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| and show where are they spending their time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| in terms of the different responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| academic, social, emotional, college and career work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| And then also there was an action step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| within the original ESSER plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| to look at some outside consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| who can come in and really do a survey assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| and look for ways to strengthen the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| make suggestions about different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3041)|
| 0:50:43| that we could strengthen our outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| with our secondary counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| Key accomplishments is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| while we're thinking about the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| and high school career counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3053)|
| 0:50:55| college and career counselor roles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| that we're going to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| we also have identified the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| to have some additional support for that department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| So Jody Overton, who is the counseling specialist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| with Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| has actually been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| and drafted some job descriptions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| to give her some additional support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| And again, this will sort of be the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| in onboarding and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| these new counseling folks that we're looking to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Our next steps is going to be to finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| the college and career counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| or coordinator job description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| and again, establish that hiring process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| and we'll be looking to hire 16 middle school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3087)|
| 0:51:29| and 16 high school positions by May of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3089)|
| 0:51:35| And then the last strategy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| thank you guys for hanging in there with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3097)|
| 0:51:39| is the high school credit recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Again, as I said in the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| you got to graduate first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| if you're going to be a ready graduate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3104)|
| 0:51:45| So we want to have a multi-tiered system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| to help students that are behind in credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| to earn those and get those back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| and really meet that target of an on-time graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| And our first goal is to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| our participation rate for credit recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| for eligible students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| So when we think about eligible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| if you don't pass a class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| but you make 50% or better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| you mastered half of what you needed to master,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| there's an opportunity in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| for you to go back through these credit recovery efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| and to recapture, if you will, that credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| If you're below a 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| it's usually an indication that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| you probably need to think about repeating that class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| So we have a category of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| who maybe haven't been successful in their first run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| who could earn that credit back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| and so that's the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3149)|
| 0:52:30| that we're talking about targeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| that above 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| And then our outcome goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3153)|
| 0:52:34| and we talk about cohort-centered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| we're talking about at a grade level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| tracking that grade level over time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| A cohort-centered decrease in the percent of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3160)|
| 0:52:42| who are failing to meet that level of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| we know they need to stay on time as graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| And what that means is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| they're exiting the freshman year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| entering the sophomore year with six or fewer credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| 13 exiting the sophomore into the junior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| 20 exiting the junior into the senior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| So we're gonna be looking at those numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| and we're hoping to see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| that number of students decrease over time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| If we have so many exiting their freshman year off track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| we wanna see that number drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| by the end of their sophomore year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| drop again by the end of their junior year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| in tracking that cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| And so again, capturing some data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| at the end of this spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| will give us a baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| for the number that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| for our freshman, sophomore, juniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| and then we'll be able to use that as an indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| as we look at future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| And implementation updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| actually still going on currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| We've reinstated the not-alternative program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| which is something we haven't had over the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| giving students, again, another opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| to reengage, to earn some of those credits back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| We actually have a couple of high schools also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| that are piloting a not-alternative program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| within their own building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| in addition to the ones that we run at the district level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| And then we've had a January blitz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| is what we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| but a credit recovery effort that began,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| and again, I already mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| sort of the weird schedule we had with January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| So the January blitz became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| the January and February blitz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| is running through February the 11th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| but we're still engaged in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| and have already started to, key accomplishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| have already started to see some feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| from the schools about students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| that have engaged in that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| and are earning credits back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| and that's a real positive direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| that we're seeing for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Got about two weeks, well, a little bit less now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| to complete the blitz,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| and then once that timeframe is over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| with those efforts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3268)|
| 0:54:30| we'll be collecting data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| and be able to share that by the end of February| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| to kind of see what number of credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| were earned back by students who were deficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| And I think I'm turning this back to Dexter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| unless you all have any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3287)|
| 0:54:48| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3288)|
| 0:54:49| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3289)|
| 0:54:50| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| So thank you for going through all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3292)|
| 0:54:54| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| Okay, the coach, the career counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3295)|
| 0:55:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3300)|
| 0:55:01| Are those different positions than the academy coaches?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| So the academy coaches really are a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| within Ford and that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| that is sort of defined as a liaison, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| They will really work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| when you think about establishing those partnerships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| and continuing to sort of sustain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3318)|
| 0:55:19| and engage with those partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| that'll support the academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3321)|
| 0:55:22| That'll be a big part of their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| is to take that load off of the administration at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| On the school side, the school-facing side of that role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3327)|
| 0:55:30| they'll be working with teachers more in those SLC times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3330)|
| 0:55:33| as they think about, you know, different experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| and projects and things that will be planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| within the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| They support really in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| So that's very much pointed at the academy structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| And so like roughly how many do you envision per high school?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| So when you look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| that one academy coach is a support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| for all the academies in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3353)|
| 0:55:56| And again, getting to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| and really connect with the partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| that support the different academies in the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| So I guess my big question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3362)|
| 0:56:08| I know that ESSER funding would fund these positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| and also the career and college counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| but what about when ESSER is finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| It seems like a lot of staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| So what about the fiscal note on that past 2024?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| I guess is my big concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3385)|
| 0:56:28| Because I know when we talked about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| when we talked about kind of the additional positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| for ESSER in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| my kind of general understanding was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| we were going to try some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| for instance, the tutors, that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| to see if it worked and if it moved the needle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| then we would try to figure out some funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| but this obviously is not the same case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3409)|
| 0:56:50| So does anybody want to speak to that, Dr. Isaac?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| I'll be happy to take the hard questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Thank you, Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| So that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| So I think a lot of these things were put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| for kind of proof of concept, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| to make sure there are things that we feel we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3422)|
| 0:57:06| And working with Ford, I mean, as Keith explained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| I mean, that's a pretty critical role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| to really have someone who can speak business and education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| who's kind of working through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| all those work-based learning experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| and engaging the partners and making sure they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| So I think a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| we could think about moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3441)|
| 0:57:22| So one could be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| I know we won't open that can of worms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| about how the state funding is going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| but, I mean, there could be things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| that could radically change staffing formulas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| in future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3451)|
| 0:57:32| And so I think we would be smart to be thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| with that foresight ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| that these would be things we would potentially pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| in a staffing formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| so that it's not an either-or kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Other parts on, like, college and career counseling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I think we're talking to some community partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| I think there's people who are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| in thinking about that who may be in that space now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| This could make sense, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3472)|
| 0:57:54| in some of the things they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3474)|
| 0:57:56| I mean, I know there's a lot of nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| that are interested in doing different kinds of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| toward that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| And so we would probably look for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| some of those partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| I've had a few conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| but not ones I can really talk about publicly right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| that we might be able to look at that and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| is that now a piece of their work moving in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3491)|
| 0:58:13| We've kind of proven concept, and we hand off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| That would be the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| But, no, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I mean, there are additional positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| Ms. Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3502)|
| 0:58:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Mine's kind of along the lines with Susan's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| So the goal is 90% fill rate of college and career counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3506)|
| 0:58:33| I want to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| So that's 16 and 16 for a total of 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| New positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| What about the people that are already serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| as college and career counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| kind of in our high schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| Do they apply for these positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3529)|
| 0:58:52| Is this in addition to their position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| Because from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| we already had those positions in some of our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| It may look different, what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| But how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Yeah, and I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| I think that's still some of what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3545)|
| 0:59:07| in my conversations with Jody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| some of what I think has to be figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| In addition to that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| we've got schools that have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| pipeline as a service that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| and provides additional college and career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Certainly there are people with Project Grad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| that provide some of those services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| and different service providers that play, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| in this same sort of house, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3563)|
| 0:59:25| So I think the way currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| and when I think about college and career counselor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| being named as, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| a person on the staff of the high schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| I think that's about three or four of our high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| that have someone that's actually named in that title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| I think that's part of, and let me say too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| sometimes that's a counselor, sometimes it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| So we really have that title being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| across some different positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| different pay scales, different licenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| that the people that are in those roles hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| And I think that's why, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| getting sort of the job description sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| in terms of what we were talking about this person doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| and really thinking about it from nine to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| When you think about college and career counseling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| again, I'm speaking just from my experience in being out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3604)|
| 1:00:07| the college and career counseling work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| that we see a lot of in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| when there is a named counselor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| really ties back into like FAFSA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| It ties back into that junior year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| and ties back into really that, you know, college planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| that kind of end of the upper class work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| And this would be one that would be about really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| thinking about those transition plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| We talked about building those from eighth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| all the way through the 12th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| I think you've got to have somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| who sort of comes in and holds the keys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| as we're all doing this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| to make sure that each student, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| again, we have that system for developing these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| for knowing they exist, for tracking where we are on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| And quite honestly, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| counselors are busy folks and there's a lot of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| that they are already responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| And so it's about putting some more hands to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| I think, the systematic way that we are looking at students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| at each grade level with this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| Thank you for answering that in depth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| and that gives me a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| of what you're looking towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| So thanks, Keith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| Ms. Bann.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| Yeah, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| As I was thinking about the Ford Next Generation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| kind of schools that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| and you were talking about the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| is trying to do those freshman academies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Do we have any plan to have conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| with the eighth graders and with the eighth grade parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| Because a lot of them have had older kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| and what they've expected for high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| is going to be different for this new class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| and I just didn't know how we were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| at that kind of transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| We actually have talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| and even within my own department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| because of a change in the law, technically, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| In the past, it's always been expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| that students in the seventh or eighth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| were provided with an aptitude assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| and then it was suggested that you give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| some information about high school programming afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Well, that law changed, actually, this past year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| to say that you now are required to give them that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| And so we've been working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| some of those promotional materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| really to try to be ready for the spring to do some of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| but now, too, thinking about the forward work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| as a layer of that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| So really thinking about materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3722)|
| 1:02:03| and stuff that we can put out that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3723)|
| 1:02:04| We've talked about that a little bit in our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We have a weekly call where we kind of look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| We've talked about that as well with the promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| But, no, it is on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| It's on the minds of those that are doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3733)|
| 1:02:16| but we haven't, like, firmed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| exactly what that looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| But, you know, there's lots of eighth grade parent nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| and things like that that are opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3740)|
| 1:02:21| for that type of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| For sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| And it certainly does make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| I mean, the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3751)|
| 1:02:32| You know, what they will experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| and kind of course offerings and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3754)|
| 1:02:36| for the freshman academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| is a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| than probably what the normal transition to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| or historical transition would be to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| Mr. Chin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| So I guess, really, to start this off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| just generally I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3769)|
| 1:02:51| that having talked to some students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| there is confusion around this academy structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| and the Forward NGO plan and everything around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| and there's some frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3778)|
| 1:02:59| about a lack of kind of transparency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| about what exactly is going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| and how that would impact future students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| So I know, first off, that in the Forward NGO program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| it was stated that students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| would be a very important aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Could you tell me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3793)|
| 1:03:14| through these master planning sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3794)|
| 1:03:15| and things related to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| what kind of student input has there been?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| So I took you all the way back to last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| Part of the first phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| which is the explore phase of the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3805)|
| 1:03:27| is to conduct a large number of focus groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3807)|
| 1:03:30| which unfortunately had to be virtual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3810)|
| 1:03:31| because of COVID last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3811)|
| 1:03:33| but focus groups that were conducted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| with each of the Knox County high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| That included a student group from each high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| It included a teacher group from each high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| It included a parent group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| from 12 of the 15 high schools that were involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| In addition to the school's representatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| we had a variety of community representatives as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| through post-secondary groups, business groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| different convenings of different focus groups they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3834)|
| 1:03:57| A total of about 49 of those that were done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| And so certainly there was an opportunity last spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| for a selection of students from each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| to have a conversation through that focus group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| about really what their experience currently was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| in high school, how that might look different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| what they liked about their high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| what they'd like to see more of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3854)|
| 1:04:15| what they'd like to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3855)|
| 1:04:16| that maybe they weren't experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| So that's really how the process began last spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| When we moved from the explore phase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| into planning this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3863)|
| 1:04:24| which is sort of the vision casting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| the student group we had for our October meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| which was our first kind of vision casting meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| was a little larger, quite honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| I think we had about two to three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| from each high school that was involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| and that was seven high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| We were in that 15 to 20 range, I think, exactly, for that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3879)|
| 1:04:43| And they were very much involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| in our initial conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| around sort of drafting a why statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| Why does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Why do we want to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| redesigning the high school model?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| What could be the benefit of going in this direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| And then also, as I mentioned already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| that portrait of a graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| which is, again, sort of painting a picture for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| no matter which school or community you attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| we would expect that a graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| coming out of Farragut High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| would have the same exposures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| build the same skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3910)|
| 1:05:11| have the same experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3911)|
| 1:05:12| to prepare them for post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| as a student coming out of Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| Like, it should be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| And so the portrait of a graduate really is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| was about Knox County Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| along with that variety of post-secondary partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| parents, students, teachers in the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| being able to have a conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| what do we want for our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| and for those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| And so that was a big one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| in the first couple of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| kind of getting that finalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| But we had a student group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| that participated from the seven schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Again, a couple, a student or two from each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| We had about 150 in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| as far as the whole group size went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| So that was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| we couldn't have, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| a class full of kids from each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| But we did have them in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| talking about things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| our student ambassador piece to this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| how student leadership will look through this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| different student experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3959)|
| 1:06:01| And so they were able to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| and weigh in on those aspects of the work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| And also, if you know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| and you might not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| but could you possibly provide insight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| as to how these students were chosen or selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| or invited to these programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3976)|
| 1:06:17| So we actually left that up to our school principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| We asked them to help identify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| I do know that some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| that participated in the conversation with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| during the live meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| actually had gotten a chance to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| in some of the focus groups the year before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| So they were at least familiar with, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3990)|
| 1:06:31| the startup of that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| and that sort of piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3993)|
| 1:06:34| But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| they were definitely selected at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| And kind of moving more into the academy structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3998)|
| 1:06:39| because I want to just make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| that students understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| what this academy will look like in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4004)|
| 1:06:45| First, looking at those freshman seminars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| could you talk about a little bit more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| of what those classes will look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| So the freshman seminar is a single class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| It's designed to be either, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| a traditional block class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| that would be a semester long, one credit class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| or a 45-minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| could be fit into a skinny over the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4019)|
| 1:07:02| If I had to sort of break down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| kind of how that class flows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| the first part of it really is around some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| you know, soft skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| I would call them employability or success skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| really things that will help you be successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| when you think about your high school experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| moving from middle school into high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| things like time management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4037)|
| 1:07:18| skills like being, you know, collaborative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| working on a team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| those sorts of things will be aspects of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| you know, pieces you would learn about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| employability skills, soft skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| You transition from that first part of the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| into a time where you're able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| some types of tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| like we use U Science in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| to take some exams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| not exams, tests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| to learn a little bit about your own interests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4059)|
| 1:07:41| interest inventories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| your aptitudes, where do you show strengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| and there's some reporting on the backside of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| that really takes that and ties it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| different career paths and tracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| and you can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| okay, these would be good fits for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| these may be not so good fits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| but it gives you a starting place to explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| And then from that midpoint in the class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| where you've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| you start to promote and market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| your pathways that would come out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| So when you think about, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4083)|
| 1:08:04| a Farragut high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| as they identify the themes for their academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| the pathways, the elective pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| that make up those themes within,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| that would be the time that those freshman students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4092)|
| 1:08:15| would have, again, this information about me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4095)|
| 1:08:18| and start to think about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| okay, the next three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4099)|
| 1:08:20| I have the opportunity to dive a little deeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| into one of these pathways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| which one feels like it would be the best fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| And so really coming out of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4106)|
| 1:08:27| freshman seminar experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| the students have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| to make a decision about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| what they think the pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| that would be the best fit for them would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| Kind of moving on through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| 10 through 12 academies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| I understand that, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| all of this is still in planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| and there's not been anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| that's technically been finalized yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| but could you also give a description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| of what those will look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| Will you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Basically, just could you provide more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| as to what the 10 through 12 academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| might look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| The 10 through 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| So, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| and we've sort of communicated this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| with our principals as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4141)|
| 1:09:02| your academies will be largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| probably career-themed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| when you think about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| but even within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| as you think about the pathways within that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| that doesn't mean every pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| would necessarily be a CTE pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| So Farragut's a great example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4154)|
| 1:09:15| when you think about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| You're familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| so I'm talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4157)|
| 1:09:18| So when you think about Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| they have currently a STEM program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| which is a CTE program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4161)|
| 1:09:22| engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4162)|
| 1:09:23| I know also that there's lots of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4163)|
| 1:09:25| that take upper-level AP tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4165)|
| 1:09:27| when they think about their elective focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| So you could take something like a STEM CTE program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| that students are following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| and pair that in with a different pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| that might be just AP science-focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| or AP math-focused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| or you could plug in an IT pathway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| like a coding pathway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| into something that would all fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4183)|
| 1:09:44| under an umbrella of STEM, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| While some would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| a very engineering-focused CTE path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| others would be much broader and more open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4191)|
| 1:09:53| but no matter which of those pathways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| within that academy you would be a part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| you would still have that theme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4197)|
| 1:09:58| that would bring in partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| from different science realms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| different fields,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| different career tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| that could speak to the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| could provide experiences for the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| who are learning advanced science,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| who are learning engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4210)|
| 1:10:11| who are learning coding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4211)|
| 1:10:12| to have application and connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| to career tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| that would allow them to take something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| maybe that they're good at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4217)|
| 1:10:18| and continue to explore it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| to find those post-secondary connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| and programs that would help support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| if they wanted to continue down that track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Again, you could take something like an arts focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| and plug it in with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| like a digital arts program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4231)|
| 1:10:32| So you take something that's very computer-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| and move it in with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| that's maybe more performing arts-based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| So it's really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| the idea really is that the theme itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| provides that opportunity for a deeper experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| for a connection to the career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| It doesn't mean that every pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4245)|
| 1:10:47| that makes up that academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4247)|
| 1:10:48| wouldn't necessarily have to be the CTE pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| And then in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4251)|
| 1:10:53| there's always going to be electives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| global electives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| that are available in the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| to every student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| So when you think about the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| you would spend in your academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| from a 10th to 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| it's probably 50% of your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| would be spent with that group of teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| that smaller learning community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| But you may have to go off your academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| to take a foreign language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| or to take an AP offering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| that's maybe outside of your academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| But those are still planned for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| and built into the experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| for students to be able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| I guess another question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| with regards to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| I'm sorry for all the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| You're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4285)|
| 1:11:26| students are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| from what I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| frustrated about not hearing about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| because I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| things have been moving really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| I understand that the freshman seminar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| class will be implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| the next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| So I know students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| want to have that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| to know what exactly is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| So on that note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| what plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4302)|
| 1:11:43| do you all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4303)|
| 1:11:44| for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4305)|
| 1:11:46| ensuring that students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4306)|
| 1:11:47| and other members of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4307)|
| 1:11:48| have an idea of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| any future changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4310)|
| 1:11:51| that are coming to this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| any new plans or updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4316)|
| 1:11:57| I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4317)|
| 1:11:58| I'm not super surprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| that there's not a ton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| of information out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| because I've already noted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| we've been going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| a pretty robust process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| for four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4325)|
| 1:12:06| of writing the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4326)|
| 1:12:07| that will actually conduct this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4327)|
| 1:12:08| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| So we're able to put enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| stakes in the ground to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| freshman academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| is this tangible first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4333)|
| 1:12:14| Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| we can define this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4335)|
| 1:12:16| We know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| But there's still a lot of decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| that have to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4338)|
| 1:12:19| and really have to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| at the school level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4340)|
| 1:12:21| about best fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4341)|
| 1:12:22| about our students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4342)|
| 1:12:23| about our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| And there will have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| extra input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| additional input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| As we start thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| about selecting themes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4348)|
| 1:12:29| and the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| that are going to matter most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| to each community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| there's going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| to be a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| for the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4354)|
| 1:12:35| to do some additional collecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| And even if that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| we're thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4359)|
| 1:12:40| here's five different ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4360)|
| 1:12:41| we could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| What are your all's thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| Like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| this is how we could pair up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| and group up things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| There's going to have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| that part of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| nailed down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| on what those things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| we'll have to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| to give some of that input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4374)|
| 1:12:55| But quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4375)|
| 1:12:56| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4376)|
| 1:12:57| we're in the phase right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| of trying to finalize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| 16 different pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| of that master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| And moving at a pretty quick pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| But I think for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| you look right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4386)|
| 1:13:07| for the 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| through the 12th grader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| for the freshman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| moving into 10th grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4391)|
| 1:13:12| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4392)|
| 1:13:13| this is a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| that's going to sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| build over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| for that freshman academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| we're going to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| in a window next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| to make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| and then that freshman group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| after 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| will move up into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| sort of that first cohort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| in an actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| pathway academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| And we'll see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4409)|
| 1:13:30| over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| sort of build out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| The experience for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| who are already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| in the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| it may not reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| all of the academy build out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4417)|
| 1:13:38| quite the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| for a student| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4420)|
| 1:13:41| who's starting next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4421)|
| 1:13:42| and going to follow that cohort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4422)|
| 1:13:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4423)|
| 1:13:44| And then also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4424)|
| 1:13:45| you mentioned the student input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| and how they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| really help shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| what these academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| will look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4430)|
| 1:13:51| How do you foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| that input being used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4432)|
| 1:13:53| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| how impactful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4434)|
| 1:13:55| would that input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| for these programs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| I think I'll have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| to each of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4442)|
| 1:14:03| because as you think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| the programs that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| and the things that we offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| currently in the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| that does come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| to things like staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| It comes back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| licensures and endorsements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4450)|
| 1:14:11| and the people that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| We're very fortunate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| that the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| of our programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| at least are justifiable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| when we start to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4456)|
| 1:14:17| like labor market demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| and where students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| can follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| a post-secondary track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| out of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| But certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| there's places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| we could tighten up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| and over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| we'll want to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| at opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| that maybe we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| capitalizing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| So student input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| will be important to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Student interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| will be very important to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| But there's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| other factors like those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| like teacher endorsements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| and workforce demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4477)|
| 1:14:38| and all those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| that we have to maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| sort of a balance with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4480)|
| 1:14:41| So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4481)|
| 1:14:42| we want principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| to be thoughtful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| about the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| they want to package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4485)|
| 1:14:46| this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| and we're expecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| our role to support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| and give them the tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| to sort of think through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| what the best themes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4491)|
| 1:14:52| will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| based on that input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| based on what they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| in terms of their staff already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| Just one final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Raymond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| if we could get some more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| board members engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| we can come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Or just one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| I'm sorry again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| I'm sorry that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| so many questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| Just one final question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| that I had some students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| like ask me specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| So as we're rolling through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| in future years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| should it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| should it be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| students are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| benefiting from this program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| that this program is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4520)|
| 1:15:21| who knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| I'm not saying it will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| but for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| if it is detrimental,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4524)|

| 1:15:28| Is there a possible way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| to stop this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Well, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I don't think we've gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| with the action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| of where do we come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| and kill it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| I'd say going into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| that certainly we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| for certain impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4540)|
| 1:15:41| on things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| graduation rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| We're looking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| that are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| have a negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4546)|
| 1:15:47| impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| We're looking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| which again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| we don't have a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4551)|
| 1:15:52| in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4552)|
| 1:15:53| It's very fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4553)|
| 1:15:54| We're definitely looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| at students being able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| to access different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| opportunities that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| hadn't been out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| for them before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| We definitely want to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| better at looking at data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| around things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| post-secondary persistence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| I think we do a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| good job in our district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| of helping students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| access post-secondary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| but we also know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| that some of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| and a large portion of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| sometimes don't stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| in their post-secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| enrollment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| so I think there's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| I think a lot of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| are successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| or graduate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| but are successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4579)|
| 1:16:20| two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| six years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| and getting better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4583)|
| 1:16:24| at sort of tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| some of those pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4585)|
| 1:16:26| right now that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4586)|
| 1:16:27| honestly is difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| We know some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| are not where they need to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4589)|
| 1:16:30| but we've got additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4590)|
| 1:16:31| work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| in regard to making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| as they move out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| they're not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4595)|
| 1:16:36| going to college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| or going to a trade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| or going to the workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| but they're doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| in the most informed way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4600)|
| 1:16:41| possible in making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4601)|
| 1:16:42| those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4602)|
| 1:16:43| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Board Member Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| Mr. Jen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| I would just like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| I've heard from concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4608)|
| 1:16:49| from Fairgate High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4609)|
| 1:16:50| students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4610)|
| 1:16:51| and so I've met extensively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| I've talked several times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| with Dr. Bartlett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4613)|
| 1:16:54| and so just a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| that will hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| set your mind at ease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| I think that Mr. Wilson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| answered very correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| why students haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| heard a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| it's because this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| in process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| and there's just not much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| to report out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Students that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4625)|
| 1:17:06| in the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4626)|
| 1:17:07| as he said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| it probably won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| really be a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| but I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| it probably won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| really affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| So, I know Dr. Bartlett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| is planning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| talk with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| eighth grade parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| when he has meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| back to Ms. Babs' question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| he's planning to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4642)|
| 1:17:23| this with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| the freshmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| the rising freshmen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| because it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| impact them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| So, things that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| sacred at Fairgate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4649)|
| 1:17:30| are not going to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| so there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| all of the AP opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4652)|
| 1:17:33| that are always there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4653)|
| 1:17:34| and so those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| that make each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4655)|
| 1:17:36| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4656)|
| 1:17:37| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4657)|
| 1:17:38| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4658)|
| 1:17:39| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| as a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| our schools are still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| going to be individual schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| I think you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| that the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| are determining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4669)|
| 1:17:50| currently what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| their academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| so they will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4673)|
| 1:17:54| be all the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| All of the academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| will vary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4677)|
| 1:17:58| from school to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| based on the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| of those particular schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| So, I would just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| for a little bit of patience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| because they're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4685)|
| 1:18:06| through all of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| and it's very time consuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| This is a major shift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| And so it is time-consuming and change is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| But I've asked all these questions and so I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4694)|
| 1:18:18| that they're working through those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4698)|
| 1:18:19| And so I, you know, I hope that reassures you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| that there's really, there have been students involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| and there have been teachers involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| in community stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| And so it's just, it's a long process though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| But I think that those things that are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| at Farragut will continue to be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| and that this will really just assist and help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| with what's already going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4726)|
| 1:18:47| If I could just add, like I don't want, to your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| this is not a model that takes anything away from a student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| It really is about enriching the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| that the students have and brings a level of structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4735)|
| 1:18:59| to a school where all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| around work-based learning, around connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| with industry partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| with community folks having a connection point back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| into the school, all the things that we try to do in lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| of different ways, this really gives a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| and an operation and a system to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| And so again, you know, it's not an initiative to your question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| of if it doesn't work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| It's not an initiative that we say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| we're going to put this in place and three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4761)|
| 1:19:23| from now our Algebra 2 scores are going to shoot up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| It's not that kind of a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| It really is about ensuring that as students leave us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| they do that as educated and as informed and as self-aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| as they can to make that next best decision for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| Yeah, I would just like to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| I had the opportunity two years ago to go over and witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| and we're not going to do the cookie cutter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| of what National's doing, but see an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| of what it's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| And the thing that I came away from that I was so excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| about was the industry partners that National had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| We talk all the time in Knox County schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| about partnerships and I would say I'd give us a big F for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| We just don't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| We don't have a structure for doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4807)|
| 1:20:09| and I think what this does is this is a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| and it's going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4812)|
| 1:20:13| It's not going to happen overnight, but it's a model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| to get our industry partners involved and we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| about career technical all the time and we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| about career technical and this is a way to really get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| into schools and it is change and change is painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| Nobody, everybody likes exactly the way it is, but guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| We can't do it differently without doing change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| And the one thing like I would even give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| as a personal example, I had a daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4837)|
| 1:20:39| that was very good at science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| She did science, so she thought she should be a doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| and she had an opportunity because I knew about it to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| I knew how to get her to apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4847)|
| 1:20:49| to a program over at UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| It was a fabulous program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| She loved it, but she came out of that and was like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4853)|
| 1:20:56| I do not want to be a doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| And what I saw about that was she did not waste four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| of pre-med applying to med school to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| out she did not like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4865)|
| 1:21:06| And that's what I too want to talk to parents about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| Your school might not have a pathway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| of exactly what your kid thinks they might be interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| but they might learn something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| that maybe would even pique their interest in another way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| or it might be like my child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| You get the opportunity of learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4880)|
| 1:21:23| That's not what I should go into studying and I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| as much of an education and I think also some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| of these opportunities shouldn't be about me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| as the parent having a connection that got my daughter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| to go do something at UT Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| We want all of our kids to have those opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| and right now that's not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| in Knox County Schools, we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| So I do, I just applaud what we're doing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| It is going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| We've got to have some patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Even, I'm sure even with the freshman academies next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| we will learn a lot after we put them in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| about what's working and what's not and we adjust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| But I do, I do, I'm very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| I think this is something that is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| to be really beneficial to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| but it is going to take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| And I think it's not a kill, it's a do we learn as we go along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| and you know we morph things or we make changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| But I think it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| I've been excited to be part of all of the community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| and I think there are quite a few board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| that have been able to go and I think we've been able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| to see what's going on and I think I'm looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4943)|
| 1:22:26| to what's going forward, but I do appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| I think you're bringing up valid questions that I think a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| of people, you're at the school and they're afraid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| but what's funny is I think the people you're actually hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| from will never even experience it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| So I do think it's even the people that are experiencing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| that they will not know about school any different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4961)|
| 1:22:44| and I'm just going to say I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Thank you Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4969)|
| 1:22:50| I'm also excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| I know many of us have gotten to volunteer and engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| through the planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| You mentioned the 16 tactical plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| One of those tactical plans is community and family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| or communication and family engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| That plan was just due February 4th, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| So even the way in which we communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4986)|
| 1:23:09| about this is still being planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| So it's not surprising that there's a lot of unknowns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| that are out there, but I want to encourage people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| to be patient, stay engaged with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| One of the things I kept hearing over and over is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| that this is not a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| It is a process that we've been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| If we were buying a program off a shelf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| we could tell everybody exactly how it was going to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| but we're going through a process to build a plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5008)|
| 1:23:32| So I'm looking forward to it and I think there's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| to be a lot of value added to Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| And I only have one question and that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| and one statement actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Dr. Murphy, I really appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| You've given me a lot of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| in this ESSER monitoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| You are the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| So I appreciate the structure that you're bringing to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| But the only question I have is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| out of the different priority and goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| and the strategy owners, how many total owners do you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5035)|
| 1:23:59| we have in this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5039)|
| 1:24:00| We have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| Unduplicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5042)|
| 1:24:03| We have four priority owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5043)|
| 1:24:04| We have strategy owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| I would say, without pulling up the numbers right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| Yeah, just rough numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| Anywhere between 20 strategy owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| and then we have action owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| and that gets pretty lengthy as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| So we have a whole team downtown that's working hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| I appreciate you bringing that level of detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5060)|
| 1:24:23| and structure to the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5063)|
| 1:24:26| Yeah, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5066)|
| 1:24:27| I mean, because I believe that we have to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5067)|
| 1:24:28| at that granular level to make sure that we're meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| We meet weekly with the strategy owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| Even before that, they meet with their action teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| to make sure we're hitting deadlines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5075)|
| 1:24:37| and timelines with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Because it is important work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| It's expedient work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5079)|
| 1:24:40| But it's critical work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| And I just want to touch base real quick on this one slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| and I can have you guys weigh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| Regarding priority three, thank you so much, Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| Priority three is on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5089)|
| 1:24:50| 100% of the strategies are on track currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| I will say that with a caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Like he said, we may come back in four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| because we're starting to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| that it may be bumped down to minor delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5098)|
| 1:25:01| because things may have gotten in the way of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| But just right now, we're moving in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| Action steps completed, 5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| Action steps on track, 75%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Action steps and minor delay based to a few minor things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| with one or two actions, 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| And 17% have not been started yet based on timelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| which is what we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5119)|
| 1:25:20| Some of the work, like the forward work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5120)|
| 1:25:21| things of that nature as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5121)|
| 1:25:23| But I did want to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| This came up in our priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| This has been like our big three themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I ask our priority team weekly when we meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| you know, what are some barriers and challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| that we foresee in horizon planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| that we can see down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5134)|
| 1:25:35| Like risk mitigation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5135)|
| 1:25:36| And so managing change in a critical timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| and you guys spoke very well, Ms. Virginia, to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5139)|
| 1:25:41| talking about it's going to take time for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| I mean, but how can we get in front of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5143)|
| 1:25:45| to make sure that we've got the right people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| speaking the right language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| that we're all on the same team, moving that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| that we have our principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| we've communicated with them about things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| and they're sharing that with their communities as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| And also planning ahead with procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| So what we're doing right now is looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5157)|
| 1:25:59| our hot items for procurement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| and we're kind of backwards looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| what needs to be happening right now with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| and also staffing challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| I mean, we have staffing challenges right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| without this work, so how do we foresee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| making sure that we're moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| with staffing challenges as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5173)|
| 1:26:14| So these are things that, you know, we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| we're trying to be proactive with on our end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| So overall, we're looking good, we're looking great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| We have a great plan in place with implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| so we're just glad to share this out with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| and thank you so much for your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5188)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| I'll make this super fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5190)|
| 1:26:31| and if we could have a really quick answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| because we have a lot more to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| but I just want to make this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5194)|
| 1:26:35| I've talked to Dr. Ryswick about this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| because I've heard from some community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| who are concerned that Ford is trying to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| what we were doing or something to that effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| and that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| This is, Dr. Ryswick, please correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5208)|
| 1:26:51| but we are asking Ford to help us walk through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| putting a plan together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| This is our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| They're not telling us what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| I didn't get to go to very many of the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| but the ones that I went to, over and over again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| I heard them say, you tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| This is not our plan, you tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| Is that an accurate statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Is there anything you'd like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| I just want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5232)|
| 1:27:12| that people understand that issue clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| No, thank you, Ms. Horn, and I think that's 100% accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| I mean, they've gotten a formula together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| where they've done this in 50-plus communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| across the United States and the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| and really, it is to a lot of things I've heard today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| How do you build a framework for industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| to engage in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| and how do we get students ready for those kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| and I think that they've shared that across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| So we went looking for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| and looking for someone who could help us partner with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| because I think, as Ms. Babb said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| we've struggled locally to get that kind of traction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| and so we sought them out, but no, they're very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| I mean, I think, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| that worked a lot with these guys in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| Almost at times, it's frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| We almost wish they would tell us kind of the next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5277)|
| 1:28:00| as we go through it, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| And they're very much like, no, it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| that you take the process, get the input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| what it means for you in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| and so they have been great partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| but no, I agree 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5289)|
| 1:28:10| Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| Thank you, Dr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| Dr. Wilson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| Yeah, thank you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| Next up next month is priority one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| foundational academic skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| Awesome, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| And board members, we have had several requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| a short break right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| so if we want to take a very brief 10 minute break,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5310)|
| 1:28:40| Dr. Risely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5320)|
| 1:28:43| Yeah, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5323)|
| 1:28:44| All the listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Where is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5325)|
| 1:28:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| And I'm just gonna do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| Regretting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5334)|
| 1:29:00| Well, maybe it's not worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| Oh!| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5343)|
| 1:29:12| Revenge in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5352)|
| 1:29:17| Okay, so we will continue with a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5357)|
| 1:29:20| from Ms. Satterfield on the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| So we, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| So we met, the committee met earlier this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| for the superintendent committee search chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5375)|
| 1:29:37| So we'll give you an update on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| and just kind of discuss our next steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| and where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| So just the overview itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| we had to come up with the actual interview date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| and the schedule itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| and how we will conduct the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| So I'll give you background around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| I'll let Betsy speak about the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Board member Henderson will speak about the schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| and if there's any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5399)|
| 1:30:00| that we need to be prepared for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| because we need a vote come next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| So, first and foremost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| we talked about the interview date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| We originally, as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| have set 16th, 17th, and 18th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5414)|
| 1:30:19| as the interview timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5419)|
| 1:30:23| for those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5423)|
| 1:30:24| And we, I had a conversation with Tammy Grissom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| with Tennessee School Board Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| and to kind of get her input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| and her suggestions on those three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| because we were gonna do a business meeting day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| a community meeting day, and then the interview day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| And she highly recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| she highly disagreed with three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5441)|
| 1:30:46| and she highly encouraged that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| no, she was pretty like, absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Just simply because her perspective was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| that we're asking people to take off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| from their primary jobs for three days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| and that's a lot to ask for a candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| So when she provided that perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| but we also knew that we wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| that we have the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| for the community to meet the candidates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| and also meet with business leaders as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| on top of a full day interview from our end as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| So we found a balance between what she highly encouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| and what we wanted to make sure we fit within our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| and that's where you're gonna see the schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| that Board Member Henderson worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| And she worked really hard on this, y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| I'm so proud that I delegated that to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Because she worked really hard on this schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| and I'll let her speak about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| Secondly, the interview questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| You all, I sent that out in email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| I know that didn't come with much context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| because we can't really deliberate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| so I apologize if anything was confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| But this is the opportunity for us to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| So the first set of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| that was from Tennessee School Board Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| that is a template that they provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| And we, as the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| thought that they were really good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| However, they were a lot, and a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| So what we decided as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| and this is what we're recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| for the whole board to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| is the Tennessee School Board Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| their recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| we would like the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| to already have those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| for them to come to our interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5550)|
| 1:32:35| and provide a 20-minute presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| answering those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| So like a performance task, or a take-home opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| for them to come prepared and do a 20-minute presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| that will walk us through each of those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| and we can write in criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| And then there's a second set of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| that we provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5571)|
| 1:32:52| And those are the same questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| from the last superintendent search,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| and those are the questions that we will ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| write live during the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| So the idea behind that is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| the candidates will come prepared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| that way that they can show up as their best selves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| in the presentation to give us a 20-minute presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| and then they will answer the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| that we, as the board, agree upon live in the session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| Tammy also recommended that 90 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| is the ideal time for the interview session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| Clarity on what was just presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Okay, so I got the two documents with questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| and the ones that had the one, two, three, four, five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| beside it, that's the one we're gonna send out to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| For the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5614)|
| 1:33:35| For the presentation, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5615)|
| 1:33:36| And then, I had another question, I'm spacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Oh, so then we're gonna talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5620)|
| 1:33:43| at some point, I don't know if it's tonight or Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| the actual questions that we're gonna ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5625)|
| 1:33:46| So that's what I was asking is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| we're gonna come up with 10 questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| and will we all be assigned a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| I mean, will we know who's asking what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| and so it's sort of very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| we're kind of going into the interview scripted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| which I think would be a good idea that we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| Yes, and so whatever questions that we vote on as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| those are the questions we have to stick to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| And so we can have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| about what those questions look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| but we will need to vote on those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5650)|
| 1:34:11| if that is the process that we wanna move forward with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| And will we kind of assign certain ones of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| to ask certain questions or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| or maybe just one of y'all from the committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| We can, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| If it's 10, we can all just take a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5666)|
| 1:34:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| Thank you all for the additional work, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| on the committee and over the last couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| When you said 90 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| does that include the 20-minute presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5676)|
| 1:34:36| Okay, so it would be 90 minutes total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| And that was this recommendation from Tammy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| from her experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| I don't know if this is possible from an Open Meetings Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| but based upon the process we went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5686)|
| 1:34:50| to edit our criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| I don't think any of us wanna relive that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| And I'm wondering if it would be possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| for anybody to recommend any changes to the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| send them to the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| and let them provide a final to bring to the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| based upon recommendations from individual board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5706)|
| 1:35:10| I'm sorry, can you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| Yeah, you had sent out a list of 10 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| You asked for feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| And I guess what I'm saying is instead of processing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5717)|
| 1:35:19| through all that feedback line by line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| can we send you, the committee, the feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| and say, we're trusting you as a committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| we're empowering you to select the final 10 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5726)|
| 1:35:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| That's an option if the board wants to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Instead of editing the questions together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| in a public meeting, which was a little bit of a hot mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| We can lift that up as a vote for next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| for sure we can make that a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| I would be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5742)|
| 1:35:43| Sorry, Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5743)|
| 1:35:47| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I appreciate Mr. Watson's consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| of shortening that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| but I would actually like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5757)|
| 1:35:58| a more confidential question process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| so that the candidates do not have our questions in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5761)|
| 1:36:05| So, and I believe what we did last time worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| We submitted, and I don't fully remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| but we submitted questions to our HR director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| and she compiled those and kept them confidential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| until we were ready to begin our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| And that way, people who are with us every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5787)|
| 1:36:32| would not have seen those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| People in the community will not have seen those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| Candidates who are coming in to interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5797)|
| 1:36:39| will not have seen those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| So the first time they would be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| is in that interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| So I would very much like to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| having Mr. Bolton compile those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| and keep them for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5811)|
| 1:36:53| and maybe we could each submit two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| and then he could take out duplicates or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| or reword or however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| Yeah, so that was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| that's what we brought that up in the committee as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| to see if there was a way to keep it confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| And Gary, if you can speak to that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| and if we need to do that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| what would that look like for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5829)|
| 1:37:16| I'm sorry, Madam Vice Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5836)|
| 1:37:17| would you please repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5837)|
| 1:37:18| Yeah, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5838)|
| 1:37:18| I know, I know, it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| And so we talked about confidentiality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5840)|
| 1:37:25| at the committee meeting regarding questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| And so we did talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| is there a way for us to do the aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| of what Board Member Owens mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5853)|
| 1:37:34| as to keeping the questions confidential until then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| Sure, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| So there's really two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| I mean, one option is to develop the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| in public as you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| The other option would be to designate someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| to develop the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| and then use those questions as a board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| the same questions for each candidate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| I mean, that's really your only two ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Obviously the questions would become public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| as soon as you all decide to use them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| but I mean, but you could have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| you could designate someone to develop those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| Could those questions be with our input to that person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| So we could send in suggested questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| and then that person could develop the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| You could, but those would be public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| I mean, when you're sending those in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| I mean, I think the question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| can they be developed confidentially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| I mean, they would have to be developed confidentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5917)|
| 1:38:39| by that designated person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| and then once presented, they would be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| But if board members are sending back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| then conceivably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| that could be part of the public record as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| Can somebody look back and figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| how we did this last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| They said you heard her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| what she was suggesting is we all send them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| to like someone that's not one of us maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5941)|
| 1:39:03| but someone like Scott Bolton of HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| he come up with 10 questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| Yeah, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5952)|
| 1:39:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| Draw too many parallels to last superintendent search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| because it was different structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| and completely open for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5958)|
| 1:39:20| But my recollection was that you all collaborated with HR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| Mr. Bolton's predecessor, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| and that HR really developed those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| and then brought them to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| to make sure that the board was good with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| And then I think they were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| right before you all just rolled into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| Right before the interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Ms. Owen, were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| I'm thinking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5990)|
| 1:39:52| Maybe we could just have a conversation with Mr. Bolton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| about what we would like to see in the questions with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=5995)|
| 1:40:00| Mr. Bolton, would you like to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| Madam Chair, board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Ms. Owen, could you repeat the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| I'm trying to determine how we can have input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| into the questions without the candidates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6011)|
| 1:40:15| having the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| So maybe we need to reach out to your predecessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| and figure out how we did that last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| My question is to what would be the intent of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| And the reason why I ask is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| since these are a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6032)|
| 1:40:37| any superintendent that desires to have this position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| I would think would be following this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| and would probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6043)|
| 1:40:45| if the board presented the questions as public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| would come together with a real great formalized answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6048)|
| 1:40:52| If that's the intent, is how that answer was formalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| and to the extent it was processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| Or does the board want to see how the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6059)|
| 1:41:03| answers the question on the spot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| Then it depends on the intent of what the board desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| as part of that interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| I mean, I think that since it is a public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6071)|
| 1:41:15| I don't think it gives any one applicant an advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| by hiding the questions until that given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| I think we're doing both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Since we have the first set of questions from TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| they would have those prepared responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| And then the second set that we would develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6093)|
| 1:41:36| would be on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| And of course, if those questions are determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| on Wednesday, then those questions are no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| I'm happy to help in any way that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| We'll be happy to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6109)|
| 1:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| I knew you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| Ms. Bounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| I understand what Ms., thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| I understand what Ms. Owens is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| because they are gonna have that ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| to take those TSBA questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| and formulate all of their answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| So I think what she's asking is for a more on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| just how would you answer it without thinking it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| for three days or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| I would remind the board that there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| that opportunity at that community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| that we talked about where, if you remember last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Ms. Owens, they were asked questions on the spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6146)|
| 1:42:30| by the community and people in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| that submitted questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6154)|
| 1:42:35| And the committee talked about how informative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6155)|
| 1:42:39| that particular meeting was in watching how they responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6159)|
| 1:42:45| without being fully prepared with said answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| So there still is that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| regardless of which way we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| And I don't know how Mr. Bolton wants to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| and you could reach out to Kelly and see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| or he could just take these 10 questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| that we kind of talked about as a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| and we use last time and kind of redo that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| I mean, that would give him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| if Mr. Bolton decides to do them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| and give them to us at the last minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| to ask the candidates, he could use this as a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| and add or delete things that he feels like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| needs, should have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| Does that make sense for someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| Okay, so anyway, there is still that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| regardless of which way we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| to have them think on their feet and on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Maybe this would satisfy Ms. Owens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| and anybody else, any other board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| if we were to, if you have a question or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| that you would like to see answered kind of on the spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6234)|
| 1:44:01| call or email to Mr. Bolton and let him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6241)|
| 1:44:08| as Ms. Bowne said, just let him incorporate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| into the questions to get them in a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| that satisfies these questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| as well as any other questions that board members have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6261)|
| 1:44:28| I think he would do, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| he would do a good job of incorporating them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| and that way they would stay relatively quiet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6276)|
| 1:44:42| until they were revealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| I agree, I think we can come up with an approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| to satisfy both types of questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| and I think both can be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| I know one of the things that we would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| our superintendent to be is nimble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| There's gonna be a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| that they're gonna be asked to be nimble on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| when they're actually in the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6305)|
| 1:45:06| So I think kind of seeing how they answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| those questions is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| If now's not the time, I do have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| about the schedule and I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| Yeah, so she'll tell us now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6315)|
| 1:45:16| but I wanna make sure that I'm hearing clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| for the question aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| So, because next week we gotta vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| So I will present a motion as what we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6323)|
| 1:45:27| and if anybody wants to make an amendment to that motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| and then we can vote on that next week, on that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6329)|
| 1:45:32| Oh, Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6332)|
| 1:45:34| Oh, on that, you keep confusing me when you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6334)|
| 1:45:38| oh, on that process, then that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| So that's what I'm hearing collectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| Just vote on the questions that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| Well, we don't, what is the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| What would be the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| I think what I'm hearing is that we are voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| do we want a set of questions that get in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6354)|
| 1:45:56| which is what you all are recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| and a set of questions that they don't get in advance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| and then who do we entrust to finalize those sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| So is it appropriate, Gary, for me to get a feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6364)|
| 1:46:07| of who wants anonymous questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| I mean, questions in advance or not in advance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| Is that appropriate for right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| Do you mean from board members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6376)|
| 1:46:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| I think, I mean, what, I mean, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| I think you all just need to discuss it, vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| would be our recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| And, you know, I mean, another suggestion may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| that board members just voice what types of concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| you may want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| And then if you're allowing Mr. Bolton and his department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| to formulate the questions, then allow him to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| But you all just communicate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| generally what you want to see in the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| and then that way, I think that would accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| the goal that you're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Mr. Bolton, do you feel, do you feel equipped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| and qualified and confident to be able to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6416)|
| 1:47:00| to be able to create superintendent questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| Madam Chair, board members, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| I feel like, I feel like we've got the folks on staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6425)|
| 1:47:07| that can pass the good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| You don't want to say it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| Love the confident answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| Yeah, I would be fine with Mr. Bolton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6439)|
| 1:47:21| taking care of those questions, and also would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220207?start=6441)|
