| 3:14:47| well aware of insecticides pesticides and what they can do to your pond and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11687)|
| 3:14:57| other things and also how they affect bees and so I would like you know if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11697)|
| 3:15:06| consideration of of the wastewater I am most concerned about that but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11706)|
| 3:15:13| appreciate your attention and I think that's he's covered everything else so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11713)|
| 3:15:18| that's it for me thank you thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| all right so I guess we'll just go off in order here so the pond so they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11723)|
| 3:15:37| correct they did this is a reissuing of a concept plan the main lot layout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11737)|
| 3:15:43| stayed pretty consistent with the original so what happened is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11743)|
| 3:15:47| original road used to be up on the plan North property line well that was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11747)|
| 3:15:53| to result in a about a 15 foot retaining wall right on that property line which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11753)|
| 3:15:58| is not constructible you'll end up cutting into you'll have to backfill to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11758)|
| 3:16:03| cut the wall in essentially that plan North property owner his properties very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11763)|
| 3:16:10| negatively impact just wasn't feasible so what we did is we shift that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11770)|
| 3:16:15| down you know kind of flared the road out put that turn around for the mail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11775)|
| 3:16:20| kiosk which necessitated moving the pond to the northern side of the road if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11780)|
| 3:16:28| can go to the grading plan you'll see that none of the water that was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11788)|
| 3:16:33| all the water that was going to the original ponds are getting rerouted into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11793)|
| 3:16:38| that new pond so the drainage pattern is not going to change we'll meet all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11798)|
| 3:16:42| Knox County requirements to you know hit the detention requirements we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11802)|
| 3:16:48| study you know the bucket there'll be a bridge crossing Meadow Creek we'll study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11808)|
| 3:16:53| all that get the appropriate permits we'll look at a downstream impact so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11813)|
| 3:16:57| that'll all be handled in permitting we we've done it it just not applied for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11817)|
| 3:17:02| yet so we know to work it's just a matter of now getting through county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| engineering with that but there is a swell in the back of those lots that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11826)|
| 3:17:11| abreast their property so all the stormwater behind the lots will go into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11831)|
| 3:17:17| a storm system collect to get piped to the pond that'll detain the water that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11837)|
| 3:17:22| should alleviate any impacts from our development on that as far as the drones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11842)|
| 3:17:29| go I'm not gonna control who buys the houses but we are calling out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11849)|
| 3:17:35| pre-certs an 8-foot privacy fence on the on both sides of the property so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11855)|
| 3:17:42| there they will have a physical property barrier that was negotiated in the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11862)|
| 3:17:47| concept plan so we left that on there and we extended it a little bit before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11867)|
| 3:17:50| the pool amenity area in regards to our concern about sewer and wastewater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11870)|
| 3:17:55| there's public sewer out there it'll go to West Knox's treatment plant so it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11875)|
| 3:18:00| it'll go into a gravity sewer system well actually I think it'll probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11880)|
| 3:18:06| a low-pressure sewer system but it'll get to the gravity system to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11886)|
| 3:18:09| wastewater treatment plant so the main thing was the pond moving it it moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11889)|
| 3:18:15| the other side of street but it's still collecting the same amount of water from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| the original concept it'll collect all the subdivision water you know it'll act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11899)|
| 3:18:25| like a normal detention pond I can answer any questions you guys have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11905)|
| 3:18:29| otherwise we just we'd appreciate recommendation per staff approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11909)|
| 3:18:34| approval per staff recommendation thank you thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11914)|
| 3:18:38| Commissioner Smith Thank You mr. chairman and this is more just I guess a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11918)|
| 3:18:43| for engineering if we could go back not to that one go back to the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11923)|
| 3:18:48| where the current attention pond is in the case file keep going up now the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11928)|
| 3:19:00| that shows the satellite view yep so what I'm seeing here and this is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11940)|
| 3:19:07| I'm curious it looks like that detention pond is about a third on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| these property owners line but what they're saying is is they're gonna move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11951)|
| 3:19:22| that part of that pond is gonna go under the new one different okay sorry I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11962)|
| 3:19:30| on the wrong lot so that's why I was that's why I was confused so now y'all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| answered my question so that's all all right Commissioner Higgins I have two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11973)|
| 3:19:39| questions for the applicant maybe engineering I'm curious this is a just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11979)|
| 3:19:47| a technical thing I'm seeing on here with the mail turnaround area there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11987)|
| 3:19:53| seems like it would make more sense for it to be on the opposite side of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11993)|
| 3:19:57| road where people are coming in you know be able to check their mail on their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=11997)|
| 3:20:01| in on the way home is there was there a reason yeah it's it's a grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12001)|
| 3:20:09| constraint so there's a creek that runs through there and the slopes on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12009)|
| 3:20:14| other side of the street to get the detention pond in we couldn't stick it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12014)|
| 3:20:19| out that direction so with a geometry of the road it necessitated to be on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12019)|
| 3:20:25| side are people going to be able to or I guess whether they're supposed to or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12025)|
| 3:20:32| is there do a turnaround concern of people pulling in there on the wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12032)|
| 3:20:37| side of the road and traffic conflicts with that it'll be difficult to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12037)|
| 3:20:43| with the boulevard but the potential of them doing a turnaround while in it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12043)|
| 3:20:50| exhibit but I don't anticipate them I mean I don't I never say never we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12050)|
| 3:20:56| how this goes but it'll be more difficult with that boulevard going all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12056)|
| 3:21:01| the way to the extent there that's for them to do that and then the step out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12061)|
| 3:21:05| the back is that for this may have been covered and I missed it is that for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12065)|
| 3:21:10| phase two I'm sorry say the stuff out in the back no it's it's just for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12070)|
| 3:21:17| lots that's just a hammerhead turnaround I gotcha yeah so now well I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12077)|
| 3:21:24| at the max density we're close to the max density so there's no phase two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12084)|
| 3:21:29| planned on this one okay thanks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12089)|
| 3:21:34| Commissioner Adams could I ask the opposition I'm sorry I did not get your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12094)|
| 3:21:41| last name a question Jackson thank you a question because as we were talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12101)|
| 3:21:47| about the ponds I saw you all raise your hand that I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12107)|
| 3:21:50| please please come up so I can if your questions were answered or if they if as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12110)|
| 3:21:57| we were talking about the ponds and another one propped up yes upon the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| fence in the height oh one thing about the fencing along the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12121)|
| 3:22:09| they're proposing in an 8-foot fence but the ground would be raised higher and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12129)|
| 3:22:15| what value would that have on privacy so that they've got a fence that's 8 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12135)|
| 3:22:25| but the length but the ground the ground is much higher so the house is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12145)|
| 3:22:31| it's going to be set way above and our our field is down here so there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12151)|
| 3:22:39| privacy because you can sit there and look out over over onto our property and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12159)|
| 3:22:45| the what we were asking if perhaps we could have some type of it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12165)|
| 3:22:53| landscaping buffer in order that we would be able to have some type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12173)|
| 3:23:00| privacy along that area that's what we were getting at okay okay I think I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12180)|
| 3:23:06| tracking okay thank you thank you um it is so I'll turn back to the staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12186)|
| 3:23:15| Commission if that's possible for us to modify this to require a buffer that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12195)|
| 3:23:22| adequate to address that height difference okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12202)|
| 3:23:30| director Brooks is reviewing to see if they're I hear the cause required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12210)|
| 3:23:35| buffers yes Commission could add an additional condition I was just reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12215)|
| 3:23:47| the conditions miss Warner there's not any other condition associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12227)|
| 3:23:52| buffers correct out of these eight no just the fence yeah could I have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12232)|
| 3:24:02| assistance from planning about how to how to articulate variants that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12242)|
| 3:24:09| accommodate the height issue that the opposition was concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12249)|
| 3:24:18| I think typically like type B landscape screening is a typical buffer did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12258)|
| 3:24:27| hear that I think she said a type B landscaping buffer I think that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12267)|
| 3:24:31| and so I am you know honestly in terms of the topography of the site that's one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12271)|
| 3:24:35| thing I was just considering as I paused mm-hmm but yeah so a type B is one that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12275)|
| 3:24:41| could be considered in terms of the evergreen okay which I think is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12281)|
| 3:24:46| would meet their address some of their concerns okay go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12286)|
| 3:24:57| commissioner Adams you I'm trying to make a motion but I think Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12297)|
| 3:25:02| Huber had a question so okay Commissioner Huber so I mean with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12302)|
| 3:25:06| and this might be to the the neighbors as well mr. Jackson miss Jackson I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12306)|
| 3:25:10| would you rather have a landscape buffer or offense because I have horses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12310)|
| 3:25:23| I would like to have the fence and the landscape buffer because the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12323)|
| 3:25:29| buffer would allow more than likely the less sound with the drone mm-hmm but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12329)|
| 3:25:40| fence would help because I have animals there and I would like that to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12340)|
| 3:25:47| as well understood thank you I guess I could throw that same question to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12347)|
| 3:25:54| applicant if they're if that's something they're comfortable with I don't know I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12354)|
| 3:26:03| got one question for you how are the animals contained now if there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| fence yeah I get that but does the horse just okay if you feel approach a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12368)|
| 3:26:29| podium miss Jackson so when you have a community where you have a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12389)|
| 3:26:38| on that side there's more of a temptation to come over on your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12398)|
| 3:26:43| to pet and give carrots to the horse and that's what that's what I'm trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12403)|
| 3:26:49| prevent you know in the and understand not a mention a lot of digestive upsets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12409)|
| 3:26:55| because of the problem too but anyway that's the reason for that thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12415)|
| 3:27:00| all right where do we leave off um well I have a question because about because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12420)|
| 3:27:07| I'm now remembering this is the one with lots of motions it's exactly well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12427)|
| 3:27:17| I've got a drone question and then I have a question about to which of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12437)|
| 3:27:24| motions it would be most appropriate for me to add this landscape buffer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12444)|
| 3:27:29| fence variance to add an additional condition it would be motion 5 which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12449)|
| 3:27:35| the concept plan so approve the concept plan subject a condition so it'd be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12455)|
| 3:27:39| night it would be a nice condition okay and we are currently we need to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12459)|
| 3:27:47| through the variances first before we go through the concept plan so then I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12467)|
| 3:27:53| shift gears for just a moment to ask about the drone because I have seen them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240208?start=12473)|
