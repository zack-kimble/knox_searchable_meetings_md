| 0:05:12| Where is it being held?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Jim, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=315)|
| 0:05:17| The Public Works Facility, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| Well, I'll go on with what the Mayor had to say in addition to that, Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| The budget retreat on February 10th starts at 8 a.m. at the city's new Public Works Service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=328)|

| 0:05:38| That's almost the end of her report, although there is a special guest who I'll now introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=338)|
| 0:05:45| Lieutenant Colonel John L. Dice, State Chair Emeritus of the Employer Support for the Guard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=345)|
| 0:05:52| and Reserve, is here tonight to present an award to Police Chief David Roush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| The award recognizes KBD and the Chief for their deep commitment to and support for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| Knoxville officers serving in the National Guard and Reserve Forces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=363)|
| 0:06:08| Colonel Dice, would you please introduce yourself again and speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=368)|
| 0:06:13| Well, you've done a great job of that, so we'll cut right through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| I'm grateful to be here, and thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| If I could have Chief Roush join me down here, and there are really, I guess, two reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=380)|
| 0:06:25| that I'd like for him to stand beside me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=385)|
| 0:06:28| The first one is personal, because I'm given to understand that this room has a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| of attorneys in it, and so I'm pleased to have Knoxville's top cop beside me, much safer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=398)|
| 0:06:40| There are, in Tennessee, 350 police departments, and I have been engaged, one as a soldier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=400)|
| 0:06:48| for 30 years, and then working with Employer Support for Guard and Reserve, which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=408)|
| 0:06:53| Department of Defense agency, promoting just what the name implies, employers supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=413)|
| 0:06:59| their employees who serve in the National Guard and Reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| You might not take a great deal of note, but it was on this date, 26 years ago, that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| military kicked off Operation Desert Storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=429)|
| 0:07:13| Since that date, we have been continuously engaged in that area of the world on the global| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=433)|
| 0:07:19| war on terrorism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| To date, we've had some 900,000 different individuals from the Guard and Reserve called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| up to military duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=448)|
| 0:07:30| Currently, there are slightly over 28,000 Guardsmen and Reservists on active duty, out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| of our workforce, out of our neighborhood, out of our families, and so the support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| the community, support of employers, is critical, and I can assure you that there's not a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| enforcement department in the state of Tennessee that does more, or cares more, for their employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=469)|
| 0:07:56| than does the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| It's a pleasure to work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| It's a pleasure to recognize their support, especially their chief and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| On behalf of the 13,000-odd Guardsmen and Army Reservists, Naval Reservists, Air Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Reservists, Coast Guard, in this state and in this city, I would thank you and express| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| our appreciation for your support, and if we could get a grip and grin here to commemorate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| this, I'd be ever so grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Chief, would you like to say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=504)|
| 0:08:46| I'll be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| Well, first of all, thank you to my friend, Colonel Dice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| He's probably one of the hardest workers, as a retired military, that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=534)|
| 0:09:00| He is constantly looking out for our service members and assuring that they have the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| that they should get, and he's there all the time for both our active and our retired service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| members, and so we appreciate the Colonel, and he's always looking to help us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=554)|
| 0:09:21| always seeking to provide assistance where we need, and so we appreciate him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| And clearly, I would tell you, if you're an employer, it is an honor to have service members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| work in your employ, and I would tell you, any support that you can provide them, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| at all, be there for them, be there for their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| We currently have a couple of officers that are deployed, and it's key to being there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| for their families, because they're very stressful times when their loved one has been deployed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=592)|
| 0:09:59| regardless of where it is or what they're doing, so thank you, thank you, Colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| We continue to work with our military.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| They are amazing employees, both active and retired, and former service members, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| would tell you, if you have an opportunity, hire a vet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| Let's give a hand to the Colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| Thank you, Colonel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| That concludes the Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| How about reports from Councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=628)|

| 0:10:37| One, on yesterday, Chief Roush also received an award yesterday at the Martin Luther King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=637)|
| 0:10:44| Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| I think it was the Distinguished Citizen Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=645)|
| 0:10:48| I maybe have the wrong name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Community Service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Community Service Award, so he's received two awards in two days, and well-deserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=656)|

| 0:11:23| anyone that would like to come to that meeting tomorrow morning in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=683)|

| 0:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Is Mr. Cadmus here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| We have up to three speakers, and we'll start with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=905)|
| 0:15:28| My name is Richard Cadmus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I live in Lenore City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| I have property adjacent to the subject property here, both next to it and behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| And first of all, I'd like to ask you to approve this appeal of mine and not grant the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=942)|
| 0:15:54| And there's a similar project that was granted, I guess, about four years ago for Hatcher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=954)|
| 0:16:06| Hill Properties or SAW II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| I guess that's S&W II or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| And that was for 43 units, and basically taking the setbacks and reducing them to virtually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=973)|
| 0:16:23| nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| And I oppose that, so I'm opposing this for all the same reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| However, my understanding is that to get the variances, you have to ask for just enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| to get the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| Now a person who is thinking about buying the property that has all the variances for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1001)|
| 0:16:48| 43 units wants to put up 24 units, which is considerably less than the 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1008)|
| 0:16:58| And it's just, well, if one thing leads to another, this is going in a funny direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1018)|
| 0:17:05| according to the rules and regulations of the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| Anyway, I feel like it's kind of a legislative taking in reverse of my property, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1031)|
| 0:17:25| there's no reason to reduce the side yard setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| There's no building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| There's no reason for it except to encroach on my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1051)|
| 0:17:37| And I know you're thinking, how does that encroach on your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| Well, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| It reduces the value of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| The visibility goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| I'm trying to sell this as commercial property, and visibility means a lot to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| My property is zone C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1077)|
| 0:17:59| This particular piece of property was zone C6, then it went to O1 or O2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| Now this is an R2 development, a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| It's the wrong development in the wrong place, but people have been using variances to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1090)|
| 0:18:17| the value of their property, not build the buildings on it, just increase the value of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1097)|
| 0:18:22| the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| And I don't think that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| But if you want to reduce the value of my property at the benefit of somebody else's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| value of their property, then I'll consider that a legislative taking of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1113)|
| 0:18:39| I would like to ask you to just go ahead and buy my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| It's for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| It has been for the last 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| And the price isn't going up, it's going down because of these variances and uses on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1128)|
| 0:18:58| I'm probably the only person speaking on my behalf here, although I've talked to neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1138)|
| 0:19:04| and some of them feel the same way that I do, that that's not a good place for an apartment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1144)|
| 0:19:10| complex, putting it right on Sutherland Avenue, getting rid of the 20 foot setback and putting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| the door right out so kids can walk right out onto Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1158)|
| 0:19:24| Just doesn't seem like a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| But since everything has been approved, I'd like to, if you're going to approve this or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1168)|
| 0:19:36| deny my appeal, if you're going to deny my appeal, then I would like you to come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1176)|
| 0:19:43| with an offer to buy my property or that will be, I guess, my next step to stop the legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| taking of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| Because that's what it's doing, in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| No, this is in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| So Mr. Hill is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| There's only one speaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| One speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| I mean, I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| I'm sorry, you have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Yeah, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| So how is, let me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1212)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, it went from 06 to 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| To 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1237)|
| 0:20:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| is generally a way more favorable zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| I would, you know, it's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| Well, C-6 is more favorable than O-1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| but O-1 isn't that bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| It's an office community there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Hold on, let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| And so did you have opportunity to purchase this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| No, but they came to me to purchase my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| and I was told during that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| that they paid $50,000 for the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| and that meant my property was worth maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| quite a bit less than I was asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| And so it went from 43 units to 24 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| I mean, I'm just having a hard time getting my head around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| how this is a worse deal for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| How this is a what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| Not a good, this is reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| He's going in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I mean, generally, the argument would be the other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| If we want to go from 24 and get a variance to put 42 up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| I mean, he's gone, or they've gone the reverse action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| So I'm just kind of trying to wrap my head around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Well, number one, not on the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| only from the ground to the end of the up, wherever up is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| So the footprint's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| The traffic is going to be very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| Because nobody, I don't think anybody really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| thought the 43 units were going to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| I don't know why anybody would loan money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| for a project like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| There isn't any street access on the property, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| It's only alley access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| And Sutherland Avenue is definitely in a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| a renaissance, if you ask me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| I mean, there's all type of development, mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| I mean, it's probably one of the best examples of mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| that there is in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1356)|
| 0:22:37| It's got everything in the world on that one street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| it seems like, all type of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| Not to interrupt you, but do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Well, you already interrupted me, and you'll get your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| You had your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| I'm just trying to, you know, understand the subject matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| here before you walk off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| In a way to help you understand the subject matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| if you go to the dead end barbecue place on Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| Avenue, and you look at the building that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| right next to it, to the west of it, it's a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1386)|
| 0:23:12| And it's got about three feet of side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| And on the other side of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| is a strip mall where the pizza shop is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| And there is about a one foot side yard in that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| That's the side yard there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I don't know how that happened, but it looks ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1408)|
| 0:23:33| But somebody has gotten some kind of variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| And every time you encroach on all the good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| that ordinances create, and rules and regulations create,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1421)|
| 0:23:46| and then you just forget about those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| there's something is going to, it's probably a zero sum game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| There's pluses and there's minuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| And in this particular zero sum game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| I'm getting all the minuses, and my next door neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| is getting all the pluses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| And that's, I'm just saying, if that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| what the council and the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1447)|
| 0:24:11| and the MPC wants to do, then go ahead and buy my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| and do everything you want to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Because that's what you're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| is you're taking away my ability to get what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:23| I want to ask for my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| I particularly think that this takes away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| one of my potential customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| You know, why buy the neighbor, why buy enough property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| to do the project if you don't have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:39| And I don't understand the side yard setbacks being granted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| because there's no rhyme or reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| There was no reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| That isn't a requirement of doing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| And you don't have to put it so close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| to the corner of Concord and Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| that nobody can see around there, either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| That's not, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Sir, you will have a chance for a rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| once we hear from the other side, but I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Is your property right now being utilized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| Are the two buildings that I saw, are they being rented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| or are they being used on your property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| No, my property is being utilized as for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| I had a house on three of the lots on Brock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| One closest to where this project is going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Right, part of the house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| You had a house that's now on a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| Is that what you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| That's now a vacant lot, because it was vandalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| and we caught the vandal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| And the prosecutor wouldn't allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| me to ask for restitution, and didn't ask for restitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| Although the vandal was a scrapper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| and he had plenty of money to pay restitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| So I had to take that house down because it was condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Then, while he was out on bail, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| lost the air conditioners in my other building on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| So I decided just to move out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| Excuse me, the reason I ask the question is that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| seems to me that if I had those three pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| that you have, and there's this complex going next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| I find it hard to believe that the value of your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| is going down when I go and look at the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| that your property is in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| I said both those buildings look abandoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| and it appears as though they have not been kept up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| Well, it's not both those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| I only own one building on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| The building next to it, which is covered with kudzu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| and it comes over to my property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| incidentally, is owned by somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| OK, well, it just seems to me that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| is going to uplift the whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| The other question I have, I was reading the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| My building's already been condemned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| and I'm taking it down as soon as I get the taxes paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| and can afford to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| That'll be soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| The other thing that I read in the MPC report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| in terms of the dialogue going back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| was that, is it true that you told Mr. Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| that if he bought your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1632)|
| 0:27:14| you wouldn't oppose this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| That was written in the MPC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| Oh, I'm certainly here sticking up for my rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1643)|
| 0:27:24| Then those would be his rights, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Do we have any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| You do have two minutes for rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| after we hear the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Is there anyone else to speak in favor of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| I have a question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Am I allowed to speak at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| You are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| I don't see the MPC rep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Is there someone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Dan Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1670)|
| 0:27:50| He's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Dan Kelly's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| Dan's beyond the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| I'm concerned about the public interest aspect of the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| I guess I don't really care what happens on the alley side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| so much, but Sutherland Avenue, to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| the building within five feet of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| concerns me that that's not exactly a healthy situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Number one, if the road has to be widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| you're in a heck of a situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| You've got to take the whole building down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| But not even a sidewalk can be built rationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| in a five foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| The way this looks on this map, maybe I'm misinterpreting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| But I wonder, one of the criteria for giving a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| is that it's in accord with both the spirit of the zoning laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| and in the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| And I don't know why we have to have a setback less than 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| feet so we can put a sidewalk or something someday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1718)|
| 0:28:40| and allow people to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| So maybe MPC can answer that for me if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| Dan Kelly, MPC staff, Mr. DelaValle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| the MPC staff and the planning commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| are not staffed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1738)|
| 0:28:59| They have their separate body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| The discussion with regard to the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| occurred at the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| The planning commission did hear the use on review request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| That application and that action has not been appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| The situation is there have been improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| done in the fairly recent past to Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| right at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| There is a sidewalk in place already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| along Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| Those are the two points in particular that you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| The Bearden Village plan talks about pulling buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| to the street and things such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| So from that standpoint, the use of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1781)|
| 0:29:46| for the residential development, considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| there's a major employment center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| I guess you would call it, right across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| the opportunity for that, that seemed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| to be in keeping with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| There are six or seven general standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| for approval of a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| After going through each of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| the staff and the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| found that they believe they conform to those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| and approved the site plan subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1813)|
| 0:30:18| to obtaining the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1818)|
| 0:30:20| And the Board of Zoning Appeals acted on the variance request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| and approved them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| So to sum up, as a planner, you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| have a problem with putting the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| five feet from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1834)|
| 0:30:34| And again, the plan itself, the Bearden Village plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| talks about pulling buildings up closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| It creates more of a pedestrian scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| There's close, and then there's at the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1843)|
| 0:30:45| And that's what I'm trying to find out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1845)|
| 0:30:46| It creates a pedestrian scale where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| people are more likely to interact along the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| as pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| And as Vice Mayor Grieve, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| said, or maybe as Councilman Pavlis said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| there is a significant amount of development and redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| activity occurring on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| I'm not quarreling with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| I'm just close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| He was at 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| He wants to go to five feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| That's what the BZA approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| I wanted to know if the planners thought that was a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1873)|
| 0:31:15| or whether you see future conflicts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1875)|
| 0:31:18| with the public interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| That's the focus of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1879)|
| 0:31:21| The staff and the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| recommended approval of their use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| which has the building set at five feet from the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| That was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| OK, we'll now hear from the respondent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Mr. Hill, you'll state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Tim Hill, 311 South Wise Garber Road, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| I'll respond to a couple of Mr. Kavis' comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| there, just to clear up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| He had every opportunity to purchase this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| He had appealed to me to buy his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| And I had, I guess his argument was so strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| that I offered to sell him our property at the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| that we purchased it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Or we would buy his property at the same per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| that we bought our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| And we felt like ours was more valuable because it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| was on the corner there at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| However, none of that really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Let me paint you a little bit of a landscape of Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| First of all, that is one of two primary entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| eastern entrances, going westward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| to what I would call the Bearden Village area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1964)|
| 0:32:47| And if people travel up and down Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| you realize it is a hodgepodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| It's probably a zoning nightmare when you look at the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| It is a great mixed use, but it is a zoning nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| So just to the west of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| we have Mr. Kavis, who has property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| that has been unused for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| If I'm not mistaken, he has been cited a number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| and has been, I think, asked or ordered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| to take the structures down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Just to the west of Mr. Cadmus, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| have an aging, I would call dilapidated mobile home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2009)|
| 0:33:35| park and a wrecker service that has an impound area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2015)|
| 0:33:42| To the east of our property, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| would be the northeast corner, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| have an old building called the Critter Barn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| Behind it, we have the mulch area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| To the west of it, we have another collection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2034)|
| 0:33:57| of old warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| To the east of the Critter Barn, we have a cinder block plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| Thankfully, the university bought the other block facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2046)|
| 0:34:12| cinder block facility, and did a tremendous improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| on that parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2057)|
| 0:34:20| We have Cherokee Village that's on the southwest corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| So I would ask any reasonable person, who are we harming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2065)|
| 0:34:33| Are we devaluing the mulch plant, the Critter Barn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| the condemned buildings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I'm uncertain about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| So we have a plan to build 42 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| That plan is on the shelf, but it is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| We could apply for that and have every right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| to do so, if we so choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| We believe that this is the eastern gateway to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| will be the Bearden Village, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| think it's very important that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| This is a $3.6 million improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| and I just see no consequences to this improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| So I ask that you guys, or that the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| supports our effort in continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| the development of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2119)|
| 0:35:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2121)|
| 0:35:23| Thank you, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2123)|
| 0:35:26| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| You have two minutes to rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Didn't you get to answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| I don't want to answer the question anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| Well, number one, I don't think it's a good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| to replace a potential $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2141)|
| 0:35:45| project with a $3.2 million project that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| doesn't really help anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| And when you divide up the available property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2151)|
| 0:35:55| and I'm just talking about the available property, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| you're doing is you're reducing the scope of the project that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| This is going to be a housing project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| I'm almost going to guarantee you, because of my age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| that this is going to be turned into a Section 8 housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2176)|
| 0:36:17| I don't think anybody really plans for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2177)|
| 0:36:21| But I lived in the neighborhood long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| to know where the school districts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2186)|
| 0:36:34| And I just don't see a good future for this housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| It doesn't have enough room to put even 24 apartments there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| Those kids or people are going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| to use the open space of everybody else's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| If the only place they have to park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| is in the alley around the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2218)|
| 0:36:59| you can't park on a bottleneck truck route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| to AAA Cooper and JFG Coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| That's a truck route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| And they're talking about putting residential houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| right up against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| You have 30 seconds, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| So the person that would be damaged by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| I'm here speaking on my behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| I definitely would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| The value of my property will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| And when I appeal your decision, if it goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| I'm pretty sure it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| That's going to be my pact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| Your time's up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Well, I think when we've heard this a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| from Mr. Hill, supported it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| And I think a multi-several million dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2276)|
| 0:37:59| development on Sutherland Avenue and increase our density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| is exactly what we need and what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| It's not going to devalue the property beside it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| or adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| It's only going to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| So based on that, I make a motion to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2289)|
| 0:38:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| We've had a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| Mr. Brown, Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2297)|
| 0:38:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2298)|
| 0:38:19| As a 6th District representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| I have not heard from any of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2302)|
| 0:38:24| groups in the 6th District supporting this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| nor have I heard from any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| And so therefore, I'm going to be voting no to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Any other discussion, Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2323)|

| 0:42:57| Ann Wallace, Deputy Director for the Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| Yes, that actually falls in line directly with the cleanup grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| that we've received for the property at the former McClung Warehouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Both timelines run concurrently for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| So this gives us the opportunity to get the property cleaned up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| and also to accommodate TDOT as they work to replace the Broadway Viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| How did they determine the price that the state's going to pay us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2600)|
| 0:43:24| They did a fair market value research and had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| appraisals done on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| They worked with independent title companies to appraise the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| and then gave the value to our real estate department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2614)|

| 0:44:51| Thank you, Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| Basically, this program provides additional online training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| for all of our firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| They already have literally hundreds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| of classes in firefighting that meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2706)|

| 0:45:19| and they're already canned and ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| We've talked to a lot of other fire departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| that already have this service, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| are very pleased with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| It's going to free up our training staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| to do more classes specifically designed for our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| and do more hands-on training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| So it's going to help us take our ongoing training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| to a new level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| So you focus the hands-on stuff with your own team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| and these guys get supplemental information online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Yeah, this will generally be like the precursor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| to the hands-on training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| Do you guys have a certain number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| of hours of training that each fireman's supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| to have each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2758)|
| 0:45:59| We do, and it varies for each firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| We have to follow the state's program, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| is 40 hours for each firefighter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| but there's also additional training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| that you have to do in EMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Everybody has to meet every year, vehicle extrication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| hazmat, that go well beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2775)|

| 0:48:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2931)|
| 0:48:51| I didn't have my light on at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Jim Hagerman's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2934)|
| 0:48:54| Jim, is this going to mesh at all with your efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| to put a sidewalk and some passageway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| around all of that heavy construction that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| going on on I-640?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| Yes, it will mesh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Joe may want to elaborate on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| but had a short discussion with the engineer who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| leading the development of the bicycle connection there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| And he said it fit right in with their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| It would complement their plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| And I actually don't know the details of how it complements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2967)|
| 0:49:33| because I don't know what Park and Recreation's plans are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| But staff is in communication and has it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2976)|
| 0:49:43| Joe's here, and he can give us a nickels worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2983)|
| 0:49:45| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2985)|
| 0:49:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2986)|
| 0:49:46| Councilman Joe Wallace, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| This property is an old Broadway, which is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| north of the 640 interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2991)|
| 0:49:53| It's adjacent to the Lynnhurst Cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| And the plan is to connect a greenway that currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| is in Adair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| It would run on the south side of Lynnhurst along the ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3000)|
| 0:50:04| and connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3004)|
| 0:50:04| This would get us a connection to old Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| And then from old Broadway, I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| the plan would be eventually to get through that 640 mess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| and get over to the Fairmont area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| So this enables you, I guess, as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3015)|
| 0:50:17| to get out of the traffic in the Hassett area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| and get on a greenway peacefully moving north on Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3020)|
| 0:50:25| Well, not peacefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3025)|
| 0:50:26| Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3026)|
| 0:50:26| If you've been on Broadway, you know how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3026)|
| 0:50:28| Next to Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3029)|

| 0:53:06| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3186)|

| 0:53:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3189)|
| 0:53:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| 11Q is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| to execute an agreement with KMF3 Lawn and Landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| to provide landscaping services to Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| and Scattered Sites, Smart Fix 40, and Sutchery Landing Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| for a total contract price of $46,644.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3211)|
| 0:53:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3212)|
| 0:53:33| Mr. Delibovit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Yeah, I don't know if Chad's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| I see David, but oh, he is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| It seems like 11, is that O?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| I guess 11O and Q, there's some overlap with landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| and services at Lakeshore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| How do they intermesh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| How do those two contracts work together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Yeah, Chad Weath, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Southern Grounds was the bidder that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| was approved for mowing of Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| and then landscaping of Henley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| I know that's a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| but we tried to group mowing contracts together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| and landscaping contracts together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| Something that we found over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| is a lot of people are good at mowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| a lot of people are good at landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| but not very many are good at both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| So it is a little bit confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3259)|
| 0:54:21| but the KMF-3 does have the landscaping at Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3261)|
| 0:54:24| and several scattered sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| And then Southern Grounds has the mowing at Lakeshore Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3266)|
| 0:54:28| and then the landscaping of the Henley connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| So you just got to keep one guy from mowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| the other guy's landscaping is him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| That's how it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| I think my wife needs another husband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| We'll put that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| OK, it's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3292)|

| 0:54:55| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Short recess for psychotherapy and then we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| 11R is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| to execute an agreement with B&B Lawn Services Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3304)|

| 0:55:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3321)|

| 0:55:30| 11S is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3330)|
| 0:55:32| to execute an agreement with Avalon Incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3332)|

| 0:55:46| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3347)|

| 0:55:56| 12A is an ordinance to amend the operating and capital budgets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| for fiscal year 2016-2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| Councilman Delavalle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Yeah, thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| I think I see Jim York way in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| This is primarily housekeeping and carrying forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| contracts and occurrences we've set in motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| in the last fiscal year, and I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3380)|
| 0:56:21| My only question is, how did we sandwich in an additional $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| for the regal relocation of the headquarters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| It seems like that's different in kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| It's a new approval, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3391)|
| 0:56:35| Again, Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| This has four parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| Again, most of them are technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| As you may recall, last year, the council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| authorized $7.9 million to go towards the relocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3405)|
| 0:56:51| of the regal facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| We ended up spending $7.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| but because all expenses were not incurred nor encumbered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3417)|
| 0:57:03| at year end, that appropriation lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| And so we are basically taking some of the funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| would have been spent last year, had the bills come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| So just carry forward as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| It's not a new $150,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| It's just reissuing the $150,000 we didn't spend in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| For finance people, all those budget appropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| that ability to spend did lapse as of 6-30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3446)|
| 0:57:31| That's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| Anything that was unspent flows back to fund balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3453)|
| 0:57:36| and so we are appropriating fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| And this will be used to pay for such things as some legal bills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| But it's not really a change order type thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| No, this is not a change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3466)|
| 0:57:47| This is all accounting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3471)|
| 0:57:55| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3475)|
| 0:57:56| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3478)|
| 0:57:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3478)|
| 0:58:00| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| 12B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| 2, Section 4-56 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| so as to require either the permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3488)|
| 0:58:10| an employee of the permit holder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| or an agent of the permit holder to pour and serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| Vice Mayor Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3499)|
| 0:58:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| I feel like we need some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3501)|
| 0:58:23| about this particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| Currently, the Chapter 4, Article Division section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| makes an assumption that the pourer will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3511)|
| 0:58:33| be the permit holder or one of their agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| But it doesn't spell it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| So this is designed to spell that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| Meanwhile, it has come to the attention of the Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3523)|
| 0:58:45| and the city law department that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3525)|
| 0:58:47| is a new model for serving beer that is developing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| And that model would set some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| and allow individuals to serve themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| Currently, that is not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| So this is to help us buy some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| to come up with a plan and an ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| would allow standards for those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| that want to be able to provide self-service beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| Right now, we have one permit applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| who is talking about 32 ounces wristband and something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| That will be heard in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| But then there is another potential applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| that might want to pour 50 ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| So that would be a lot of beer for one person to consume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| The 32 ounces has raised some eyebrows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3584)|
| 0:59:47| because depending on the size of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| 32 ounces of eight-point beer is a lot of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| So this particular ordinance is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| designed to be punitive or disavow anyone's business plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| It's simply to give the law department and the Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3603)|
| 1:00:06| an opportunity to get together some models| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| and to come up with a way that perhaps we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| can do this service by the drink or pour your own drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| But is your desire to pass it on the first reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| The desire is to pass it on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3621)|
| 1:00:23| and then the second reading in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| Is that going to be enough time to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Actually, yes, it will be to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Because then we'll have to come back and amend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| this once we get a plan with standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| to have a different kind of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| So would that not be a significant change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| Would we not have to start all over again at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| I don't know, because we haven't investigated this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Perhaps Mr. Swanson, who is a veteran of Beer Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| adventures, might like to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| Or Mr. Frost, either one, I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Go ahead, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| I think Council Member Palmer really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| intends to make sure that the ordinance as it exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| is clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| And then after that's done, come with a review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| and let you all decide whether you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| want to change that ordinance to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| a different sort of business plan operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3687)|
| 1:01:30| to be permitted, whether you think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| the right thing to do or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| This will simply do that clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| that she's talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| And then you would have to come later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3698)|
| 1:01:39| Yes, you would have to come later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| and do the approval that would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| what we have termed in the law department the robot server.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| So if we pass this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| I guess Vice Mayor Grieve just asked this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| will this give you enough time to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| whatever suggested changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| And then if we change it, is that significant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| Or do we have to pass a separate ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| Yeah, that would be a totally separate ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3726)|
| 1:02:06| This will be an ordinance that you will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3726)|
| 1:02:09| change on second reading unless something strange happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| between now and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| My anticipation is that this will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| My anticipation is that this would come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3736)|
| 1:02:18| in its very same form in two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| and finish this out to clarify the ordinance as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Then there would be a separate movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| to create the ability to have this different type of serving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3746)|
| 1:02:32| plan is the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| Ms. Palmer, do we have at least one organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| that would like to start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| When do they want to start their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| I believe I'm thinking March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| We do have two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| Some of the people are from that organization, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| I'm thinking they want to start it in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| It would be my intent to get to the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| by the February 28th meeting a proposal for an ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3777)|
| 1:03:05| would address this issue if that is the desire of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| If the beer board decides we don't want to touch this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| and the beer board's not going to touch it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| but it would give us about six weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| to investigate, look at some models in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3798)|
| 1:03:21| look at the model that was presented by the poor group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| and come up with a plan that would set some standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| so that anybody who wanted to go to that kind of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| would know up front, this is what you have to do in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| to get that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| So you have about six weeks from tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| before we have another beer board meeting, at which point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| the beer board can look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Well, how long before we would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| be able to have something as an ordinance in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3836)|
| 1:03:59| to allow that particular business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| I mean, is that going to put it off to April or May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| No, if the beer board could come to agreement in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3843)|
| 1:04:08| then we could have an ordinance in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| before the beer board meeting in March| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3851)|
| 1:04:13| and approve it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| How would this group be able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| what they want to do without us doing anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| Are they allowed to do it under the present ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| But since they want to open in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| if we change to allow robot delivery of beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| for lack of a better term to describe a self-served beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| then that would give us time to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3881)|
| 1:04:44| that the beer board could be comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| the law department was comfortable with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| KPD was comfortable with, and then get it into an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| This is not like some past changes in policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| that we have examined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| It will not take three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3900)|
| 1:05:03| I think that was a slam, don't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3903)|
| 1:05:08| I feel a sign has been presented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| What I'm saying is that we can look at models in other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| look at what the wine server is doing on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| and find out what kind of problems they deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| what kind of capacity, how they enforce their rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| and then come up with something that hopefully everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| can live with or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3930)|
| 1:05:31| OK, so just for me to be clear, we're not talking signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3931)|
| 1:05:34| or anything, but for me to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| right now, if that business came to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| we could not give them a permit because we don't have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| Is that correct, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| OK, so this is a way we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| to work as fast as we can in order to get this done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3947)|
| 1:05:50| so that they can't open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| That's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| That is the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| So why are we needing to clarify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3961)|
| 1:06:02| Why not just wait for six weeks and bring the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| as we want it written and crafted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| I mean, we're trying to build a craft beer industry here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| and trying to create an environment of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| And I think we need the right tools in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| to be able to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| Yeah, that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| And it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3985)|
| 1:06:26| And the reason for it is because, frankly, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| had never heard of this type of business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| before when it came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| And when it came to us, the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3995)|
| 1:06:36| was, is that permitted under our current code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| We looked at our current code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| And we read the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| And we said, no, we don't believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| Our interpretation of the code, as it exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| we would have to come down on the side of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| no, that's not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| But it's not as clear as we would like it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| If we're going to have to survive a lawsuit on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| we would like it to be as clear as it could possibly be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| So when you're interpreting a statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| you try to interpret what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| And if it's not as clear as it needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| to be to make it as clear as it needs to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| then you just clarify it, which is what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| That doesn't mean that there's no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| to amend it in the future to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| for a different business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| But the way our code is currently created,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| we do not believe, as you read it, it would permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| And we want to make sure that's clear to everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4052)|
| 1:07:35| to give everybody fair notice of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| OK, but then in six weeks, we're going to be rewriting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| You very well may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4060)|
| 1:07:42| Not a thing wrong with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| Well, I mean, I'm in favor of creating it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4064)|
| 1:07:48| where it's straightforward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4068)|
| 1:07:51| I'm in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| I'm in favor of allowing some other alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| that we don't have to continue to create this, promote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4075)|
| 1:07:59| the craft beer industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| And I guess you didn't convince me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| that why we need to change it tonight and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| spend six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| I'd rather just wait and bring a new amended ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| as you see fit in six weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| If it doesn't, if they're not already permitted anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| so you've made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| I find it devastating that I haven't persuaded you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| But nonetheless, I really feel like from the law department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4102)|
| 1:08:31| point of view, we would like for our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| as it exists, to give as much notice to the public as it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| so they can read it and understand completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| what it says based on what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| We don't think that situation exists right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| And so we think it's fair to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| to clarify it so that they understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4131)|
| 1:08:54| what is and what is not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| And if we want to change what is and is not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| as time goes along, even coincidentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| at the same time, I wouldn't be opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| But I think it's important that you give the public fair notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| of what it says right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| Mr. Vice Mayor, do you feel better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4156)|
| 1:09:17| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4157)|
| 1:09:19| I'm not persuaded either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4159)|
| 1:09:20| Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4160)|
| 1:09:20| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4160)|
| 1:09:21| Oh, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| Mr. Swanson, I guess I'd spoken with Mr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| And has the administration taken a position on this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| Because I don't know how the administration takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| a position other than the mayor tells us what we should do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| and what we shouldn't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| And that has not happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| Carefully in the law department, Allison Dyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| in the law department has reviewed our code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| And she believes, based on her very careful review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| of this ordinance, that the ordinance would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4195)|
| 1:09:57| be better clarified in order to give the kind of notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| I guess the second question is, what in the current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| makes what the proposal not permitted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4206)|
| 1:10:12| Because that was a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4212)|
| 1:10:15| I don't mean to jump in, but I look at 4-56 in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| It shall be unlawful for any person or business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| to engage in sale, distribution, manufacture, storage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| or beer for resale without first making an application to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| and obtaining a beer permit from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| Well, if you read that as a, when someone applies for a beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| permit, they're coming in, their business, the owner applies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| the manager applies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| They are applying to get the privilege| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| of being able to serve beer or sell beer to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| and their employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| Well, the person, in the self-serve type of place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| they're not a employee of the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| They're not an agent of the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4258)|
| 1:11:03| Well, I mean, I think it comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| a little bit to the definition of serve and pour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| I mean, there's pitchers of beer served in a lot of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| And once those pitchers are served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| and sometimes they can be pretty large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| the patrons pour and serve beer to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4276)|
| 1:11:23| I just, I appreciate the thought about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4283)|
| 1:11:25| and I think it makes sense that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4285)|
| 1:11:27| should look at this new model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4287)|
| 1:11:28| But I agree with Mr. Wallace on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| that I don't see the rush to do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4291)|
| 1:11:35| I don't understand buying us time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| if we don't have to pass it and we'd still have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| And a couple of things that just bothered me about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4302)|
| 1:11:46| was that this is permitted in Asheville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| There's a location that's been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| three years and in other cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| And then also, right on North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| there's a wine bar where you'd serve yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| And I haven't heard any complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| and maybe the police department has heard a lot more than I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| have, so while I certainly respect the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| I'd make a motion to deny the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| There's already a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| There's already a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| There hasn't, so I'd appreciate a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| if anybody wants to second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| Let me clarify, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| I have not said that either the administration or the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| department has taken a position that we should not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| permit this new business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| I haven't said that at all, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| is what I think you're saying is that we shouldn't permit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| You haven't addressed it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4367)|
| 1:12:48| I'm saying what we want to do before we create the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| that I think I'm punching some kind of button up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4372)|
| 1:12:56| What the law department would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| before we come with an ordinance that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| would allow this new business model to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| the opportunity to consider this new business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4383)|
| 1:13:06| is to study where they're doing it other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| and see what type of limits would be appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| what type of cautionary measures need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| to be incorporated into the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| to make sure that we can enforce it as well as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| need to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| We're not saying that we shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| allow this new business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| We just ought to have a really good version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| of this new business model, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| would be in the process of studying that in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4412)|
| 1:13:35| department and bringing to you an ordinance that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| authorize this new business model,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| but with it being as good a version of that ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4421)|
| 1:13:45| as it could be, as opposed to trying to come in here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| and just guess at what we think the best thing is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| So I didn't want you to think that what we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4432)|
| 1:13:56| is it shouldn't be allowed to happen at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| But are you saying that the law department's interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| of the current ordinance, that it wouldn't be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| That was a surprise to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| I didn't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| And the bear board attorney and the law department attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4452)|
| 1:14:18| have concurred that as it presently exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| they can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Well, I mean, I think this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| and I guess we're going to hear from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| they've signed a lease, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| trying to start a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| And then I feel like if we pass this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| we'd be sending them the wrong message,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| that we don't want them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| There's vacant space on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| And so I just didn't feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4484)|
| 1:14:48| So that's why I made the motion to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you, Councilman Steyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4491)|
| 1:14:53| Councilman Della Vopi, you've been extremely patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| I don't have a lot to add to this almost endless debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| now, but I'm just confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Can we not just have a moratorium type provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| that we adopt until we get our studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| standards and stuff in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| I mean, you're doing the equivalent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| Do we need to amend the statute and then reamend the statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Or can we just pass on a moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| that we won't issue any permits for self-serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| until we get our new standards in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| Our belief is our current ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| is a moratorium because it doesn't permit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| But you'd like the belts and suspenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| of having the words actually say that so you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4529)|
| 1:15:32| confused if you go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4532)|
| 1:15:35| All right, I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Chief Roush, you heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| I just wanted to respond to the question about any concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4539)|
| 1:15:43| or complaints about the wine pour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| No, we haven't had any, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| you also need to remember you're talking two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| different types of customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| And I would tell you those who are beer drinkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| would take offense to being called wine drinkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| So it's two different types of tastes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| Is it the wings that make it different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| So I would tell you it's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| But as Mr. Swanson has made very clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4570)|
| 1:16:15| is we aren't against the model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| It's just we need to make sure that we have an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| of what the rules should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| We want to be careful and ensure that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| appropriate oversight, that the amount that can be poured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4586)|
| 1:16:32| is something that needs to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| And so I think we all understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| We want to make sure it's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| And that's the thing that I think we want to get to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Now, that's outside of the whole discussion about the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| And if you need it or not, that's your all's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4611)|
| 1:16:52| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| So is the referenced wine bar operating illegally right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| Is that what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| We don't issue permits for wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| OK, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| Yeah, that's just a beer issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| OK, we do have several people that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| would like to talk against the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4628)|
| 1:17:13| And Joel McLeed, who will come to the platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| and state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| Sorry if I sent the founder, Nate, up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| Sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| Can someone go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| If you'll come to the platform and state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| and address, you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| Nate Tomford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| My address is 117 Estelle Park Drive in Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| I'm the owner and founder of Poor Taproom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| And we've been in business for three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| We operate in three different states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| We kind of created this tasting room model, which is self-serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| And I just want to clarify the regulations that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| how important it is, how regulated we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| and that we're really to promote the tasting of craft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4688)|
| 1:18:11| beer, wine, and cider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| We have all three in one building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| And I would differ to say that craft beer is becoming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4695)|
| 1:18:19| more like wine and that people drink smaller samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4699)|
| 1:18:22| No offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| So the most important thing, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| think one of the council members addressed it, is you're already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| allowing self-serve in your city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| It's pitchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| It's yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| It's very large, larger than one drink at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| It's already happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| This is no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4722)|
| 1:18:43| We allow taps to control the ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4723)|
| 1:18:49| But it's no different than a pitcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4729)|
| 1:18:50| Or if I give you a bottle and you pour it into a glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| we're serving one drink at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| It's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| We take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| It's all regulated on this bracelet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| And so the technology is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| We really created it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4741)|
| 1:19:03| We created the self-serve model three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| And I would like to describe the process to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| so you can understand what happens when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| you come into a Poor Taproom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| So first of all, we don't allow anybody under the age of 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| unless they're with a parent or a guardian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| So it is not like you just come in and hang out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| and I can pass things from person to person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| I'm with a friend who's under 21, and I'm 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| and I just pass it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| Also, we employ the same number of people as any other bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| We have certified bartenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| They have a slightly different role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| in that they help and they host.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4778)|
| 1:19:42| And they are serving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| They're instructing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| It's very interactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4784)|
| 1:19:45| So it's not a robot bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| It's not like you come in, we turn your back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| and you do your own thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4789)|
| 1:19:50| It's supposed to be educational, interactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| and the number one goal is to promote local craft breweries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| We don't brew beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4795)|
| 1:19:56| So our purpose in every city that we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| is to showcase that local scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| That's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4802)|
| 1:20:03| So as you come in, we check your ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| We use a 2D barcode scanner on every ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| So I don't know how familiar you are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| But you scan the person's ID, whether it's a magnetic strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| or the 2D barcode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| That automatically tells us if that's a valid ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| tells us their age, their address, everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Nobody uses that that I know of in the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| that we operate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| And I don't think that too many people do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| So that is the first step that we take very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Then we're issuing a wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| I have this on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| And it activates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| So it's dead until that ID is scanned and activated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| So it's impossible to just grab a bracelet or go do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| You open a tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| You don't prepay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| So that's different than the wine bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| where you just drink till your money runs out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| That's a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4850)|
| 1:20:51| Plus, we're talking about high alcohol wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| compared to 5, 6, 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Yes, there are some higher ABV beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| So that's a big thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| Because there's only one drink allowed at a time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| And then that system cuts you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| So you cannot go to taps and pour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4865)|
| 1:21:07| It's literally impossible to get beer out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| There's a valve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| So that valve is stuck until this RFID reader| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| opens that valve up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Then we measure to the 10th of an ounce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| So it's very precise, similar to a flow meter at a gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| And as soon as you open that tap handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| you can pour a couple ounces and try something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| like, say, a flight at a brewery or at a beer festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4885)|
| 1:21:31| Then when you close that, it tells you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| how many ounces you've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4893)|
| 1:21:34| And it will not reopen again until it's scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| So it's not a free-for-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| It's not like just open taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| You pay $20 to get in and drink till you fall down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| It's absolutely not what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| It's extremely regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| You have a minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4906)|
| 1:21:47| OK, probably more regulated than any other bar around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| Legally speaking, you have to come up and find a bartender| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| and say, I would like to have another drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| At that time, we're doing what any bartender does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| We're assessing your speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| If you're stumbling, it's very serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| We're not just like free-for-all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4923)|
| 1:22:05| Each time you refill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Every single time you reach that one drink limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| So we're allowing freedom within the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| So you can try two ounces of this beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| three ounces of that beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| And then once you hit that one drink limit, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| we can set at whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| Right now, it's set at 32 ounces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4939)|
| 1:22:21| which would be like a tall boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| But it can be set at 16 ounces, which is a pint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| So we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4946)|
| 1:22:27| Our technology allows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| And so the bracelet, it doesn't care how good looking you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| how much money you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4953)|
| 1:22:34| It cuts you off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| You cannot bypass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| So it's very, very regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| And I would ask that, and I would debate the legal team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| that you're already allowing self-serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| This is not anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| In fact, it's more controlled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| So waiting another six weeks completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| deters the building that's leased and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| We've been operating legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Excuse me, your time's up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4980)|
| 1:23:01| And let's counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4981)|
| 1:23:04| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| I'd like to make a motion to suspend the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| and allow him for at least two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| I think this is critical to what we're trying to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| It's been moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5000)|
| 1:23:21| Ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| So please continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5003)|
| 1:23:24| Two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| First of all, does anyone have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| before I continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| No, just keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| So yeah, I don't see where in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5012)|
| 1:23:36| that it's illegal in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| to serve your own beer or pour your own beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| whether it's through a tap or a pitcher or a 100-ounce yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| I don't understand how you can interpret that legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5025)|
| 1:23:48| how it's not legal to do that when every single beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5028)|
| 1:23:51| place serves flights, serves pitchers, serves all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| So I think that sometimes there is an exception to the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| And because we've pioneered this and we take it very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| and you can certainly call and ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5043)|
| 1:24:05| any of the cities we operate in that take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| such good control of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| And we're talking about a tasting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| It's just not a place where you go and drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| We have all the statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Our average customer only drinks 24 ounces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| which is a total of two bottles of beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| Average age is 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| Average pour is 5.2 ounces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| We know that people aren't pouring pints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| They're trying different beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| And so that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| We can put 40 different breweries in one room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| and then people aren't driving around places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| and getting DUIs and hurting other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| So you can try all those beers in one place, be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| You could literally try 12 beers, drink 24 ounces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| and be completely safe to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| So I think that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| The goal for us is to highlight craft beer in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| to create a tasting room, not just drink and drink and drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| Craft beer is supposed to be consumed in small quantities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| for the flavor, for the taste of that beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5104)|
| 1:25:09| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5112)|
| 1:25:13| You know, it seems to me we're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| with two different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| Oh, I've got another way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| Oh, you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5118)|
| 1:25:18| Well, I'd just like to ask him a question, if I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5118)|
| 1:25:21| before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| So you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5125)|
| 1:25:26| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5126)|
| 1:25:27| Yes, there's another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5127)|
| 1:25:28| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5128)|
| 1:25:29| Go ahead, Councilman Pabst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Well, he's the creator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| I mean, he's the founder of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| so he's going to know better than anybody, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| So you operate in three other states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5138)|
| 1:25:39| So what has been your track record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5139)|
| 1:25:40| to date of violations, underage sales, any type of violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| that you've had?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| None at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5148)|
| 1:25:48| Zero violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| And how long have you been open in these other locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| We've been open three years total,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| and a year in Greenville, South Carolina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| and then I have some friends back in California,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5159)|
| 1:26:02| in Santa Cruz, California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| So I mean, it's one thing if a state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| it's illegal to self-serve, like Oregon, New Jersey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5170)|
| 1:26:13| It's illegal to even pour your own beer into a glass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5173)|
| 1:26:17| but it's not illegal in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| So you would be superseding the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5184)|
| 1:26:25| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| My apologies for overriding you, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| seems to me we're dealing with two different things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| This ordinance that we are considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| really doesn't have anything to do with what he's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| I'm not uncomfortable with what you've proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| but that's not what we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| We're dealing with a clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| of an existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Now, I understand it may not make sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| to clarify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5211)|
| 1:26:52| I would like, quite frankly, to bring clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5212)|
| 1:26:56| along with however we might want to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| this type of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| I think the difficulty would be, and Mr. Swanson can opine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| on this, but it's not just this organization that brings maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| a really good model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5231)|
| 1:27:13| Maybe that's the model we want to adopt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5233)|
| 1:27:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| But it's whoever else might do something similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| So what are the parameters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| So we're not trying to decide that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| We're trying to decide, do we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| to clarify our existing ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| or do we want to wait and have everything clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| in one ordinance that might deal with this type of activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| I would prefer the latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5253)|
| 1:27:38| OK, we do have one other speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5258)|
| 1:27:41| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5261)|
| 1:27:42| Yes, I guess I'll direct my question to Attorney Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| or whoever wants to take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| But you may have touched on it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| but have we looked at the ordinance in Asheville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| and Greenville of those cities of similar size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| as opposed to what we have now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| Have we looked at that already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| Are we planning to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| We're planning to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| I mean, I believe there's a similar restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| maybe restaurant's the right word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| business out in Denver, Colorado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5289)|
| 1:28:13| A lot of what government does is react to things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| And this is a new idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| While personally, this business sounds like a good business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| that I might like to patronize myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| the question is if you have a business that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| not as well run as this gentleman founded here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5314)|
| 1:28:39| And these people have a good business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5319)|
| 1:28:42| And obviously, they have a plan that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| worked well for them where they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| said they've had no problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| But that business model and those regulations that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| have are presently self-imposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| They could change that plan, or somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| with a different business, the competitors of theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5336)|
| 1:29:00| they could come in with a plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| doesn't sound as well regulated as this place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| So we're looking for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| Ms. Dyer and the law department and I, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5349)|
| 1:29:11| had a meeting before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5351)|
| 1:29:12| We've talked about this before, about possible ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5352)|
| 1:29:16| to allow this business to come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| that there'd be some responsible regulations to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5359)|
| 1:29:24| that there's not a problem caused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| by this business or any business that has yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| to come into the Knoxville market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5370)|
| 1:29:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5377)|
| 1:29:37| We do have one more speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5377)|
| 1:29:38| But as Councilman Saunders said, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| I think this is the law department, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| you're looking for is you're looking to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| our existing ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| And at the same time, during this time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| you're going to be looking, as Councilwoman Palmer said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| you're going to be looking at being able to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| at other models to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| And so regardless of what we really do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| they can't operate anyway until this is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| until it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| So even if we pass this or don't pass this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5410)|
| 1:30:13| you folks are still going to be working diligently in order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5413)|
| 1:30:17| to come up with the right wording for the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5417)|
| 1:30:20| for us to pass, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5422)|
| 1:30:22| On that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5422)|
| 1:30:23| So it's just a matter of, I guess, the chicken and the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Which one comes first, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| But let's hear from Mr. McLeed, if I say that correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| if you'll come to the podium and state your name and address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Vice Mayor, I might interject there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5437)|
| 1:30:40| while he's coming up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| I mean, it's arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5441)|
| 1:30:42| I think that the position on it is arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| And what they're trying to do tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| is slam the door shut and say, it's not arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| This is black and white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| And that's what I take out of Mr. Swanson's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| It's arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| Well, I think the position's arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5455)|
| 1:30:56| I mean, now, so he's trying to make it where it's slammed shut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| that this would not be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| Now it's clear that it's not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| And today, it's arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| He says it's permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| You're saying it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| What's been presented here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| would say it's absolutely not presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| Virtually anything is arguable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| We're trying to bring as much clarity to the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| as we possibly can and advance notice to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| who are looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| So if there is any vagueness there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| we want to do away with the vagueness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| We don't feel like it's vague, but somebody else may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5494)|
| 1:31:41| OK, sir, state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| And you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| My name is Joel McLeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Address is 4926 Oak View Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| Sorry, I just moved here Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Everything's not committed to memory yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| Originally, I did have a script planned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| but I think Nate covered on some of it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| So I'm going to see if I can pick and choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| from this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| So excuse me if I go between reading and ad-libbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| So hi, my name is Joel McLeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| I'm one of the co-owners of JMSC LLC, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| will be doing business as Poor Taproom Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| I've licensed the idea from Nate Tomford, who currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| has three locations open nationwide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| three others in planning, not even including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| the ones that we're trying to open up here in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| We're worried about other people coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5541)|
| 1:32:23| The technology company Poor Taproom, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| have given me the rights to an entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| In this case, pretty much the entire area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| is the city limits of Knoxville all the way out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| to Turkey Creek, the Farragut area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| The reason I mention this is to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| that Poor Taproom Knoxville and Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| is hopefully not our only location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| We chose Old City for its obvious potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| due to its gentrification efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| by the city and local business owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| However, if the regulatory landscape changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| dramatically enough, we might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| to revisit our expansion plans and look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5572)|
| 1:32:53| at other areas, i.e.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Chattanooga, Nashville, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| As I was just saying, my wife and I just moved here on Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| We did uproot our lives to make this dream become a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| We did check legalities, conversed with the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| as much as possible, and verified in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| we thought was the current city ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| that this was legal before making our move here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| and putting everything into motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| We visited the town quite a few times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| to talk with our investors who already lived here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| scope out the competition, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| We did email the beer board for quite some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| for help and guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5602)|
| 1:33:23| Unfortunately, communication was ceased there for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| Our research did bring us to the drink| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| that we have already referenced, the self-served wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| bar that's inside of Knoxville city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| Now, I do understand that wine is governed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| by a completely different entity than beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| but we are having a hard time understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5619)|
| 1:33:41| why certain government bodies would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| be OK with wine, which has a higher alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| percentage, but not beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5627)|
| 1:33:49| And even with the new alcohol cap that's in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| would still be less alcohol percentage than wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| I did give you guys a pamphlet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| If you go all the way to the back page there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| you'll see a picture that I printed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| And I hate to throw anybody under the bus here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| but that picture is taken from Carolina Alehouse's Facebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| So this is what's currently available, basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| from smallest to largest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| If you look at that, it's a pint, a mug, five beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| a pitcher, and from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| that is a 100 ounce beer tower that's brought to your table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| with a pour spout on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| There is nothing whatsoever that keeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| one patient from drinking any of these choices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| completely by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| And in any case, as some other people have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| once that pitcher beer tower is brought to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| you do pour it yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| As Nate touched on, the tasting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| does have multiple safety protocols built in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| to keep this kind of overindulging and overpouring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| at bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5681)|
| 1:34:41| First and foremost, we do scan and verify everyone's IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5681)|
| 1:34:45| The system cuts them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5685)|
| 1:34:47| Currently at a two drink default limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| They have to come back to one of the certified servers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| that we have there to check in with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| or the wristbands don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5695)|
| 1:34:56| Those taps will not work without that wristband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Our research has also shown from the other three active stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| as he was saying, that most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| aren't pouring a full pour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| They're looking at it from a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5705)|
| 1:35:06| to a half a glass at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| Most people don't want to commit to a full pour of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| anymore, especially with all the options that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| are available out there in the craft beer market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| And please note, the self-serve aspect of our establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| is a gimmick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| After the first visit to our business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| the novelty of pouring your own drink wears off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| And people's next focus is on just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5725)|
| 1:35:27| what they want to try next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5727)|
| 1:35:28| The point of the self-serve aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| is to allow the customers, not the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| dictate the serving size that's in your cup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| And finally, as we said, we are a tasting room, not a beer bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5736)|
| 1:35:40| I have 68 taps on order right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| And basically, from right to left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| there's one water, one root beer, 50 beers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| eight gluten-frees, which consists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| of ciders and meads, et cetera, and eight wines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5750)|
| 1:35:53| on the other side, four reds and four whites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| If this ordinate passes, this means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| I only have to staff a bartender at the beer taps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| not the ciders, the meads, and the wines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| where customers would still be able to go and pour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| themselves their own drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5766)|
| 1:36:07| So we ask you to oppose this ordinance currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And I thank you for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5770)|
| 1:36:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5775)|
| 1:36:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| You have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5779)|
| 1:36:19| If I could ask this gentleman while he's there, Mr. McGlynn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| what do you do in this type of operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| where someone who's still within their 32 ounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| or whatever the limit is, is getting tipsy or whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| I mean, how do you intervene and cut someone off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| so that they don't abuse alcohol or their personal condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| that doesn't allow them to drink a certain amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| In other words, what controls other than the wrist RFID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| No, it's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| I mean, I was a bartender for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| Basically, everything almost comes down to visual scanning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| As Nate said, we don't turn our back on the customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| I'm not sitting behind my little computer screen and POS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| system and just watching the money roll in, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| There might be one person manned there the whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| But for the most part, there's four or five people always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| out on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5828)|
| 1:37:09| They're always busting drinks or taking the cups back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5829)|
| 1:37:13| to be cleaned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5833)|
| 1:37:13| They're talking to you at the taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| What do you like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5834)|
| 1:37:15| What's this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5835)|
| 1:37:15| And I think through all that visual scanning, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| that just keeps everyone a little more touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| So even before, if the bracelet hasn't kicked in yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| so to speak, I can very easily go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| You can spot someone who's getting inebriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| It almost becomes second nature after you do it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| industry for so many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| The second question is, is your business hurt in any way if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| this body and its legal departments and advisors spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| a few weeks looking at all the details and coming up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| their own version of a poor, safe ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| In other words, you're not even ready yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| The pictures on TV showed an empty room and you're building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| it out and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5878)|
| 1:37:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| Much to my chagrin with my architect in GC, but I won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5883)|
| 1:38:03| It's always that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5883)|
| 1:38:04| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| The worst damage as of right now, I think when we first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| heard of this ordinance, it came in, we went through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| five-minute anger phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| And you're just like, oh my god, we're ruined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5894)|
| 1:38:15| It's absolutely this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| And it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| We want to keep the gimmick alive and allow people to pour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| their own drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Worst case scenario, my labor cost goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| That means instead of maybe having four people on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5905)|
| 1:38:32| floor that are having to man and rotate the whole floor and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| bust drinks, that means I have to have probably two people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| standing, again, at the beer taps only, and taking the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| people and going, well, what would you like today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| And they go, this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5924)|
| 1:38:45| I go, OK, turn on the taps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| And I pour their drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| Say when, turn it back off, and hand the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| drink back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5930)|
| 1:38:50| So for me, it's only taking about five or six seconds out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| per transaction out of my day per customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5934)|
| 1:38:58| Nate has informed me at his other tasting rooms that at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| any one time, even on his really, really busy Friday and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| Saturday nights, that there's really no more than five or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5945)|
| 1:39:07| seven people at one time ever pouring their own drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| So if I might have to staff two people labor cost-wise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| that's the huge detriment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| Your best guess for when you're ready to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| When's construction going to be finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| Optimistically, we would be ready by the February 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| The realist in me says April 1st instead of March 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| Well, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| We're just trying to figure out scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| Because their goal is to try to come up with a thought-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| process for permitting these activities in case some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| entity other than your own that's less careful just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| seizes the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5981)|
| 1:39:42| And that's the idea, is buy a little time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| for smart governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| So I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5987)|
| 1:39:47| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Our only concern, as I said, is that I have 68 TAPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| You'd only be asking me to man 50 of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| But that won't be till April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5998)|
| 1:39:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5998)|
| 1:39:59| And we could all come there and, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6002)|
| 1:40:02| You're all invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Try the tasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6006)|
| 1:40:07| Just to close out, this body, we're supposed to, in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| type of thing, legislate what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| I haven't heard of anyone argue that this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6019)|
| 1:40:24| should not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6024)|
| 1:40:26| This ordinance makes it clear that this group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| should not be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| So why would we pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6030)|
| 1:40:32| I mean, to me, I just don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6032)|
| 1:40:36| The only arguments is to buy time and to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| Well, I agree with Councilman Wallace that it's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6041)|
| 1:40:45| not clear from the current ordinance or there wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| be an argument to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| I certainly was under the impression that under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| current ordinance, it was permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| So I think when we're passing an ordinance, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| need to look at the ordinance and look what it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| Is that what we want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| And I haven't heard any member say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| this is what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| This is what they think the law should be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| So to me, I think we should deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| And if we come up with something different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| then we can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| But it seems like there's a consensus that a group like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| this, at least a group like this, would be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| establishment that we would want permitted in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| I think that, first of all, I don't think anyone on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| is opposed to the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| I think that what we're trying to say is that with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| the recommendation of the law department is that their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| approach would be first to clarify what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| But at the same time, while they're doing this, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| going to be working on getting this ordinance together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| And according to Council Lady Palmer, there's a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| process they want to go through and they would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| for us to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6121)|
| 1:42:03| And it sounds as though that it's not going to affect this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| particular organization that's trying to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6126)|
| 1:42:08| Well, why do we need to clarify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Because the law department's asked us to clarify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| That's not our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6133)|
| 1:42:14| Our role is to pass legislation and what we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| the law should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| We decide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| Well, but there's thought that the present ordinance is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| clarified on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| So, Councilman, oh, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6147)|
| 1:42:30| Yeah, with all due deference to your role as a legislator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6150)|
| 1:42:35| the administration decides on matters of enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| And we're going to decide what the ordinance, how you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| properly read the ordinance as it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6161)|
| 1:42:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Do you agree with that interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| Going back to Civics 101 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| But unless you think that, if you think that beer must be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| poured and served by, must be served by an employee of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| permit holder, if that's what you think the ordinance should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6181)|
| 1:43:05| be, then you should support this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| But it sounds like that members of this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| that's not what we think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| We think that this business and their whole model is where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| customers serve themselves is permissible, then why would we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6196)|
| 1:43:20| pass an ordinance that says that it's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Well, I'm fully in favor of you making that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| because that's a policy decision, whether you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6206)|
| 1:43:29| permit this business model or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| And I'm perfectly willing, more than willing, in fact, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| think it's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| I kind of like the sound of the business model, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| think we ought to have an ordinance in place that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| regulates it appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| And so I would like to give you the opportunity as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| legislator to make a decision that that would be the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| appropriate ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| What we have now is an ordinance that could be, by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| some judge somewhere, found to be vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| We don't want that to be the case under any circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Whether you decide this business model ought to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| permitted or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| Council Lady Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6253)|
| 1:44:13| My concern is not with poor taproom, because it strikes me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| that they really thought this through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| They have a lot of real specific safeguards in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6260)|
| 1:44:24| And so I would not be uncomfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6264)|
| 1:44:26| with poor taproom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| But we've been on this beer board long enough to know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| we have applicants who would not as carefully think out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6270)|
| 1:44:37| what poor taproom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6277)|
| 1:44:39| And while they currently have a monopoly on the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| have this, we also know that things can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| change very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| And this is why I think that we need to have this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| brief as it will be, to be sure that we have maybe a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6292)|
| 1:44:57| taproom ordinance or a poor ordinance, as well as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| standard beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| I just think that we need to think it through, rather than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| say, yeah, because I think your idea is great, and I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| possibly be a patron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| At the same time, I don't like beer, but I possibly would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| intrigued with the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| But I just am not comfortable that everyone who likes this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6320)|
| 1:45:26| concept and thinks it's a great idea are as responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| as the people from poor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| And since they really don't think that they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| able to open until April the 1st, we have time to make some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| adjustments and enable them to do what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| And it may well be that your model is the model that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6342)|
| 1:45:47| becomes the legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| And so that anybody else who wants to do this has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| So it's not that we're opposed to your business or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6354)|
| 1:45:58| your business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| It's just that in looking at the variety of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| might decide this is a great idea, we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| responsibility to think about those other people, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6366)|
| 1:46:12| Any other Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| Yeah, and then we'll call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6375)|
| 1:46:17| OK, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6377)|
| 1:46:18| So kind of going back to where I was a while ago, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| still there, we could deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6381)|
| 1:46:25| I would rather, quite frankly, postpone it and let the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6385)|
| 1:46:30| department come back with something that not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6390)|
| 1:46:32| clarifies whatever this is about, plus the self-serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| option, so that we deal with all of this at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6398)|
| 1:46:42| I mean, that's kind of where we're going anyhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| And this is a stopgap moment that I'm not as comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6405)|
| 1:46:51| taking as apparently some others are, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6416)|
| 1:46:58| There is a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6418)|
| 1:47:00| I'm sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| It's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| I think you have one more statement, and I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| hear a statement if that would be fine from the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6426)|
| 1:47:10| I mean, this has been a great debate, and he's got good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| And I'm sorry to ask such a blunt question, because I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| that the boards have delineated between different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| types of alcohols are governed by different types of boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| But are we all saying that if this does pass, that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| actually comfortable with myself just staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| bartenders on the beer taps, but then telling my same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| guests at my establishment, please help yourself to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| mead, ciders, and wines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Will it count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| That's the position that you would be in, in this interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| period of time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| Because another board regulates wine sales, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6469)|
| 1:47:55| legislative body only regulates beer sales, and that's the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| the state has set it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6478)|
| 1:47:59| Sometimes that leads to some illogical approaches, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| that's the setup we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| And again, you know, I want to stress that the board is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| against you folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| What it is is that you're pioneers in this new era, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| so what we're trying to do is to look at this and to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| that our ordinance is what it should be on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| But we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6504)|
| 1:48:25| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6505)|
| 1:48:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6506)|
| 1:48:27| Well, you know, I feel way more comfortable with this process or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6507)|
| 1:48:37| the way they run their business after hearing from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| But I think hearing the possibly the April 1st date, I would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| I feel real confident that we can put this to bed well before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6531)|
| 1:48:52| We should be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| And this council, you know, does want this type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| Not that we don't want these type of businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6537)|
| 1:48:59| I think it goes hand in glove in what we're trying to do here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| And I feel very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| But what I don't feel comfortable about is when the chief of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| police and our law director, all they're asking for is clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| And, you know, I've got to if I want to make a mistake, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| going to be because we are responsible for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6558)|
| 1:49:22| lawsuits or whatever could come from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6562)|
| 1:49:24| But it's not a position that I'm taking that I'm against this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6564)|
| 1:49:28| type of a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6568)|
| 1:49:29| I think it's very well run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6569)|
| 1:49:31| They've been in business for three years and no citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| And that's pretty rare, as we know, in these parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6573)|
| 1:49:38| So, you know, it's a tough situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| It really is tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| And I just don't want them to walk out of here feeling like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| that we're trying to turn them away because I'm certainly not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| And I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| Very well put.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Nick, would you rather postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| Do you feel okay postponing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| I mean, as Finn Barr suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| Well, I would leave that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| We do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| It's a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| The motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| I didn't know that got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6608)|
| 1:50:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6609)|
| 1:50:10| And it's been seconded on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6611)|
| 1:50:12| George?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6612)|
| 1:50:13| I'll make a motion, a substitute motion to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6613)|
| 1:50:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| Do you have a time period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| It's two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6618)|

| 1:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| The motion carries eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| it has been postponed for four weeks and I'm sure that between the law department and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6681)|
| 1:51:34| all of us, we'll work very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| And I hope you folks understand that this has nothing against your business coming to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6700)|
| 1:51:41| We're looking forward to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6701)|
| 1:51:42| So it's just that we'll be able to have clarity to what our Ordinance reads at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6702)|
| 1:51:46| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| Thank you for your patience and good luck and hope you get open before April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6708)|
| 1:51:52| 12C is an ordinance to rezone property located on the northwest side of Richmond Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6712)|
| 1:51:58| northeast of Buick Street from R1A district to RP1 district at a density of up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6718)|
| 1:52:03| dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| Christine Duncan, applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6732)|
| 1:52:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| Oh, I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Okay, we have Councilman Della Bobbi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| I guess it's to Mr. Kelly, who's patiently sitting back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| Is this our first basic pocket neighborhood that we're approving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6746)|
| 1:52:30| We had that issue come up, and then we sent it back for study to all kinds of places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6750)|
| 1:52:35| And I don't have any problem with this particular proposal, but is this sort of the first grouping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6755)|
| 1:52:40| pocket neighborhood that we're about to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6760)|
| 1:52:44| It's an innovative design that they're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| The density is similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| The RP1 that's being requested is similar to what would be permitted in the R1A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| It's just going to be developed in a different form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| And you're going to stay off the hillsides and the places where you wouldn't want development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| That's one of the advantages of the RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| There are existing lots there already that they could build on, but it would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6786)|
| 1:53:12| mass grading in order to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6794)|
| 1:53:15| So this is a smarter placement of the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6795)|
| 1:53:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6797)|
| 1:53:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6804)|
| 1:53:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6807)|
| 1:53:29| Okay, for public forum, we have three people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6809)|
| 1:53:35| First, we have Ms. Talinda Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| If you will come forward and state your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6819)|
| 1:53:43| You'll have five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6823)|
| 1:53:53| Yes, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6833)|
| 1:53:55| My name is Talinda Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| My address is 3120 Woodbine Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6838)|
| 1:54:06| And I thank you for allowing me to come back before you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| I wanted to give you a good report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| I know you get a lot of negativity, but I wanted to say thank you on behalf of the Buffett Trace Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6852)|
| 1:54:22| The last time that I was here, our president of the Homeowners Association was here and our treasurer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6862)|
| 1:54:29| And our concerns were about the waste containers, the new program that you set up with the 95-gallon containers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6869)|
| 1:54:35| Our prime motive at that time was due to aging concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6875)|
| 1:54:42| For myself, being a caregiver of my mother, it said that twice a child, once an adult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6882)|
| 1:54:49| That's not always the case for everyone, but there are challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| And so much like a parent child proves a home, caregivers try to make sure that that environment works well for that aging individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6894)|
| 1:55:04| The other concern was with disabilities, people with disabilities, people with illnesses like congestive heart failure, pulmonary diseases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6904)|
| 1:55:13| Maneuvering a large container was a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| But we want to say thank you because you heard us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| You took the time to listen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| Chad Wythe came to our Homeowners Association after the holidays and talked to us about the plans, gave us better clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6923)|
| 1:55:33| And as we understand it, 15 of the seniors in our community have requested the smaller containers, which is my understanding will be available January 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6933)|
| 1:55:46| So we thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| We also realize that a large portion of this program being successful is that people be proactive with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6948)|
| 1:55:56| In terms of my mother, we have hired a little boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6956)|
| 1:56:00| We've given him his first job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| He's 12 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| And his job will be to come and move that trash container in position correctly so that when Waste Connections comes by, then they can get the trash container.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6964)|
| 1:56:15| But since he is a minor, I also have to be cognizant that he is not in jeopardy of being hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6975)|
| 1:56:24| So we have come to the recognition in that the city has shown all due diligence in that they absolutely do care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6984)|
| 1:56:34| do understand that waste control is another component to make this program successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=6994)|
| 1:56:41| And January 2nd, I wasn't a happy camper because it rained all day and I drove around to see how things were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7001)|
| 1:56:50| and I saw trash lids that were not flipped back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| I've had a fish tank before and I quickly learned that one gallon of liquid is equivalent to 10 pounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7015)|
| 1:57:03| And so if you have a 95-gallon container and the lid's not on it, just think about the weight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| And someone having to come and empty that container, it could kick back from underneath you and it could become a hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7030)|
| 1:57:18| But the city has also listened to that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| And I understand that in the contract that you all signed, that you wrote up, that it's in there, that Waste Connections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7042)|
| 1:57:31| is to make sure that when that can is emptied, that the lid is flipped back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| So we have high hopes and we're trying to be proactive with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| And I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7062)|
| 1:57:45| Thank you so very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| Ms. Thomas, thank you so much for sitting through council and then coming and giving us some congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| You know, you're right, we don't always hear the good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| So we really appreciate that and appreciate your time for coming here and sharing that with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7076)|
| 1:58:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| Is Richard Blair still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7086)|
| 1:58:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| And then we have Robert Buford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| Is Robert here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| There being no other business, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170117?start=7105)|
