| 2:23:23| And as I look at the numbers, as I boil them down, this is really what I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8603)|
| 2:23:28| You have an individual who has invested roughly $5.3 million in the community near and around the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8608)|
| 2:23:37| largely within a half-mile radius, focused on center city programs, around education, around, you know, sports, youth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8617)|
| 2:23:48| community development, mental health, as well as, you know, facilities for women who have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8628)|
| 2:23:58| are struggling via domestic violence, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| I see that as a tremendous community benefit, and that's above and beyond the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| With that, you've got a $50 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8648)|
| 2:24:14| And, you know, that is, you know, obviously land being donated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| You've got $30 million, which is three to four times the median lease payment of any other, you know, team in the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8659)|
| 2:24:31| You've got $13.5 million, which is effectively a down payment on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8671)|
| 2:24:38| And, you know, and a $50 million investment on something this person's not going to own, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8678)|
| 2:24:45| And, you know, if that doesn't show a commitment, and if that is not reflective of really a true love affair with this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8685)|
| 2:24:56| then I'm not really sure what else is, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8696)|
| 2:25:00| And, you know, it's a $90 million investment with, you know, I'm including the land donation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8700)|
| 2:25:07| with a return on investment of roughly $480 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| That includes an increased tax base, which is of monumental proportions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8712)|
| 2:25:19| It's game changing, quite frankly, no pun intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| But, you know, I'm a believer in public-private partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| I feel like they're the gold standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8727)|
| 2:25:29| I feel like they're a win-win, and I think the rewards are longstanding, are significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8729)|
| 2:25:37| And I really just commend everybody, members of both administrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8737)|
| 2:25:43| everybody who has put their heart and soul into trying to bring this together and make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8743)|
| 2:25:50| And, you know, I don't really know how much more that we can ask an individual to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8750)|
| 2:25:58| And I think to prove, I think with the partnerships that we've seen with the Knoxville Area Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| with Tuskegee Next, again, it's very much a 360-degree effort in making this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8764)|
| 2:26:15| And, you know, at the end of the day, I really say that the biggest risk is no risk at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8775)|
| 2:26:20| But I just really commend everybody who has worked tirelessly to make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8780)|
| 2:26:27| This is no easy feat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8787)|
| 2:26:29| I think the workshops have been great. The dialogue has been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8789)|
| 2:26:32| But I just, I do, I say get off G and move to O.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8792)|
| 2:26:38| And I think this is a great investment for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8798)|
| 2:26:45| Thank you, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| So as I look around the dais, I don't at this point see any lights on for members who have not yet spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8809)|
| 2:26:57| We do have three members at this point that would like to ask follow-up questions or perhaps make follow-up comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8817)|
| 2:27:05| I do want to encourage my colleagues and council members as we do that to please limit your follow-up to a couple of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8825)|
| 2:27:14| and keep your remarks as concise as possible so we can move to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| And then on to the conclusion of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8839)|
| 2:27:21| I think we've all been part of marathon meetings before, and they tend to get less productive as they go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| So we don't want to run into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| So I will begin follow-ups now with Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8848)|
| 2:27:35| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8855)|
| 2:27:36| And I just want to say before I begin my remarks that I have found this process really unfortunate and a disservice to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8856)|
| 2:27:50| And on top of all of that, these short workshops where I'm not able to ask all of the questions that I have has been unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8870)|
| 2:28:00| I believe the project overall poses a lot of risk, and those are not necessarily financial risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8880)|
| 2:28:09| We have not done our due diligence as a city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| We have not done a community impact study to see what the impact is going to be on the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8891)|
| 2:28:20| to see what the impact is going to be on quality of life for those who live around this proposed stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8900)|
| 2:28:28| when there's been no additional parking proposed and other issues that are going to come up with this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8908)|
| 2:28:37| So it saddens me because I know that as a city, we have to prepare ourselves now to deal with the negative outcomes that are soon to come from this stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8917)|
| 2:28:51| I'm also disappointed because each time we meet, it's an opportunity for County Commission and City Council to come together and to ask tough questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8931)|
| 2:29:02| so that we can really truly understand this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8942)|
| 2:29:05| And I heard so many softball questions tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8945)|
| 2:29:09| It's so sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8949)|
| 2:29:11| So I'll go back to my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8951)|
| 2:29:15| I mean, Knoxville looks like a done deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8955)|
| 2:29:17| These folks are not even asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8957)|
| 2:29:20| This development agreement, when I look at the development agreement and lease agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8960)|
| 2:29:23| there are things that conflict with each other in the two agreements, and I have major concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8963)|
| 2:29:31| One that I mentioned earlier is the timeline for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8971)|
| 2:29:37| Moving to the next part of the timeline, it states in the development agreement that the bonds have to be issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8977)|
| 2:29:46| and money available to the sports authority by the end of February 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8986)|
| 2:29:52| That's three months, four months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8992)|
| 2:29:57| But what I'm being told is there's so much more that needs to be done before that step will be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8997)|
| 2:30:04| But our own development agreement presented towards us says that has to happen in the next four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9004)|
| 2:30:12| So there are a few things that I have questions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| When we meet first at our city council meeting next week, I'm going to propose that we postpone this agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9017)|
| 2:30:25| because there's a lot more that we need to go over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9025)|
| 2:30:29| We need more details about the public infrastructure agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9029)|
| 2:30:37| Tonight's the first night we're hearing estimates of what those costs may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9037)|
| 2:30:42| In my opinion, that should be in place before we're signing an interlocal agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| Let's see. There's also I want more details about the obligations of KUV under this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9048)|
| 2:31:01| Maybe a separate entity from city council, but I have to do my due diligence to ensure that I'm not authorizing projects to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9061)|
| 2:31:08| that obligate KUV ratepayers, who are our constituents, to have to cover those costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9068)|
| 2:31:16| especially when we've taken steps to bring broadband and start a new utility service here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9076)|
| 2:31:27| We have to think about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9087)|
| 2:31:30| The other thing that stood out to me was now I've got things all discombobulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9090)|
| 2:31:41| There's a series of agreements that need to be approved in order for this work to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9101)|
| 2:31:48| Interlocal should not be the first agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| Signing over authority to the sports authority to issue bonds, to sign this development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9112)|
| 2:32:00| which gives the developer the authority to enter into contracts without public review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9120)|
| 2:32:07| without sports authority approval, is not wise and is not doing our due diligence for our constituent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9127)|
| 2:32:20| I'm also concerned that there are multiple sections in here that allow the developer to remove himself from this agreement with little to no penalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9140)|
| 2:32:40| Here, I really have tossed these around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9160)|
| 2:32:47| I think it's 5.1.1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9167)|
| 2:32:51| It states that the authority may request in order to determine that the authority is receiving the lowest cost for the construction of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9171)|
| 2:33:06| If we are, as a city council and as a county commission, highlighting priorities for this project to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9186)|
| 2:33:17| and that certain community benefits must be prioritized in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| that means that's not necessarily going to be the lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| Major corporations are able to offer a lower bid than small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9208)|
| 2:33:33| These are things that we have to think about ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9213)|
| 2:33:36| It says if the developer and authority are not able to successfully reduce the cost of the stadium improvements in a manner that's acceptable to both parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9216)|
| 2:33:46| either party may terminate this agreement and have no further obligations under it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9226)|
| 2:33:53| That's just mind-boggling to me that that statement would be in this agreement not taking into account the bonds being issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9233)|
| 2:34:06| how much has been spent towards the project thus far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| and this gives R&R, Boyd, the ability to walk away if the sports authority decides to go with a bid from a minority contractor that impacts the overall cost of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9250)|
| 2:34:25| That's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9265)|
| 2:34:29| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9269)|
| 2:34:38| I did have a question about the ability of the developer to enter into contracts without authority approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9278)|
| 2:34:45| I do not see anything written here that would limit the size of those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9285)|
| 2:34:50| Is it a contract of any size that the developer can enter into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| That's 14.2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9295)|
| 2:35:08| I'm sorry. Are you referring to the lease or the development agreement right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9308)|
| 2:35:12| Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9312)|
| 2:35:13| Development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| So they are the turnkey developers, so they will hire a construction manager who will bid out all the major subcontracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9314)|
| 2:35:25| and the sports authority has hired a construction consultant to make sure the process is fair and transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9325)|
| 2:35:34| I mean, yes, is the quick answer to your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9334)|
| 2:35:37| I mean, that's what the largest subcontracts will be hired through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9337)|
| 2:35:46| And then in Section 6.5, the cost overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9346)|
| 2:35:53| It's similar to the question Councilmember Roberto asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9353)|
| 2:35:59| but I'm very concerned that once KUB initiates any utility work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9359)|
| 2:36:06| there could be additional environmental concerns that need to be remediated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9366)|
| 2:36:11| if the developer has not thoroughly investigated the site for any potential concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9371)|
| 2:36:21| down to the level of utilities because they're not responsible for utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9381)|
| 2:36:26| I don't know how we clarify that within this agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| but it seems like there's a lot of room for the developer to not be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9389)|
| 2:36:35| for any potential discoveries that come once if KUB pursues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| if KUB moves forward with their utility work for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| Do we have any protections in our agreement that would not leave KUB on the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9405)|
| 2:36:57| for any environmental concerns at this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9417)|
| 2:37:04| So a thorough site assessment is part of the due diligence process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9424)|
| 2:37:08| I would have to lean on some of our engineering consultants who are in the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9428)|
| 2:37:13| to be able to answer your question to a full degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9433)|
| 2:37:16| but I will tell you, Councilmember Parker, that a full site assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| including environmental conditions, is part of the due diligence process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9441)|
| 2:37:25| and identifying those environmental conditions that need to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9445)|
| 2:37:30| are all part of the costs that have been estimated thus far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9450)|
| 2:37:37| and will continue to be refined, particularly as it relates to infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9457)|
| 2:37:44| Okay. We'll try to get some more clarification at next week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9464)|
| 2:37:52| I did want to address the community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| What we have before us is not a community benefits agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| and I actually appreciate the letter that was passed around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9479)|
| 2:38:02| because it states clearly a community benefits agreement is not needed in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9482)|
| 2:38:10| I'm sorry. I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9490)|
| 2:38:12| I mean, we need to ensure that the verbal promises being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9492)|
| 2:38:20| are a part of this project, not today, not a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9500)|
| 2:38:26| but through the full 30 years of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9506)|
| 2:38:29| And a lot can happen in 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9509)|
| 2:38:31| and that's why we need legal agreement between the two private entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9511)|
| 2:38:38| so that can move forward even if, God forbid, Randy Boyd dropped dead tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| Randy Boyd may like Knoxville. His predecessor may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9524)|
| 2:38:47| And so we need legally binding agreements, not just for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| And, again, the development agreement includes language that the developer should take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9533)|
| 2:39:01| make a good-faith effort to include diverse contractors on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9541)|
| 2:39:07| That is a requirement for any project that receives $1 from it of public money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9547)|
| 2:39:16| This is much more significant public investment than even a TIFR pilot for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9556)|
| 2:39:24| And so it is reasonable that the community would want more than just a good-faith effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9564)|
| 2:39:32| that's generally required in these types of agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9572)|
| 2:39:36| And as has been mentioned, because the sports authority has its own purchasing process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9576)|
| 2:39:42| and as we can see, the developer will be heavily engaged in the contracting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9582)|
| 2:39:49| they're able to set numerical goals for how many minority-owned, disadvantaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9589)|
| 2:39:59| you know, whatever term you want to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9599)|
| 2:40:02| they're able to make numerical goals for this project and work towards meeting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9602)|
| 2:40:08| And the best way to meet those goals is to work with trained, qualified, informed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9608)|
| 2:40:17| established apprenticeships programs that will actually lead to a future career for someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9617)|
| 2:40:25| An internship program is great, but that is not going to lead to future employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9625)|
| 2:40:32| immediately as an apprenticeship program would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9632)|
| 2:40:35| And so why, if we have local labor organizations who have come to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9635)|
| 2:40:42| hey, we have an apprenticeship program, and we'll pay for the apprenticeship program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9642)|
| 2:40:48| let us be involved because we think that we can play an important role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9648)|
| 2:40:52| that will ensure that these are local jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| Why would we not take them up on that offer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| Why would we try to start a new program through the Urban League?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9659)|
| 2:41:04| That doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9664)|
| 2:41:07| I don't think that we should miss out on these opportunities to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| And of course, since I've publicly stated this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9672)|
| 2:41:19| the only way we're going to get it right, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| is if there are true community benefits with a signed, legally binding agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9682)|
| 2:41:29| We're clear about the impacts on our community, especially East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9689)|
| 2:41:34| Right now we're just using East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| We're just saying this is going to be great for East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9697)|
| 2:41:40| But we've done no community impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| and we're not thinking about the long-term impacts on that community, and that concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9702)|
| 2:41:48| And then finally, I just hope that folks will spend some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9708)|
| 2:42:01| reading the development agreement, reading the lease agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9721)|
| 2:42:06| and realizing that we have the ability now to demand and ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9726)|
| 2:42:14| that a project that truly benefits our community is what moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9734)|
| 2:42:21| We should not compromise away what our communities really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| because we feel like the project won't work without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9747)|
| 2:42:30| I just don't believe that to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| If this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9753)|
| 2:42:36| then let's get what our community needs out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| $3 million in philanthropy, I'm sorry, I'm not impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9759)|
| 2:42:43| I'm not impressed by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| That is not a community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| We should not award businessmen by building them buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9767)|
| 2:42:55| because they're philanthropists in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| That's not what our role is as a government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| That's absolutely not our role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9781)|
| 2:43:03| So I'll leave it there, because I can feel folks getting antsy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| and we'll hopefully continue this conversation next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9787)|
| 2:43:11| and hopefully folks will be in support of postponing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9791)|
| 2:43:15| until we get more information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9795)|
| 2:43:17| and that folks will not approve this interlocal agreement moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| until there is a signed community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9803)|
| 2:43:28| with real guarantees in it for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9812)|
| 2:43:36| Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9816)|
| 2:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9818)|
| 2:43:40| That's a lot to follow up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| I'm going to keep mine brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| I just want to talk about one of the things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9825)|
| 2:43:48| the thing that all of the plans that the Urban League have are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9833)|
| 2:43:54| There's a lot of intention put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9834)|
| 2:43:56| We're talking about $80 million of the city or the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9836)|
| 2:44:02| and then another $100 million of private development, more than that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9842)|
| 2:44:06| the infrastructure costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9846)|
| 2:44:08| We're like at more than $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| There's space to take care of more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9851)|
| 2:44:13| It's not a competition if we do what the Urban League is recommending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9853)|
| 2:44:18| which is very necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9858)|
| 2:44:21| working with communities that have been taken advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| and disregarded for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9864)|
| 2:44:27| But there is space for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| This is millions and millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| It's not a competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9871)|
| 2:44:34| This is one of the largest projects since the World's Fair site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9874)|
| 2:44:37| It's a big deal, and I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9877)|
| 2:44:40| But as we've all been saying, the devil's in the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| That's all I'm worried about is I want the details to be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9883)|
| 2:44:47| This isn't a you disagree with me and it's an up or down kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9887)|
| 2:44:52| These are the details we need to spend time on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| And I'm on board for a postponement because there are a lot of details here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9895)|
| 2:44:59| Some of these things I got just this afternoon before the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9899)|
| 2:45:03| but I'd like to have time to digest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9903)|
| 2:45:07| But I'd like to challenge us to try to get more creative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9907)|
| 2:45:11| with how this can benefit the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| Thinking as a single mother who, you know, when I had to go to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9914)|
| 2:45:19| if it wasn't for my parents, I would not have been able to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| a lot of the things that I wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9922)|
| 2:45:25| A lot of women cannot join the workforce because there's not child care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9925)|
| 2:45:29| Maybe we can provide child care for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9929)|
| 2:45:31| The employees, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9931)|
| 2:45:33| I mean, it's a big part of it with the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9933)|
| 2:45:36| but this is going to go on for 30-plus years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| To make statements like the employees that come in afterwards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9939)|
| 2:45:44| you know, the janitors, the popcorn vendors, the bartenders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9944)|
| 2:45:48| yeah, these might be some part-time jobs for students and for retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9948)|
| 2:45:54| That doesn't mean this is extra spending money for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9954)|
| 2:45:57| The University of Tennessee has a food pantry for its students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9957)|
| 2:46:03| because they cannot afford their groceries when they go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9963)|
| 2:46:07| So it's not that a student with a part-time job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| it doesn't matter what they make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| Retirees work because their Social Security isn't covering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9972)|
| 2:46:17| So I found that very disingenuous to feel like the part-time jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9977)|
| 2:46:22| that come afterwards are just hobbies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9982)|
| 2:46:29| So I'd like to challenge us on how we give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9989)|
| 2:46:34| I think there are a lot of good things that can come of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9994)|
| 2:46:37| We need to work a little bit harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9997)|
| 2:46:39| This is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=9999)|
| 2:46:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10001)|
| 2:46:44| Thank you, Councilmember Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I'll call on Councilmember Roberto for the final follow-up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10006)|
| 2:46:49| and then we will move into the public forum section of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10009)|
| 2:46:52| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10012)|
| 2:46:56| There's been a lot of change in baseball over the last few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10016)|
| 2:47:01| and in particular with stadium standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10021)|
| 2:47:03| So I wanted to briefly touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10023)|
| 2:47:08| Obviously, I would assume, and I'll ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| that when the stadium is built, if it was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| it would be built to the standards that Major League Baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10035)|
| 2:47:18| has set forth right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| My question is, what happens in the future if those standards change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| Who is responsible for making sure that the updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10044)|
| 2:47:27| whatever updates might be required in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| are going to be taken care of in construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10050)|
| 2:47:40| Let me respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10060)|
| 2:47:44| One of the definitions of capital improvements includes a laundry list of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10064)|
| 2:47:50| including any changes that may be required to be made to meet MLB standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10070)|
| 2:47:55| That's an issue that we've been negotiating extensively over the last few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10075)|
| 2:48:00| What the draft presently says is that if, I think it's Commissioner Smith's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10080)|
| 2:48:07| if it's something that can be managed within the capital improvements budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10087)|
| 2:48:11| and is good for the overall benefit of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| that it's something that would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10093)|
| 2:48:15| If it's something really just to benefit baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| that doesn't benefit the overall use of the stadium for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| that that would be an expense that the tenant would need to bear if they want to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10102)|
| 2:48:27| We all have to realize, though, that theoretically MLB could pull the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| if eventually the stadium was not kept up to their standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10111)|
| 2:48:38| Does this stadium have other uses possibly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10118)|
| 2:48:41| Not possibly, would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10121)|
| 2:48:42| This essentially will be our public amphitheater for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| and if we lost baseball and we're not able to replace it with an independent team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10125)|
| 2:48:49| we're obviously going to hopefully have soccer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10129)|
| 2:48:51| You guys are certainly a soccer fan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| I believe that will grow, but there are other uses for the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| that if that eventuality ever happened, and they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10136)|
| 2:49:01| But, yes, I'd be glad to walk you through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10141)|
| 2:49:04| You've got to walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| A lot of Councilman Parker's questions are very good questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| and I'm glad to spend as much time as you all like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10148)|
| 2:49:10| I think it's really important to recognize that these documents would not be signed for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10150)|
| 2:49:17| We will be going through, looking forward to getting any detailed comments any of you all would like to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10157)|
| 2:49:23| and to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10163)|
| 2:49:24| But you have to go through a number of sections to follow through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10164)|
| 2:49:26| and I'd be glad to do that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| But essentially, I hate to put it simply, it's on them, the cost of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10168)|
| 2:49:33| if it does not overall benefit for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10176)|
| 2:49:37| And then, I don't know who can answer this, maybe Mr. Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10177)|
| 2:49:40| and maybe somebody with the baseball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| but how long is the Smokies' license agreement with Major League Baseball good for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10182)|
| 2:49:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10193)|
| 2:49:54| The agreement that we have now is for ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10194)|
| 2:49:58| and it's consistent with what we've had with the National Association in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| but now it's directly with the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| Thank you, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10208)|
| 2:50:10| We will now move into the public forum section of our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10210)|
| 2:50:14| We have 12 individuals who have signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10214)|
| 2:50:19| Consistent with our published agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10219)|
| 2:50:21| each speaker will be allowed up to three minutes to address this joint workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10221)|
| 2:50:25| so our IT folks have put a timer up on the screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10225)|
| 2:50:29| so when I call your name, if you'll please come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| I'll ask you to state your name and your county of residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| and we'll have three minutes to address the joint workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10236)|
| 2:50:39| Tyler Givens is our first speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10239)|
| 2:50:46| Next will be Andres Lorenzo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10246)|
| 2:50:49| Mr. Givens, if you'll state your name and county of residence, you have three minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10249)|
| 2:50:52| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10252)|
| 2:50:53| My name is Tyler Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10253)|
| 2:50:54| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10254)|
| 2:50:56| A couple of the commissioners and council members tonight have done a fantastic job asking great questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10256)|
| 2:51:04| about some details of the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10264)|
| 2:51:06| but I wanted to rebut a handful of the remarks we heard from Mr. Boyd at the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10266)|
| 2:51:11| and his team throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10271)|
| 2:51:13| Mr. Boyd continues to tout fantastic concerts, which we already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10273)|
| 2:51:17| and a farmer's market, which we already have, as benefits of his stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| He also tried to convince us that the $4 million he spent for cleaning up the site makes it worth $14 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10281)|
| 2:51:26| Let's talk a little bit about how much his fantasy land is worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10286)|
| 2:51:30| In 2003, the property was valued at $450,000 in bankruptcy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| In 2016, RR Land bought the property for $10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10294)|
| 2:51:41| It was then revalued at $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| In 2021, we are hearing that the value of the stadium is now stadium land that has nothing developed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10304)|
| 2:51:50| It's only been slightly cleared, or it's been cleared, I guess it's shovel-ready, but that's his $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10310)|
| 2:51:54| Now we're being told the land is worth $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10314)|
| 2:51:56| and he also wanted us to add the $4 million on top of that valuation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10316)|
| 2:52:00| I apologize, my point got a little bit muddy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| The point is, in 2016, he paid $10 for the property, and now he's going to get a big tax break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10322)|
| 2:52:08| I'm happy to provide all of the real estate information on that to your email addresses afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10328)|
| 2:52:14| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=10334)|

| 3:03:29| We can have markets, which we already do some of that on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11009)|
| 3:03:32| but there's so much more opportunity if we have a place that is not going to require us to shut down the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11012)|
| 3:03:39| Just what it will do for tourism, local and from afar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11019)|

| 3:04:08| and all of this hope and excitement has gone into the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11048)|
| 3:04:13| and then to have that removed, what that might do to the interest and atmosphere in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11053)|
| 3:04:24| I think it's a scary thought to think of what could happen to a piece of land like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11064)|
| 3:04:29| We don't have an opportunity like this often where we have a private individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11069)|

| 3:05:22| A little bit about the Downtown Knoxville Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| I don't know if you all are that familiar with what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| but we were formed in 1993 to do some things that the city council couldn't do as a central business improvement district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11128)|
| 3:05:36| And so we make improvements, enhance services and promote downtown specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11136)|
| 3:05:42| Examples of what we've done since 1993 include a lot of facade grants in our historic buildings downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11142)|
| 3:05:49| The flower planters that you see on the sidewalks downtown, the flowers that hang in Market Square during this last winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11149)|
| 3:05:57| The lights that hung in the Grove both during the winter and through the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11157)|
| 3:06:03| And then we also do some more practical things like hire more security for downtown between Thursdays and Sundays in our entertainment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11163)|
| 3:06:10| And so we do all this to support our mission, which is to attract and retain a thriving community of residents, businesses and visitors in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11170)|
| 3:06:22| And that's why we support the stadium and the projects that will be surrounding the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| Because we believe it will help us continue to build a thriving community of downtown residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| We believe the stadium will support our local restaurants, our local bars and our local retail shops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| And we believe the stadium will attract visitors to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11196)|
| 3:06:39| My personal opinion at the end of this is that if the stadium is to be a blessing for Knoxville, it must create community for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11199)|

| 3:08:05| Once again, these are things that we do and we're in the community and we want to be more involved in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11285)|

| 3:08:15| So, in the end, we're looking for something in writing, right, because, again, we can promise everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11295)|

| 3:08:22| But we have an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| When our contractors hire through us, we have a wage scale that the apprentices are going to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11304)|
| 3:08:28| We know this is the apprentice's rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11308)|

| 3:08:33| And then there's, for ironworkers, it's a three-year program with six periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11313)|
| 3:08:37| You start out first period, you're roughly almost $16 an hour, all the way up to $22 an hour with health care, pension, annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11317)|

| 3:08:48| These are going to make these kids into a career, something they can offer them, something they can buy the tickets for to go to the game and afford that $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11328)|

| 3:09:04| I'd hate for it to be that college student who says, you know, part-time job, a hobby, working at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11344)|

| 3:09:13| So these are things that we want in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| And it's awesome that they have the intentions of paying them competitive wages in the community or local hire, but where's the guarantee of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11355)|

| 3:11:01| Does the benefits agreement we've heard about tonight, does it include 40% local hire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11461)|
| 3:11:09| Is that contractor that's going to build this development, are they going to bring their workers in from Michigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| Or are we going to let workers right here do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11476)|
| 3:11:20| Are they going to bring their apprentices in from Michigan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11480)|

| 3:12:35| We need a community benefits agreement that benefits the folks of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11555)|

| 3:13:19| We already have the established programs and the training set up for programs like what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11599)|

| 3:14:15| And that's what labor unions do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11655)|

| 3:14:28| And that's really all we're saying is we have all these great things that I think that we've heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11668)|

| 3:14:41| If we all agree on these things and we all have the same interest here, then let's just put it in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=11681)|
