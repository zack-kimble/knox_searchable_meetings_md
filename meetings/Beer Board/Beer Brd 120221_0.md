| 0:01:39| Councilman Grieve, if you're so inclined, I'd like you to make the motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| or disapprove or whatever we're going to do, since this is in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=103)|

| 0:02:29| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration, the corporate charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| and approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=153)|

| 0:02:40| Yes, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| I just was keeping my fingers crossed that I would have those before, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=161)|
| 0:02:45| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| I just received word from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=167)|
| 0:02:50| I applied for everything on the 10th of February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| and it is now finished being sent out UPS tomorrow for my receipt on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=172)|
| 0:02:58| and that's the state tax information as well as my LLC charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Thank you, and Ms. Martin will take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=183)|

| 0:03:08| I move that we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=197)|

| 0:03:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| The next one is Cassie's Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| And, Councilman Grieve, you really have a ton of these tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| You've been busy recruiting new businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=206)|
| 0:03:28| It's a hard-drinking district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| I prefer to think of it as a party district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=214)|

| 0:03:36| Very sociable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=216)|

| 0:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Jim Cornett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| My name is Jim Cornett, 2099 Thunderhead Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Do we have a record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Before we hear a motion, do you want to tell us about Cassie's Grill and where it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| It's Cassie's Corner Grill on Thunderhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=240)|
| 0:04:02| It's actually the corner of Thunderhead Road and North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| It faces primarily North Shore, but the access is from Thunderhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| It's just past Pellissippi on North Shore where the new Target and Publix development is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=248)|
| 0:04:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| We have lots of new neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| I'm sorry, Mr. Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| Thank you, Chairman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Just a question on this, the distances from churches and schools, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=266)|
| 0:04:32| There was no mention of the new Southwest Elementary, which is not there yet, but it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=272)|
| 0:04:38| Was that issue even considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=278)|
| 0:04:41| Mr. Frost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=281)|
| 0:04:42| Because there's no building there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=282)|
| 0:04:46| So what happens when a school moves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| I don't think it's going to be an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| I think it's far in excess of 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| I think it's like 5,000 feet is what I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| At this time, there isn't, if I correct, Mr. Frost, that there isn't a building, so there's no place to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| Does that satisfy you, Mr. Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| I'd like to make a motion that we approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=317)|

| 0:05:23| The next is Club Exile, Aaron Ellison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=323)|
| 0:05:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=334)|
| 0:05:35| My name is Aaron Ellison, address 11104 Samley Road, Knoxville, 37932, residential address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=335)|
| 0:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=345)|
| 0:05:47| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| Mr. James Fell, listed on the application as manager, has a conviction, according to city court, of days and hours of retail sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Ms. Martin, has there been anything that occurred that might have impacted that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| Ms. Day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=363)|
| 0:06:06| The manager has been removed from the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| I will be owner and manager now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| Mr. Frost, does that take care of the situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| If someone has not been convicted of these, is not on the application, there shouldn't be an issue on that aspect of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=376)|
| 0:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=384)|
| 0:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| Is the file complete, near complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| We're waiting on approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=389)|

| 0:06:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=396)|
| 0:06:37| I want to make sure now that he is the manager and the owner, and it's on the application that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=397)|
| 0:06:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=402)|

| 0:06:55| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| Could you tell us anything about Club Exile?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Club Exile is just a low-key alternative club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| It's been there for 12, 15 years under a different ownership, different name, in the same area, same type club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=422)|
| 0:07:11| It's just a low-key alternative club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=431)|

| 0:07:25| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| I'm Lisa Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| I reside at 8119 Greenwell Road, Knoxville, 37938.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| Sergeant Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=452)|
| 0:07:33| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=456)|
| 0:07:37| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| Any final documentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Just on the safe side, my name is listed here on the Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Should I need to make that known?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| Would that be any sort of problem for me voting on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=475)|
| 0:07:58| You're not receiving any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| I'm not receiving anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| He's a volunteer board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I think your disclosure is adequate enough, and go ahead and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you, though, for raising that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| Did we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Tell us, before you go away, since you've got everything complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| when this permit will be used for this one-day event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=502)|
| 0:08:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| It is a one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| I'm sorry, one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| I was going to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=510)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| We're going to particularly use it for Market Square Art Fair weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| April 13th through 15th, where we're adding culinary arts to that event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| and also at Rhythm and Bloom's Music Festival the following weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| April 20th through 22nd, and also after the Dogwood Parade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| and Dogwood Mile for a party on the square on April 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| Thank you for the city's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| Next on our list is Ichiban Japanese Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| It's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Apparently Miss Day and I are going to have to take a trip to New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| to find the owners to find out about this because they don't seem to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| So I'm going to ask that we postpone this until the next beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| and if they're not here, then I may have another recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Is this the one that was deferred from January 24th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| And I'm not happy about this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| What's the date of the letter that we received?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| We'll find out in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=591)|
| 0:09:54| You know, again, we've talked about this before, that this is now where, of course, we're in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=594)|
| 0:09:59| but, you know, you say you can't even find the person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| And there's been no communication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| Other than the letters that appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| If we could find when this letter was sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| You know, again, this goes against what some of us have talked about in terms of how often are we going to defer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| and if we defer, does the person come and ask us when's the letter and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=617)|
| 0:10:23| We have a letter that's not dated, but it was faxed to us late last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| Late last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| The fax had to be time stamped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=631)|
| 0:10:34| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| That's why they're looking for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=638)|
| 0:10:42| Since this is in my district, my thinking was that if it was the will of this board to give them another 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| I will write a letter with Ms. Mitchell's help telling them that if they don't have this together by the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| that it will be over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| Would that satisfy you, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| So do I have a motion to postpone until the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=661)|
| 0:11:05| Move to postpone until the next board second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=665)|
| 0:11:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=670)|
| 0:11:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| The next is Morricone's Pizzeria and Grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=673)|
| 0:11:16| This is in Councilman Pavlis' district, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| I'm sorry, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| This must be my night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| My name is Greg Lauer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| It's 2319 Smith School Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Any record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| What about the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=702)|
| 0:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| One of the things that was noted is that this is within 300 feet of Tyson House,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| which is an outreach Episcopalian and Lutheran student location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| And we have a letter from Tyson House that they have no objection to this business getting the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=718)|
| 0:12:07| Does that satisfy you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| I'm wondering what our council would say as to whether we can suspend that rule or make that exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=730)|
| 0:12:16| Well, I had noticed that there was a distance issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| and Chairman Palmer and I have been corresponding and talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=739)|
| 0:12:23| This location has had beer permits in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| The former occupant tenant did not have, and they have been given in the past for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=749)|
| 0:12:38| So it's more than a year has lapsed from the last beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| There was actually an issue some 14 or 15 years ago that I recalled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| and I contacted the attorney who was involved at the time and talked about how that got worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| And since that time, Tyson House had given permission or said they did not object to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=774)|
| 0:13:03| and that's been accepted in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Yeah, I mean, it's in my district, and I'd like to see this work, but, I mean, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| I mean, a letter from a business, I mean, we've got the law of the land, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=794)|
| 0:13:21| So you're saying that, I mean, it'd have to be preexisting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Well, I guess the issue is, in part, is this a church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| It's my understanding that, you know, they don't have church bulletins and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| It's not clearly defined as a church under the city ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=818)|
| 0:13:46| So instead of them making an issue of it, they're going ahead and saying we're not going to contest it on that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=826)|
| 0:13:56| because the definition of the church, if it applies to Tyson House, has never been resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| I mean, I was chairing the beer board when this happened back when, and I remember it was a big fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=843)|
| 0:14:09| But this is not considered a place, a house of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| But a letter, I mean, I think we need clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Just, you know, for future, just because somebody is approving it would not make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| I spoke with the chaplain for Tudor House yesterday and a couple times over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| and he had met with the Episcopal and the Lutheran leadership on this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=872)|
| 0:14:40| And he was comfortable that they were comfortable, and that was the reason why the letter came from him today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=880)|
| 0:14:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| I'll move to approve subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| I was just going to follow up on his question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| I understood his question to be, is that legally permissible for us to accept that as a reasonable waiver of this requirement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=895)|
| 0:15:04| Oh, you know, the beer board would like, you know, we could postpone this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| I could do a couple of, you know, do some research, you know, on the issue as it applies to Tyson House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=908)|
| 0:15:17| No, I mean, if it's not considered a house of worship, I don't think it's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| My whole point is somebody can't just write a letter and say, we think it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| I just want clarity on that moving forward, because that could really become a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| Well, yeah, the issue is, you know, it doesn't sound like Tyson House is going to meet the definition of a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=931)|
| 0:15:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| And that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| And that's different than you're saying, which is, I'm a church, but I like liquor, so let them come on in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| Or any establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| A funeral home or something, a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Because, yeah, once the permit is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| I don't mean to scare you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| Just we're getting clarity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| I agree with Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=955)|
| 0:15:57| Once the permit's granted, you know, a subsequent neighboring property owner might object, but at that point it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| So I didn't speak clearly enough, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=963)|
| 0:16:08| And when I did speak with the chaplain, he did point out that Martin Luther was a beer maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| So that's another reason, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=973)|
| 0:16:16| Anyway, so you have moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| And do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| Next second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=979)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Now that we've put you through the inquisition, would you tell us a little bit about Morricone's Pizzeria and Grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| Luther's back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| We're a Chicago-style pizza and grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=989)|
| 0:16:32| So we'll be offering basically sandwiches, that type of thing, from the Chicagoland area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Deep dish, the real deep dish pizza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Actually, we're doing a thin crust one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| We don't do the deep dish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| I've got to know if he has Italian beef, because that happens in Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| All of our products are Vienna products that come from Chicago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| So it will be a true Chicago product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1016)|
| 0:16:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Do you need to see them, Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| The next one is in Councilman Pavlis' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| It's Knoxon Lounge, and they have withdrawn their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1030)|
| 0:17:13| Is that correct, Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I guess it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| They haven't conferred with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| Is there a stamp?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| We need to have a motion to approve the withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Yes, there's a letter in our packet here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1050)|
| 0:17:32| When I got here late, I didn't see the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| But if that's the case, I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1054)|
| 0:17:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| And I did speak with Mr. Ho yesterday about this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| The next is Preservation Pub, and it should be Paula McAuley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1066)|
| 0:17:54| This is two one-day permits, St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1074)|
| 0:17:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| Paula McAnally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| I reside at 7208 Broken Creek Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| Any record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Do you want to tell us about your St. Patrick's Day and Cinco de Mayo events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Essentially, they're one-day square events similar to, like, the Dogwood Festival that was mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| The square will be closed at either end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| One is going to be held on St. Patty's Day, and the other will be on Cinco de Mayo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| which are both Saturdays this year, which landed nicely on the calendar, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| So we decided to take advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| Anybody that has a business on the square is invited to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| and we've sent out letters stating so and meetings for them to come to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| and we'll have necessary, you know, insurance and security and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| But it will allow free flow from businesses out onto the square, and that will include beer going in now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| Vice Mayor Powles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| It's the old line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| Councilman De La Vogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| I was going to go ahead and move for approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| but I wanted to thank the lady for one of the signs in their premises which says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| there's a lot of wisdom in a pint, less in a quart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| I think that's good advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Knowing to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| We appreciate that observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1153)|
| 0:19:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| The next is Raceway 6757 on Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1165)|
| 0:19:30| I think Amanda Martin is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1170)|
| 0:19:34| I'm not so good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| My name is Areej Abuhilwe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| I own Raceway 6757, 4418 Western Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1181)|
| 0:19:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| Any record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| What about the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| We just need surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| Do you have that with you tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Oh, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| I see in the back that indicates there's a monetary school within 257 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| but it has, I guess, since it was a preexisting business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| it has the right to continue the activity is my understanding, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| And it's, excuse me, it's off-premise sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Oh, it's off-premise sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1225)|

| 0:20:56| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| What about the documents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration and approval from the building inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| and surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1267)|
| 0:21:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1269)|

| 0:21:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| If you want to see Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Now we come to the adding to the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| and this is just one more bar and grill on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| and this should be Mr. Weed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1287)|
| 0:21:29| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Robert Weed, 9355 Kingston Pike Suite 5, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1290)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| And you have received approval previously pending final documentation in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| This is now February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| Tell us what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| Well, we had about a month's wait on all of our permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| trying to get a grease trap and everything else put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| Construction is about two weeks away from being finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| So you think in two weeks you'll be ready to open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| I'm hoping next week we'll have all our inspections complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| but I'd like an extra week just to be on the safe side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Do we need a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| Do we have a motion to extend for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1332)|
| 0:22:15| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1337)|
| 0:22:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| The next part of our agenda has to do with administrative beer hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| and I think Ms. Mitchell sent out a pretty good explanation for how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| These people whose names are on this administrative beer hearing have had their second citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1355)|
| 0:22:41| and I think we have in our packets the first plan they submitted with the first citation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| that went to the police department, and then now they have submitted an additional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1366)|
| 0:22:51| The first group is Buffalo Wild Wings Grill and Bar on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| They have paid their fine, but they have also closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| So we need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| We need nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Oh, thank you for your check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| They've totally closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1386)|
| 0:23:07| Yes, the place is totally closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| They have one other Buffalo Wild Wings, and that's in Turkey Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| but the manager is in West Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| The second administrative hearing is Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Let's think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| So the other one is within the city boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| The city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| It would have been nice for them to have been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| I thought so, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| It's still the same management company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Well, I asked about that because I thought it would be good for them to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| but I was told that since this one is closed and that's where the violation occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| the fine had been paid, there would be no remedial plan for this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1434)|
| 0:23:59| because this might not be a problem at the other location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| So, Mr. Frost, I'm going to ask that I want to assume that these are site-specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1442)|
| 0:24:08| and the management company would not be responsible for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| Well, a beer permit is granted for each particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| There's a provision under the ordinances where a business is operating in the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| Two or more businesses, you can operate under the same beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1464)|
| 0:24:29| but because this is physically a totally different building in a different part of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| the only beer permit that came into question was the one here on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1475)|
| 0:24:47| Vice Mayor Pavlis, I share your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| We might look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| Let me ask a question along those same lines, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| I remember when Copper Cellar, we had the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| Their management showed up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| and they were the ones that presented a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| even though it was specifically a particular one of their stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| So it goes in line with what you're saying, Vice Mayor, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| I was just wondering if there's a different management in each store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1513)|
| 0:25:17| so that not only was there a closing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| but we're looking to a different management team in the other operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| I don't know if we know that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| That's my understanding, that the person who was the manager at this Buffalo Wild Wings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| is now managing a Buffalo Wild Wings in West Virginia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| and the rest of the staff at this Cumberland location has dispersed to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| So there's no Brooke Douglas or Christopher Pack with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1541)|
| 0:25:48| So there's no Brooke Douglas or Christopher Pack with the organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1552)|
| 0:25:55| They paid the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| They did pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| And they're closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| And I have originally been told that they might not have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1561)|
| 0:26:04| And so the citation can't be a third citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| There's no business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| So the license is basically forfeited or closed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| We can't revoke the license at the other location, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| So we don't have any remedy anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| The other location would have to start the process of doing inappropriate things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| whether it's sales to a minor or after-hours sales, and go through the one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| So I think it's, as Councilman Greer pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| we had some other restaurants that were part of the chain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1594)|
| 0:26:37| and it was just one restaurant that had the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| The next hearing is for the Magnolia Quick Mart, 3039 Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1601)|
| 0:26:52| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| My name is Norman McKellar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| I'm an attorney here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I represent Magnolia Quick Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| And I apologize on behalf of my client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| who's unable to be here as he's out of town with his wife as she undergoes a medical procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| But we have submitted our revised remedial plan along with a payment of the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1627)|
| 0:27:16| Any comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| Councilman DeLaval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| Is there any additional training being given, Mr. McKellar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| Obviously, you're putting in the age verifier machines and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| Are you having ongoing training as part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| They are, Your Honor, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1650)|
| 0:27:35| In addition to the training that each employee is now receiving as they undertake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1655)|
| 0:27:40| this specific employee who violated the ordinance has undergone remedial training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| We enclosed a copy in our packet of the certificate of his completion of the Tennessee alcohol server knowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| by the Tennessee Regional Safety Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Again, that's remedial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| But as far as a proactive step, there is training in place for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1676)|
| 0:28:02| Well, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| Thank you very much for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Do I have a motion to accept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| I guess I'm going to be the problem child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1691)|
| 0:28:12| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| It's a Nick thing, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1695)|
| 0:28:17| A Nick in time, they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| You know, I appreciate the fact that, you know, they have a medical situation and, you know, those arise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1699)|
| 0:28:27| But, you know, I just really like to hear from the people who own the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| I mean, I just do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| And, you know, it's not my district, but I just think that I know in the past we have postponed these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1714)|
| 0:28:42| and asked, you know, the owner to perhaps come to the next meeting and be present and hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| And this gentleman's very eloquent and done a great job of telling us what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| But I'd still like to hear it from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I'm not going to make a motion as such, but that's just my feeling on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Anyone else have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| We postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I'll ask for this motion to postpone until the next spear board hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| So we can hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| So we can hear from the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1756)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| Can I inquire, the effect of that, does it affect their operation over the next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| or just whether or not we finally accepted their remedial plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| I believe it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| The latter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| The latter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Was there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| All those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I mean, I'm going to vote against the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| If that's a requirement, I think we need to have it be a requirement that the owners come in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1782)|
| 0:29:50| So you're suggesting that we need to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| and perhaps rewrite the requirement down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| If we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| I don't think it's fair to the owners to tell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| if you pay the fine and you come up with a remedial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| then we'll look at it and vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And then if they don't show up, then tell them that it's because they weren't here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| I just think that's – and I assume that we have the power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| If it's important to us that the owners come here and talk to us directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| then I think we should make that a rule that they're aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1820)|
| 0:30:23| But just to do it, you know, on a whim, I don't think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1829)|
| 0:30:30| I want to ask Vice Mayor Pavlis, has that been a past practice of our billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| to pretty much require them to come in themselves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| There is precedent in this case that when we had recently –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| a person had a very similar situation and we postponed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| and they came back and addressed the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1849)|
| 0:30:54| And I just – I hear what Councilman Starr is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| but I think it makes a difference to be able to hear it from the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1857)|
| 0:31:01| who really have a stake in the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| It's their – you know, it's their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| And, you know, they don't – I just think it's the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| And if we need to change it, then let's look at it and change it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| but everybody can vote as they see fit on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1875)|
| 0:31:19| Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1879)|
| 0:31:20| If I could ask Mr. McKellar, Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| do you think your client would be willing to do that, come back and see us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| It does have a certain value of reinforcing the commitment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| and this body does take seriously the idea of sales to underage folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1892)|
| 0:31:37| Would your client comply with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| I realize he's paid his lawyer good money to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| and you have done a good job doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| But would that be acceptable to your client?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| My client just wants to get this worked out, and that's what the board wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| I'm sure he'll be happy to be here next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| We have a motion on the floor at this time to postpone –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| to ask the owner to be here in the next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| In March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| In March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| So the next meeting is in about March the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| 21st or thereabouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| You'll get a letter about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| Wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Madam Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Will someone take a look at our existing rule and see if we perhaps should have an adjustment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| Maybe Rob Frost could look at that for us and see if there's a phrase we shouldn't be adding to our ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| or our rule on these remedial matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| Just so – because the point he made is a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| and that is people should be aware that that's the requirement if we're going to insist on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1961)|
| 0:32:46| and not have the sense, well, I've hired a lawyer, I've done the plan, I've done my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1966)|
| 0:32:51| But there is – I think your point is a good one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| that there is some value to reinforcing the significance of that to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| that those rules be obeyed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| But Marshall's suggestion of having clarity in the rules is a good one, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| Mr. Frost, is that something you could look at for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| I'm making notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Mr. Frost, could perhaps this be clarified in the letter that goes to the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| that we do expect the owner to come to these meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| I'll look at the – where we stand on the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| and if we're able to amend it and report back to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2003)|
| 0:33:26| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2006)|
| 0:33:28| The next is Latitude 3516 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2008)|
| 0:33:40| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I am Harry Wade, and the address of the restaurant is 16 Market Square Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| and I'm one of the operating partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Could you tell us about your remedial plan, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Well, our remedial plan is self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| We – frankly, we were – thought we were doing a good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and as you know, we rely on young people to do what we tell them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| And as is amazing, they don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| They do expressly what we tell them not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| At any rate, one of our servers was very careless and at the wrong time at the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2055)|
| 0:34:22| And all we can do is keep emphasizing daily, weekly, and monthly that we take this seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2062)|
| 0:34:31| and we have no intent of serving underage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2071)|
| 0:34:37| I noticed in your plan that you're having the server who was involved interview the other servers, I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| And then what is happening after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2087)|
| 0:34:51| Well, I'm not real sure what our steps – our manager would be handling the actual steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| But we want to assure – in fact, in our particular case, just for y'all's interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| one server took the order and put it in without checking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| and another server delivered the drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| Interestingly enough, the server that delivered the drinks was the one that got cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| A little inequity there, but it showed that two of them didn't do what they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| And the one that took the order without asking for ID received no punishment whatsoever, except internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2124)|
| 0:35:34| Do I have any comments from the other members of the VIER Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Could you be more specific in terms of – you know, it says here that you have the person that did the violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| does an interview process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| Again, you know, as you heard earlier, the Board takes this pretty seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| and this is the second time, you know, a sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| But exactly what do you have in place in order to, you know, prevent this from happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2156)|
| 0:36:04| Councilman Grieve, there's – I know it's easy for me to sit here and tell you we tell them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| and we tell them and we tell them, but that's what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And I'm in the restaurant quite frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| I watch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| The managers watch them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| The manager on duty watches them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| It just happens, and it's just carelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| And yet it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| We chastise them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| We did not dismiss these two ladies, and we don't plan to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Now, if they do it again, we plan to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| Do they have – do you have cards for them to use or, you know, what – I'm looking for specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2193)|
| 0:36:39| Well, specifically, and I was in there the other night, and they asked for my ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| So I had to show them my ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| My wife had to show them her ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| So they check everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| And if you go in there as young-looking as you are, Councilman, they're probably going to ask for yours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2210)|
| 0:36:55| and I've seen –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| He's kind of grizzled-looking to me, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| I've seen Councilman Sanders in there, and I don't know if they've ID'd you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| but I don't know if you were drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| At any rate, it's a regretful situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| It is very difficult to contain in an environment like ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| We have three bars, and it's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2233)|
| 0:37:17| I guess what I'm asking is what specifically – if I come to you and want to be hired to work in your bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| what do you do for me to understand what it is that I have to do as an employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2244)|
| 0:37:30| Well, the first thing is we probably wouldn't think you're qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2250)|
| 0:37:33| But if we did, that was supposed to be funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2256)|
| 0:37:38| I don't mean to be humorous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2258)|
| 0:37:40| This is a pretty serious situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2260)|
| 0:37:42| Well, it's very serious to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| And the very first thing we would tell you is that do not serve anyone without checking their ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2264)|
| 0:37:53| And we would tell you that every day, every week, repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| And if you do, you're going to face serious consequences, such as losing your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2279)|
| 0:38:08| Councilman Deleveaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I appreciate your coming before us and telling us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| And I can see, you know, with human nature, that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| One person takes the order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| You would have expected that person to be sure the people were qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| The other person then picks up the tray to help out and carries the drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| But I guess you have now a procedure in place where you don't do that unless at least the second person says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| have you ID'd them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| Because if not, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| And the second person would then go up and say, can I see your ID?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Verify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| Well, thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| And let me add one other thing to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2321)|
| 0:38:42| This particular instance, the cadet and the officer were downstairs, and they were carded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2322)|
| 0:38:51| and they were told that they had to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2331)|
| 0:38:54| And they went upstairs and found another place to sit and then ordered again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2334)|
| 0:38:59| And I'm sure that's okay, but that was the situation surrounding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2339)|
| 0:39:06| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| I would just like to commend you for not dismissing them on the first offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| I think it's a better decision to train them because you've invested a lot of money on the front end to train them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| to get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Now, like you say, you know, if it's a reoccurrence, then obviously they're not listening very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| But so many times people come down here and address this floor and say, well, we just fired them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| like the problem goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| You know, I don't know if commend is the right word, but I'm glad that you trained them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| Well, these were two very good services, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| And I'm just glad you're training them rather than just dismissing them, you know, right on the outset of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| I think it's good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Mr. Wade, one thing that I was getting around to is I don't know if you've used the services of the Metropolitan Drug,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| I think it's Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| The Metropolitan Drug Commission has a program where they work with owners of these kind of establishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2402)|
| 0:40:09| and also have training type material that you can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| And I don't know if you're aware of that or if you've talked about that, but those services are available to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2413)|
| 0:40:19| And I believe I think our council here would agree that it's been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| Someone else might want to chime in about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| But that is something available to you that really can work with you and your servers in terms of this kind of situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| I'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| They will be contacting you possibly tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Any other comments from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Well, I do have a comment, and I did not think that this was a very satisfactory plan that you submitted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| Like Vice Mayor Pavlis, I commend you for not firing the two people involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| but I really didn't think that this was a very substantial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| Does council want to take any further action, or are we satisfied as a whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2458)|
| 0:41:04| I move that we accept the explanation and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2467)|
| 0:41:08| Especially with the follow-up with the Metropolitan Drug Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| I think that will give them an additional tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| They have little cards you can slide over the license plate, so it highlights the information, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2473)|
| 0:41:19| that might help your servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| We don't need to have a motion or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2481)|
| 0:41:25| We'd either accept the plan or we don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| and obviously we're going to accept the plan because I haven't heard anybody say reject it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2487)|
| 0:41:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2491)|
| 0:41:32| I reject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| You'll reject it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| I would second Councilman Della Vopi's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| There's no motion on the floor right now because I need some advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| Either there's going to be no further action on the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| the equivalent would be that would be accepted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| or someone is going to need to make a motion to send them to a suspension revocation hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2515)|
| 0:42:02| which it's within council's discretion to do or not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2522)|
| 0:42:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I don't think the plan, I don't think what he's submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| and based on what these other people have submitted, that you haven't submitted enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| I mean, we need a written plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| They need to sign something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| They need to do something more than just training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| I think it's inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| And I would move that we deny it or we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| In that case, I would need a motion to send them to a suspension revocation hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| That's quite a serious step because that would mean that they could conceivably lose their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| But I do agree with you that this plan is not adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| But at the same time, perhaps we need to be much more clear in our expectations about a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2565)|
| 0:42:52| As with some other things, we may need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you are the experienced beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| Well, so is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| There's no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| Would it be appropriate perhaps to defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2586)|
| 0:43:11| and have him come back with a different plan rather than send it to a revocation suspension hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2591)|
| 0:43:19| And perhaps at that point we can decide if they've done enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Yeah, I think that what we're looking for, just like what Councilman Wallace said, is a definite plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| And I think with letting him know about the Metropolitan Drug Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| and this sort of thing that he has the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| Yeah, I'm not willing to go to that next step without giving him the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| So I think that if we could postpone it for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| Does that take a motion, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Yes, that takes a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| I move we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2635)|
| 0:43:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2636)|
| 0:43:57| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2637)|
| 0:43:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2639)|
| 0:44:00| Now, sir, Heather, could you hold your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| Behind you is a young lady with her hand in the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| She represents the Metropolitan Drug Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| and I'm pretty confident that they will help you have a substantial plan to bring back to us in our next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2648)|
| 0:44:16| I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2656)|
| 0:44:17| You did ask how many voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| Did you ask how many voted no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2659)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| I did not ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| Are there any no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you, and thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| We do take it seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| I'm sorry that I appear a little bit flipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I didn't mean to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2671)|
| 0:44:32| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| I'm doing what we're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| We will meet your standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| We appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| Do we have anyone sign up for public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| Do I hear a motion to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd120221?start=2688)|
