| 2:23:43| located southwest side of Lovell Road, southeast of I-40-75 in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8623)|
| 2:23:51| Move to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8631)|
| 2:23:54| Is the applicant here, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8634)|
| 2:23:57| Let's have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8638)|
| 2:23:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8639)|
| 2:24:01| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8641)|
| 2:24:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| We don't have the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8653)|
| 2:24:14| We do not have the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8654)|
| 2:24:18| We're on De La Rocha, 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8658)|
| 2:24:24| Withdrawal my second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8664)|
| 2:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8668)|
| 2:24:29| Withdrawal my first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8669)|
| 2:24:30| Is it the constant that we move this to the end of the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8673)|
| 2:24:34| We'll move it to the end and see if they show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8674)|
| 2:24:38| If not, we'll defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8680)|
| 2:24:41| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8681)|
| 2:24:42| 12-B-12-SP is a request of Knox County Commission for northeast county sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8682)|
| 2:24:49| from agricultural rural residential and neighborhood commercial to rural commercial property located northeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8689)|
| 2:24:56| side of Tillett Lane, northeast of Corrington Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8696)|
| 2:25:01| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8701)|
| 2:25:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| I would move that we do what this particular petitioner is asking for, that we approve his petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8707)|
| 2:25:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8720)|
| 2:25:21| Now, then, we're going to have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| There has been late-breaking news in this particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8725)|
| 2:25:29| and the piece of property that we're speaking of is a panhandle off of the back of a rather large commercial site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8729)|
| 2:25:38| What has been proposed is that there may be a property swap between these two property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8738)|
| 2:25:48| to get us out of having to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| I believe we discussed it last month, and this probably, to me, looks like it should all be in the same zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8752)|
| 2:26:00| But if the two property owners can come to an agreement about land swap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8760)|
| 2:26:06| it will take it off the table for us and we won't have to make that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8766)|
| 2:26:10| So in light of that, I'd propose I move that I guess I would amend my motion to say that we defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8770)|
| 2:26:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8780)|
| 2:26:21| Excuse me, until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8783)|
| 2:26:24| Does the seconder agree to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8784)|
| 2:26:28| And, Mr. Smith, would you like to second that deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8788)|
| 2:26:33| Second the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8793)|
| 2:26:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8794)|
| 2:26:35| Any further discussion of the deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8795)|
| 2:26:37| Thirty days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8797)|
| 2:26:38| Until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8798)|
| 2:26:39| Next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| Dave doesn't need to go back to MPC, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8801)|
| 2:26:42| No, this is the circumstances will be exactly like presented to us tonight if they do not arrive at an amicable solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8802)|
| 2:26:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| Does anyone else have any opinion of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8815)|
| 2:27:02| Is there any opposition to, do you know of opposition to this, Mr. Wright, outside of the parties involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8822)|
| 2:27:10| No, I do not know of other opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8830)|
| 2:27:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| Yes, the property owner petitioning is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8841)|
| 2:27:23| So we've got the motion to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| Defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| It will be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8852)|
| 2:27:36| On page 17, 9-A-12-RC is a request of Jack Walker for rezoning from general residential to rural commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8856)|
| 2:27:46| Property located northeast side of Tillett Lane, northeast of Corentin Road in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8866)|
| 2:27:51| Move to defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8875)|
| 2:27:57| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8877)|
| 2:28:01| All in favor of the deferral say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8881)|
| 2:28:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8884)|
| 2:28:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8885)|
| 2:28:06| Ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8886)|
| 2:28:14| Amendments to the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8894)|
| 2:28:17| This is O-13-1-101, consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8897)|
| 2:28:24| amending Article 3 of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance, Appendix A of the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| to prohibit billboards and other advertising structures in all zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8909)|
| 2:28:34| Ordinance number O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8914)|
| 2:28:40| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8920)|
| 2:28:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8922)|
| 2:28:43| Dr. Briggs, would you like to lead us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8923)|
| 2:28:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8926)|
| 2:28:47| Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8927)|
| 2:28:49| As you know from the post that I put on the Commission forum that I think that most of you have read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8929)|
| 2:28:56| I would like to ask us to withdraw this, and I want to make the same request for the next one, which is the 102 ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8936)|
| 2:29:04| We've listened to a lot of arguments for the billboards, a lot of arguments against the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| and we've received numerous e-mails from citizens throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8950)|
| 2:29:16| And I think most of us agree we need to do something about the billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8956)|
| 2:29:20| but there's a lot of us also that feel strongly that a compromise of some sort is in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8960)|
| 2:29:26| rather than an outright ban on some of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8966)|
| 2:29:29| We checked with the Commission office, I guess it was on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8969)|
| 2:29:35| and there's been over 400 e-mails and telephone calls that have come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8975)|
| 2:29:40| and I would say it's probably 95% or more are people who want bans on all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8980)|
| 2:29:47| on both the conventional billboards, the electronic message centers, as well as the digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8987)|
| 2:29:53| Nevertheless, when we've listened to the deliberations and the debates that have gone down here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8993)|
| 2:29:59| we've heard from a lot of small, local business people who own the signed companies, as well as the large companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=8999)|
| 2:30:07| that it would cause a lot of harm, particularly to the small businesses that are based in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9007)|
| 2:30:12| if we completely ban the billboards and the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9012)|
| 2:30:17| We've also heard from some businesses that it would limit their ability to advertise and to market their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9017)|
| 2:30:24| and it would also have an adverse effect in attracting customers to their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9024)|
| 2:30:29| And then there's also this issue that I think some people make some good points on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9029)|
| 2:30:36| is how much really should the government be interfering in what we do with what people do to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9036)|
| 2:30:42| And I think we have to take all of those things into consideration when we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9042)|
| 2:30:49| And for that reason, I would like for us to withdraw from consideration Ordinance 101, and we can have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9049)|
| 2:30:58| It will be ditto for what I'll say about the next one, which is 102, which deals with the electronic message centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9058)|
| 2:31:04| I would recommend that we send these back to the NPC where we can get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9064)|
| 2:31:10| And this is even what the billboard industry asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9070)|
| 2:31:13| They said, let's send it back to the NPC, let the NPC, the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9073)|
| 2:31:18| and the county commission work on regulating and not banning at least the conventional billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9078)|
| 2:31:24| and the electronic message centers if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9084)|
| 2:31:28| I think it does need to go back to the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9088)|
| 2:31:32| When it goes back to the NPC, we can do nothing and leave the things the way they are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9092)|
| 2:31:37| We can decide on the best ways to regulate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9097)|
| 2:31:41| And also, I think we ought to look at maybe rather than having specific regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9101)|
| 2:31:48| but when someone needs to put up a billboard or an EMC is do a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9108)|
| 2:31:53| And in those cases, the business owner who wants to do this or the sign owner or the property owner can come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9113)|
| 2:32:01| and give us the reasons why they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9121)|
| 2:32:03| Citizens that may or may not have objections can come down and say why or why it should not be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9123)|
| 2:32:11| And it really fits into that category of there's a time and place for everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9131)|
| 2:32:17| and you probably can't regulate that with codes every single situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9137)|
| 2:32:23| And it really gives us the flexibility for people to advertise, for people to put up signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9143)|
| 2:32:27| but also for the citizens to have an input into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9147)|
| 2:32:30| And that's really what I would like to see us do with these first two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9150)|
| 2:32:36| And I'll address the third, which is the digital billboards, when we come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9156)|
| 2:32:43| Okay. Thank you, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9163)|
| 2:32:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9164)|
| 2:32:45| We have a second for this motion to withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9165)|
| 2:32:48| Do we have some other discussion among the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9168)|
| 2:32:51| We have several people signed up to speak, and I'm going to offer that to those, that opportunity in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9171)|
| 2:33:00| Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| I just have a question for MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| The moratorium on permits for billboards expires on the 31st of January, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9183)|
| 2:33:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9195)|
| 2:33:17| For some reason, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9197)|
| 2:33:18| That mic's not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9198)|
| 2:33:22| The moratorium was established by the County Commission, independent of MPC, so Daniel is the keeper of that record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9202)|
| 2:33:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9209)|
| 2:33:30| So if we kick this back to MPC and they come up with some regulations or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9210)|
| 2:33:36| and send it back, it could be a few months, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9216)|
| 2:33:40| So all during that time, permits can be pulled for putting up billboards anywhere, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9220)|
| 2:33:49| Unless there is an extension of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9229)|
| 2:33:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9232)|
| 2:33:53| Can you explain to us how that permitting process works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9233)|
| 2:33:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| That would be a Roy Braden question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9238)|
| 2:34:02| There's Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9242)|
| 2:34:03| He'll take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| I'm Bill Pierce, County Codes, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9247)|
| 2:34:10| The applicant brings applications in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9250)|
| 2:34:13| We do field checks to verify compliance with all the regulations in the zoning ordinance as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9253)|
| 2:34:18| And if they comply, they get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9258)|
| 2:34:21| And how long does that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9261)|
| 2:34:23| It's generally a week to two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9263)|
| 2:34:25| And how long is the permit good for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9265)|
| 2:34:27| They have to start construction within six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9267)|
| 2:34:29| Within six months, not 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9269)|
| 2:34:33| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9273)|
| 2:34:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9275)|
| 2:34:36| Because in a meeting we were at yesterday, I understood it was 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9276)|
| 2:34:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9280)|
| 2:34:41| Six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9281)|
| 2:34:42| Six months is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9282)|
| 2:34:43| So anyone could go out and pull a bunch of permits for billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9283)|
| 2:34:49| And even if MPC comes back with something, with some kind of regulation for billboards during the next six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9289)|
| 2:34:56| it still wouldn't apply to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9296)|
| 2:34:58| They would probably be grandfathered in, all permits that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9298)|
| 2:35:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9302)|
| 2:35:03| They would be allowed to be built under the regulations they were permitted under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9303)|
| 2:35:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9306)|
| 2:35:07| So why are we even bothering to send this back to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9307)|
| 2:35:18| You weren't trying to hammer out all these details tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| No, I think it, well, my preference would be just to amend this to add a use on review, not to ban them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9321)|
| 2:35:29| but to permit them as long as there's a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9329)|
| 2:35:31| It's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9331)|
| 2:35:32| It's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9332)|
| 2:35:33| It takes care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9333)|
| 2:35:34| And it doesn't open a whole big can of worms about are we going to permit or are we going to regulate or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9334)|
| 2:35:41| That would be my preference, but it's not my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9341)|
| 2:35:48| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9348)|
| 2:35:50| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| I guess I'm not understanding what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9351)|
| 2:35:55| Is the motion to withdraw because Commissioner Briggs said a whole lot, but at the end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9355)|
| 2:36:03| because he talked about use on review, he talked about some of the other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| I'm going to ask Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| I'm going to yield the floor to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9368)|
| 2:36:10| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9370)|
| 2:36:11| What I would like to do is withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9371)|
| 2:36:14| and I understand that any use on review is a substantial change from what we have right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| and that may not be permitted under our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9380)|
| 2:36:22| That's why I did not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9383)|
| 2:36:24| So that needs to be settled with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| So I'll defer to the law director to kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9390)|
| 2:36:35| I do believe that if you were to add a use on review condition to either of these amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| that it would be a substantial change and it would need to go back before MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9400)|
| 2:36:43| so that they could recommend the particulars of that process per the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9403)|
| 2:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9409)|
| 2:36:50| So since MPC brought this to us, they would need to bring us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9410)|
| 2:36:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9412)|
| 2:36:53| The reason I mentioned those other things is what our options could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9413)|
| 2:36:55| It would be nothing to come up with more codes and regulations or to do a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9415)|
| 2:37:02| And that's what I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9422)|
| 2:37:03| I am agreeing with everything that you said, seeing, you know, kind of reading the tea leaves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9423)|
| 2:37:09| I think that's a great compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9429)|
| 2:37:13| My concern is similar to Commissioner Burroughs in that I would hate for us to give a rabbit hole here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9433)|
| 2:37:25| that we find ourselves regretting later on in terms of just clogging up the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9445)|
| 2:37:32| I'm not saying anyone from the billboard industry would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9452)|
| 2:37:35| But if you have one person that runs and pulls 20, now we've got an issue that we've got to dig ourselves out of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9455)|
| 2:37:41| So I guess is there anything that we can do to kind of alleviate that for until we get this thing settled is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9461)|
| 2:37:51| And it's an honest and open question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9471)|
| 2:37:53| I don't have an answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9473)|
| 2:37:54| But I would just hate for us just to withdraw it and then come Friday, here we are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9474)|
| 2:38:01| with a lot of folks knocking down the codes folks' office doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9481)|
| 2:38:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9489)|
| 2:38:10| I think that's directed to you, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9490)|
| 2:38:13| Is there effectively any safeguards or things that we might do to prevent a sudden influx of permits going out of billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9493)|
| 2:38:24| just because we withdrew this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9504)|
| 2:38:30| Without a moratorium in place, we're operating under the pending ordinance doctrine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9510)|
| 2:38:37| which says when you have a pending ordinance that regulates the behavior that people will be applying for a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9517)|
| 2:38:44| then permits are effectively suspended while the commission is considering amending that ordinance or regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9524)|
| 2:38:54| So I guess in terms of a question, if we deferred this, could it go back to MPC under the deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9534)|
| 2:39:02| That's at the commission's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| So that could be an option if we deferred this and asked MPC to take a look at the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9545)|
| 2:39:13| That might be a way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9553)|
| 2:39:15| But I'm not the maker of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9555)|
| 2:39:17| If it's withdrawn, then it's no longer in consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9557)|
| 2:39:21| So it's open playing field, right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9561)|
| 2:39:29| Yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9569)|
| 2:39:31| I think if I read the next item, I don't know that there's an intent to withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9571)|
| 2:39:38| But the next item would remain pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9578)|
| 2:39:42| So the items that were drawn, if they weren't pending, you'd be able to apply for a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9582)|
| 2:39:51| But the next item, I don't think there's an intent to withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9591)|
| 2:39:55| So you're saying the traditional billboards and the electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9595)|
| 2:39:59| if we withdrew those, it would be up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9599)|
| 2:40:03| And I hate to use this word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| I'm not being negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9604)|
| 2:40:05| But it would be open season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9605)|
| 2:40:06| But for the electronic piece, if we do something with that, then it would still be pending is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9606)|
| 2:40:15| The language is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9615)|
| 2:40:16| It must be pending before the commission, which means the commission must be actively considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9616)|
| 2:40:23| You do get into a gray area where, just as with the moratorium, you're no longer in a moratorium situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9623)|
| 2:40:34| You are in a pending ordinance situation, and that can't go on forever either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9639)|
| 2:40:40| So just for the reasons that I laid out, not to deal with, to shoot down the business industry at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9640)|
| 2:40:51| but I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9651)|
| 2:40:58| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9658)|
| 2:41:01| I knew you were going to ask that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9661)|
| 2:41:03| I guess I would look to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9663)|
| 2:41:04| That's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9664)|
| 2:41:05| I'm going to have to look to MPC to ask how long is reasonable, an expedited process, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9665)|
| 2:41:12| How long is a reasonably expedited process to get something back to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9672)|
| 2:41:20| Well, I can tell you an anecdote about the city's sign code task force, which when it meets next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9680)|
| 2:41:28| we'll be celebrating its one-year anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9688)|
| 2:41:33| You've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| And that task force was originally intended simply to look at sign height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9694)|
| 2:41:44| So it could be a very long time, and that depends on the direction that you provide us going into the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9704)|
| 2:41:53| through the rest of the discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9713)|
| 2:41:56| I think Commissioner Briggs has laid out some pretty good, you know, tenets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9716)|
| 2:42:02| some foundational points that we think the business industry is okay with from what we've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9722)|
| 2:42:10| and that sounds like, you know, a lot of us are pushing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9730)|
| 2:42:16| So in terms of what we will want from a new billboard permit process, you know, the use and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9736)|
| 2:42:23| So I don't see a whole lot more coming out of that to where we could probably give you all the skeleton on what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9743)|
| 2:42:33| But to answer Commissioner Andrews' question, I think we do need to give them a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9753)|
| 2:42:40| I'll survey the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| I don't think I have a second yet, but I guess people are waiting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9764)|
| 2:42:45| Will you restate your substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9765)|
| 2:42:46| My substitute motion is that we defer this ordinance on first reading for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9766)|
| 2:42:58| Two meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9778)|
| 2:42:59| Two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9779)|
| 2:43:00| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9780)|
| 2:43:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9781)|
| 2:43:02| For two meetings to the March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9782)|
| 2:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9785)|
| 2:43:06| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9789)|
| 2:43:10| So there's our sub motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9790)|
| 2:43:11| More discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9791)|
| 2:43:12| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9792)|
| 2:43:14| You know, Sam, I didn't realize that what I was saying with withdrawal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9794)|
| 2:43:18| and deferral are a little bit different is the deferral means we're going to come back with a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9798)|
| 2:43:23| The withdrawal means is that we're going to come back with something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| Well, I think the difference is you withdraw, you have nothing, you defer it, you have something pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9807)|
| 2:43:34| and there's not a proliferation of new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9814)|
| 2:43:36| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9816)|
| 2:43:37| Or an abundance of new billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9817)|
| 2:43:39| That's my sole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9819)|
| 2:43:40| So those are the two differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| You could come back with the same thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| but you want to have something on the table to discuss or to have pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9824)|
| 2:43:50| because if you don't, then they can go and get 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9830)|
| 2:43:55| I don't think there's going to be 20 permits, but it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9835)|
| 2:43:58| And I would say, MPC, please don't bring us back the same ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| I don't think you all would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9842)|
| 2:44:04| I think on first reading, since they brought it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| that they could bring something back after hearing our dialogue as to what we would want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9847)|
| 2:44:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9853)|
| 2:44:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9854)|
| 2:44:15| Mr. Shouse, I think was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| I think that's reasonable as long as it's clear what our intent is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| But has the moratorium scenario gone beyond its useful life, can't use that anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9860)|
| 2:44:27| Is that why we're not interested in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9867)|
| 2:44:29| We're in jeopardy from our law director if we continue the moratorium at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9869)|
| 2:44:34| It seems like the simplest, but if it's lived its life and gone, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9874)|
| 2:44:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9878)|
| 2:44:39| If we need to protect this window here from opening up too wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9883)|
| 2:44:44| Ms. Broils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9884)|
| 2:44:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9885)|
| 2:44:46| I also have tremendous concern for our small business owners in Knox County, my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| We run a small family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| So understanding the struggle with what's been going on in the economy for the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9893)|
| 2:45:00| although my understanding from, well, I'll bring that up another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9900)|
| 2:45:04| But I do have a lot of concern for our small business owners in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9904)|
| 2:45:09| So I am willing to send this to MPC to ask for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9909)|
| 2:45:14| I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9914)|
| 2:45:16| I think it's simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9916)|
| 2:45:18| But I cannot ignore the over 400 emails that we've gotten from our constituents who have said they do not want more billboards of any kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9918)|
| 2:45:28| digital or static.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9928)|
| 2:45:30| I cannot easily put that out of my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9930)|
| 2:45:34| And I would hope that the rest of you would feel the same and would take their opposition seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9934)|
| 2:45:41| So I feel like this is a good compromise where we can have a better process in place that's not going to hurt our small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9941)|
| 2:45:53| owners but will also respect the wishes of our constituents who have made their wishes abundantly clear to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9953)|
| 2:46:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9960)|
| 2:46:01| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9961)|
| 2:46:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9962)|
| 2:46:03| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9963)|
| 2:46:04| If we are to maintain our normal rhythm of flow from MPC recommendation to county commission consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9964)|
| 2:46:12| we cannot bring something back to you by March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| Our February agenda is already set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| We are currently in the last week of application deadlines for our March agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9978)|
| 2:46:24| So we would need at least a deferral until April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9984)|
| 2:46:34| So you don't think if, and this is an if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9994)|
| 2:46:39| if we give you all some pretty strong tenets as to which to, you know, hang this ordinance on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| that you can get it done by the March meeting to where we could add it to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10005)|
| 2:46:53| We could get it on our March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10013)|
| 2:46:55| But our normal flow of process is to take it to the county commission meeting the following month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10015)|
| 2:47:03| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10023)|
| 2:47:09| Yeah, I would hate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| But I understand that and that makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| I know we kind of set our agenda as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| I hope that doesn't do too much damage to the motion if I amended it to April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10039)|
| 2:47:27| Again, I don't want to delay this anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10047)|
| 2:47:32| But hearing what Mr. Donaldson has hit us with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10052)|
| 2:47:35| I'm going to amend my motion to have it come back to us in the April meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10055)|
| 2:47:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| Is that okay with you, Mr. Royles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| So 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10068)|
| 2:47:49| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10069)|
| 2:47:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| Part of this problem is our fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| I think if you go back and check the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| you would find out that we sent it back to MPC with no direction whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10078)|
| 2:48:06| Up until the last week or so, there's been no direction designated from any direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10086)|
| 2:48:16| It's just been a big stupor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| Everybody's got a spoon in there stirring it 17 different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10098)|
| 2:48:22| So that part does fall on us, the fact of this delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10102)|
| 2:48:30| The second thing I want to bring up, and this is personal poof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10110)|
| 2:48:36| and I'm going to take a personal privilege and do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| but it's been mentioned several times about the hundreds of e-mails that we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10119)|
| 2:48:45| This happens every time we have a major issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10125)|
| 2:48:51| But my personal feeling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10131)|
| 2:48:53| and I would venture to say that I can speak for a whole lot more folks sitting around this table up here too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10133)|
| 2:48:59| is that if you want to send an e-mail to a county commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10139)|
| 2:49:04| you should be able to take the minute or two it takes to put your own thoughts down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| and send that e-mail rather than taking one that's come from a blast e-mail blast list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10149)|
| 2:49:17| from XYZ Corporation and whoever, wherever, that says exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10157)|
| 2:49:25| I mean, word for word for word for word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10165)|
| 2:49:29| We got one today that had 103 on one e-mail, all exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10169)|
| 2:49:36| We had another one that had 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| One last week that had 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10178)|
| 2:49:40| One that had 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10180)|
| 2:49:42| All saying exactly the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10182)|
| 2:49:45| We want to hear from people, but if you can't take the time to give us two minutes of your time to give us your thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10185)|
| 2:49:55| and not somebody else's, I'd prefer not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10195)|
| 2:50:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10201)|
| 2:50:02| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10202)|
| 2:50:04| Yeah, I had two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10204)|
| 2:50:05| I'm just going to respond to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| I mean, that's like what a petition is, is when a community goes around to the neighborhood and gets signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10207)|
| 2:50:12| It's one signature on a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10212)|
| 2:50:14| I think it's just that people are signing on to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10214)|
| 2:50:16| I do agree with you that a personalized e-mail means a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10216)|
| 2:50:20| but a petition is where you're signing something that someone else has written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10220)|
| 2:50:24| It's just showing that there is a lot of support for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10224)|
| 2:50:27| But I understand the point you're trying to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10227)|
| 2:50:29| I had a legal question and a legal concern for the law office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10229)|
| 2:50:33| If we defer this and the moratorium expires on January the 30th, why, deferring it prevents permits from being issued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10233)|
| 2:50:45| if the moratorium expires in a few days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| And, I mean, it seems to imply that what we're doing is that that's still going to prevent anyone from getting a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10248)|
| 2:50:55| just because we've deferred this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10255)|
| 2:50:59| I think once it's on your agenda, it's sufficiently pending to serve as a mechanism to prevent further permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10259)|
| 2:51:07| as long as it's pending on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10270)|
| 2:51:11| I didn't realize if you had something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| That answers my question then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10272)|
| 2:51:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10276)|
| 2:51:17| We have several people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| And, of course, we're trying to address this particular issue, which is 101 on static billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10281)|
| 2:51:32| So of the list of people that I have to speak, if you've signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10292)|
| 2:51:37| are there some of you who would like to speak on this issue regarding this discussion that we just entered into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10297)|
| 2:51:47| Is there anybody that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10307)|
| 2:51:52| Mr. Ammons, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10312)|
| 2:51:57| Danny Ammons, 4704 Meredith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10317)|
| 2:52:00| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10320)|
| 2:52:02| I'd like to publicly apologize to you for my statement at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10322)|
| 2:52:06| Oh, Mr. Ammons, that was nothing compared to the bashing that I took earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| So don't worry about that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10331)|
| 2:52:16| I would like to address the issue of, and I really don't even know where to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10336)|
| 2:52:22| The discussion is about you guys aren't even sure what you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10342)|
| 2:52:28| We've been here four and a half years for you all to take specific problems in our ordinances and look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10348)|
| 2:52:35| And I'm sorry for my tone, but I have to get a little aggressive here because the wheels are just spinning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10355)|
| 2:52:43| And to the e-mail issue, I may not be right, but in 2004 when this issue came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10363)|
| 2:52:49| I went out in one day and got 61 signatures from business owners that didn't want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10369)|
| 2:52:55| And I've still got them in my file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10375)|
| 2:52:57| If you guys want me to go and to stir up Knox County businesses through our resources to let you all know how desperate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10377)|
| 2:53:05| businesses are, then I'll just have to play the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10385)|
| 2:53:08| We had said once we're not the greatest organizers, and I'm not belittling 400 e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10388)|
| 2:53:14| But the reality here is I am a small business owner, and I am not in agreement with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10394)|
| 2:53:21| This does not appeal to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| I do not see this as a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10403)|
| 2:53:25| I see a compromise with you were brought four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10405)|
| 2:53:29| Your terms are like, I don't know if they still are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10409)|
| 2:53:32| Some are six, but they're typically four-year terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10412)|
| 2:53:35| We're over a term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10415)|
| 2:53:37| And I'm sorry for the tone, but the reality is we had some billboards, permits that were pulled in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10417)|
| 2:53:43| I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10423)|
| 2:53:44| They were for digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| They were built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10426)|
| 2:53:47| Most of them were in Lamar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10427)|
| 2:53:49| And you all had a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10429)|
| 2:53:51| These same people had a concern, and they addressed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| And so you guys went out and put a moratorium on digital billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10434)|
| 2:53:59| But then because guys like me were out trying to make a living, and we didn't like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10439)|
| 2:54:03| but we couldn't see going and borrowing at the time $250,000 to put a digital billboard or half a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10443)|
| 2:54:10| So we were just trying to wear our hats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10450)|
| 2:54:13| So the next thing we know, we don't show up to every one of your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10453)|
| 2:54:16| And I didn't show up to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| Ms. Burles, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10458)|
| 2:54:19| I just noticed on the website that you had a meeting the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10459)|
| 2:54:22| I'm not a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10462)|
| 2:54:24| So over time, I was here two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| I was here three years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| We didn't have a voice, but you guys kept delaying it because you didn't really know what to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| I'm assuming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10472)|
| 2:54:34| There are businesses out there that you will hurt, that you have hurt over four years by delaying this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10474)|
| 2:54:41| We do get people to the Cracker Barrel on Merchants Road instead of the one in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10481)|
| 2:54:47| We do catch people before they go to Five Oaks in Sevierville and get them off down at Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10487)|
| 2:54:53| We do promote schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| We do promote a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| This does affect Knox County, not just the people that are sending the e-mails, but the ones in whom have businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10496)|
| 2:55:04| Time avails me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10504)|
| 2:55:05| I don't see this as a compromise because what I see is after you looked at digital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| nobody said specifically with digital they're too bright, they're too close, they're too high, they're too big, they're too wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10509)|
| 2:55:15| they're too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10515)|
| 2:55:16| We heard accusations of them being a danger, but we haven't had any conclusive studies that have proved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10516)|
| 2:55:26| Then reached out by specifically, and I just have to direct it, Dr. Briggs, Commissioner Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10526)|
| 2:55:35| you reached out and grabbed all permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| Well, I wasn't pulling permits because I was just trying to keep my advertisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10538)|
| 2:55:42| And businesses were just trying to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| And so you grabbed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10544)|
| 2:55:45| And then EMCs can have the same thing, and they are bright, and they have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10545)|
| 2:55:48| So you grabbed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| Well, giving me back the two issues that you took in that I don't think you should have is not a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10549)|
| 2:55:56| It would be like you taking something from me and returning it and saying you want a reward for returning it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10556)|
| 2:56:02| So from my perspective, I don't understand all this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10562)|
| 2:56:06| I don't think we're in a time or a place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| Pro-business, you all said you're the keepers of the finances for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10568)|
| 2:56:13| These do bring tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| I've sat through all these meetings that help with the negative of Hillcrest, that end up making up the 800 that wasn't picked up last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10575)|
| 2:56:23| that ends up helping fund the safe places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10583)|
| 2:56:27| I know there's a cost, but the reality is these two should be off the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10587)|
| 2:56:31| They shouldn't be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10591)|
| 2:56:32| We should be talking about issues from the beginning, if you want to, about digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10592)|
| 2:56:36| Are they too bright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10596)|
| 2:56:37| The state's trying to address an issue of them being too bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| And that will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| We've not seen specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| I apologize for my tone, but you can understand my frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10604)|
| 2:56:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| Thank you, Mr. Hammonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10611)|
| 2:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| Anyone else want to speak to this item at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10617)|
| 2:57:02| We've got about eight people that are signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| Mr. Thucyn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10624)|
| 2:57:12| Jim Thucyn says 633 Gulfwood Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| I have no financial interest in the outdoor advertising industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| Outdoor advertising is a lawful industry that provides career employment for many men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10638)|
| 2:57:23| The industry pays Knox County property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| For example, the pilot in McDonald's at Walker Springs near Exxon pays over $9,000 just in property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10646)|
| 2:57:35| Billboards are a form of business communication, and they are essential to many businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10655)|
| 2:57:39| especially interstate highway-related businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10659)|
| 2:57:43| I'm older than most of you, and when I-95 was built between New York and Florida, it created four millionaires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10663)|
| 2:57:50| Those millionaires pay taxes, and they create jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10670)|
| 2:57:54| Prohibiting new billboards prohibits new jobs and new taxes, and Knox County needs both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10674)|
| 2:58:01| At least two-thirds of those ordinances, especially the one prohibiting new jobs, should be rejected immediately, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10681)|
| 2:58:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10688)|
| 2:58:09| I appreciate everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| Thank you, Mr. Thucyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10690)|
| 2:58:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| Anyone else like to speak on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10694)|
| 2:58:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10700)|
| 2:58:21| We have one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10701)|
| 2:58:22| Oh, go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10702)|
| 2:58:28| Behind Joyce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10708)|
| 2:58:33| Hello, ladies and gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10713)|
| 2:58:34| I'm Martin Daniel, 1834 Duncan Woods Lane, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10714)|
| 2:58:40| And I just want to say that with regard to the discussion you all had, whether you call it a pending ordinance or a moratorium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10720)|
| 2:58:49| I think that it's gone along a little too far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10729)|
| 2:58:53| I think that any court that looks at that, any court that looks at the suspension of speech permits for four and a half years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10733)|
| 2:59:04| by whatever you call it is going to think that stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| That is a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10748)|
| 2:59:10| That's an infringement of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10750)|
| 2:59:12| So I think if you delay it any more, you're going to be looking at the possibility of that whatever action you do being stricken down by a court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10752)|
| 2:59:22| Secondly, I want to say that I don't know what, I'm not sure exactly what a use on review is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10762)|
| 2:59:28| but it doesn't sound good because it sounds to me like there are going to be some nebulous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10768)|
| 2:59:35| uncertain factors that might be considered by the commission or by the MPC in connection with a permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10775)|
| 2:59:44| And there again, you're running up against the First Amendment concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10784)|
| 2:59:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10788)|
| 2:59:50| Thank you, Mr. Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10790)|
| 3:00:00| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10800)|
| 3:00:01| My name is Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10801)|
| 3:00:05| And I wasn't going to speak during this phase because I appreciate the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10805)|
| 3:00:10| I think we have had a long time, four years of a moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| It seems to me it's worth 90 more days to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| I definitely am in favor of having use on review because I represent homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10818)|
| 3:00:25| and homeowners pay $2,000 or $3,000 a year per home in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10825)|
| 3:00:30| Just the council of West Knox County homeowners alone represents about 10,000 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10830)|
| 3:00:37| So that's quite a lot of tax dollars as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| And we just want to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10840)|
| 3:00:41| And we want to be able to communicate with these folks who want to do their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| And we want their respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| We want to respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| My concern personally is that right now billboards are allowed in CA, CB, CH, or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10852)|
| 3:01:04| And you would think that that would just be commercial on highways, but it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10864)|
| 3:01:08| because there are sections all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| They might have been a, you know, SO 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10870)|
| 3:01:14| They might have made horseshoes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10874)|
| 3:01:16| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10876)|
| 3:01:17| It's in the middle of neighborhoods now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| But it's its own commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| And so just having use on review means that you have a chance to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10881)|
| 3:01:25| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10885)|
| 3:01:26| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10886)|
| 3:01:29| Thank you, Ms. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10889)|
| 3:01:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10892)|
| 3:01:34| Mr. DeRopp, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10894)|
| 3:01:47| It's scary when I'm starting to remember everybody's name after all these public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10907)|
| 3:01:53| Go ahead, Mr. DeRopp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10913)|
| 3:01:54| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10914)|
| 3:01:57| I am Jim DeRopp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10917)|
| 3:01:58| I'm 4126 Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| I just want to add just a very quick word in support of our previous speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10921)|
| 3:02:10| Not so much the billboards itself, but EMCs really do present an extremely bright situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10930)|
| 3:02:23| Where I live, for example, if there was an EMC across the river, it would destroy my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10943)|
| 3:02:31| Those things you can see from hundreds of yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10951)|
| 3:02:34| So the impact, even though it may be in a commercial zone, the impact of that EMC on adjacent residential areas is immense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10954)|
| 3:02:46| and can destroy property value very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| So I would like to speak in support of the motion that has been made that, yes, a use-on-review for EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10970)|
| 3:02:58| and we can say also for the other billboards, but is essential for the protection of homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10978)|
| 3:03:06| that I'm sure pay an inordinate or at least a large percentage of the total tax base of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10986)|
| 3:03:14| Thank you, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10994)|
| 3:03:16| Thank you, Mr. DeRopp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| Mr. Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=10998)|
| 3:03:21| Thank you, sir. Russ Ammons, 7920 Ewing Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11001)|
| 3:03:24| I would just like to address the issue of use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11004)|
| 3:03:28| What we have in place right now are restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| Our billboards are regulated by the state of Tennessee and they're regulated by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11012)|
| 3:03:39| And Bill Pierce does a good job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| And if you withdraw this, all that's going into place is what has been in place before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| And like I say, I've been in business 15 years here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| I do not have the first billboard on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11031)|
| 3:03:54| Now, albeit part of that is the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| But the reason I don't have one on Kingston Pike is because my competitors, which is a free market, those spots are taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11037)|
| 3:04:04| So for 15 years, if I would have had the ability to put one on Kingston Pike, I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11044)|
| 3:04:10| So if you remove this and withdraw this motion, I'm not going to say there's not going to be 20 billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11050)|
| 3:04:16| I'm not going to pull 20 permits because economically that's disastrous for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11056)|
| 3:04:20| But I'm saying what is in effect, what has been in place, the state regs and the county regs are effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11060)|
| 3:04:29| They work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11069)|
| 3:04:31| And it's been going on for four and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11071)|
| 3:04:33| Please just withdraw this on the billboards if you've got a concern about EMCs and digital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11073)|
| 3:04:39| But just withdraw it because there's no reason for use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11079)|
| 3:04:44| Because if you do, then I'm going to be up here the first time I want to pull one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11084)|
| 3:04:48| And we're going to be doing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| As long as I meet the requirements, then I ought to be able to put up a billboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11090)|
| 3:04:54| And the requirements that are in place are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11094)|
| 3:04:57| But if you send this back to the MPC and say, okay, give me something, he's not going to know what to give you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11097)|
| 3:05:02| That's what you did four and a half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| And we're sitting here just dead in water because nobody has made an attempt to try to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11104)|
| 3:05:09| I mean, we're sitting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11109)|
| 3:05:11| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11111)|
| 3:05:12| I think the regulations you have in effect by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11112)|
| 3:05:15| and the regulations that are imposed by the county do an effective job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11115)|
| 3:05:19| Please just withdraw this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11120)|
| 3:05:21| Thank you, Mr. Ammons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11121)|
| 3:05:24| Okay, any other public comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11124)|
| 3:05:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11141)|
| 3:05:42| My name is Dale Fisher with Modern Outdoor Advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11142)|
| 3:05:46| I just want to say this will negatively affect my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11146)|
| 3:05:49| Like tomorrow, if you all, you know, go ahead and vote the ordinance in tonight or, you know, just disregard it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11149)|
| 3:05:56| I'll probably pull a permit tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| I've been wanting to pull one for about three years, but I've only got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11158)|
| 3:06:03| And I do think the moratorium is against the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11163)|
| 3:06:07| I think you all had it in effect too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11167)|
| 3:06:10| I don't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11170)|
| 3:06:11| I would like to know that answer, if he could answer it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11171)|
| 3:06:15| How long is it in legal terms, how long can you keep a moratorium on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11175)|
| 3:06:23| Is it six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11183)|
| 3:06:24| Is it three terms of six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| Or is it four years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| I've asked that question a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| I never have got the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| I don't know if you all don't know it or just don't want to give it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11192)|
| 3:06:35| or you all are already, you know, past the time, past the deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11195)|
| 3:06:41| And if you all do let this go today and you say the moratorium is over the 31st, January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11201)|
| 3:06:49| is that when we can pull a permit, the 31st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11209)|
| 3:06:54| The law director is going to speak to some of these issues when everybody is finished, Mr. Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11214)|
| 3:07:00| So go right ahead in your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11222)|
| 3:07:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11223)|
| 3:07:04| You know, I just wanted to touch on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11224)|
| 3:07:05| And I think you would be making the right decision by just throwing the whole thing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11225)|
| 3:07:09| You all have enough rules and regulations in place right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11229)|
| 3:07:11| And, you know, it took four years and you still haven't got anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11231)|
| 3:07:14| So, you know, at least let us pull the permits that we've needed to for, like, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11234)|
| 3:07:19| two or three years anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11239)|
| 3:07:21| And then, you know, come back to the table then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11241)|
| 3:07:23| But just as much as just not letting us do anything, I think it's unfair for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11243)|
| 3:07:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| Thank you, Mr. Fisher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| Other public comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11253)|
| 3:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11260)|
| 3:07:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11261)|
| 3:07:42| Mr. Smith, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11262)|
| 3:07:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11264)|
| 3:07:45| And to the audience of those four and the industry, I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11265)|
| 3:07:52| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11272)|
| 3:07:53| You know, we can't keep taking your time month after month after month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11273)|
| 3:07:57| holding these people's businesses up month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11277)|
| 3:07:59| I'm ready to vote with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| That's what we're here to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11282)|
| 3:08:03| We've already wasted 45 minutes to an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11283)|
| 3:08:05| We could have been in deep discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11285)|
| 3:08:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11288)|
| 3:08:09| Mr. Sanders, will you address some of the --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11289)|
| 3:08:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11290)|
| 3:08:11| Go ahead, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11291)|
| 3:08:12| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11292)|
| 3:08:13| What I was going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11293)|
| 3:08:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11294)|
| 3:08:15| He was going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| Yeah, he's going to address some of that as well as a couple of other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| Go ahead, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11298)|
| 3:08:25| There's been some talk about sending an item or this issue back to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11305)|
| 3:08:30| Metropolitan Planning Commission while these ordinances are still pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11310)|
| 3:08:36| I think there would be considerable profit in having a discussion between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11316)|
| 3:08:39| the Metropolitan Planning Commission and the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11319)|
| 3:08:41| I don't mean to extend the meeting too far tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11321)|
| 3:08:43| but give the Metropolitan Planning Commission some direction on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11323)|
| 3:08:50| and it doesn't have to be specifics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11330)|
| 3:08:52| but some general direction on what you are looking for when it comes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11332)|
| 3:08:57| Because when we began, we had a ban on billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11337)|
| 3:09:02| and we had a ban on MPCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11342)|
| 3:09:04| and then we added a ban on converting traditional billboards to electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11344)|
| 3:09:11| billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11351)|
| 3:09:12| and then the Metropolitan Planning Commission made a recommendation that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| consider an incentive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| Now, those are four things at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11358)|
| 3:09:20| Now we're throwing use-on-review into the mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11360)|
| 3:09:24| So it may not be my position to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11364)|
| 3:09:28| but if Mark or someone from MPC would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11368)|
| 3:09:35| please give me some direction, what are some general guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11375)|
| 3:09:41| Are we looking for these things to be proposed in the alternative?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11381)|
| 3:09:48| Should they be one ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11388)|
| 3:09:53| What parts of the ordinance should have a use-on-review condition established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11393)|
| 3:09:58| or attached to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11398)|
| 3:10:02| I think if we just throw it back to the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11402)|
| 3:10:06| there's a good chance that we get something that we're going to want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| change substantially before we vote on it or move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11409)|
| 3:10:14| Well, I guess I would, since I'm the maker of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11414)|
| 3:10:17| and I'd ask anyone else to chime in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11417)|
| 3:10:20| I don't think we're asking a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| I mean, it might be a big step, but it's not a lot of detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11423)|
| 3:10:26| I think it's just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11426)|
| 3:10:27| In 101, which in this particular one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11427)|
| 3:10:30| this deals with the conventional billboards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| we're asking for a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| I think it's that simple to have MPC do a use-on-review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11435)|
| 3:10:39| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11439)|
| 3:10:40| Is it another step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11440)|
| 3:10:42| It's another step, but I think it's an important step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11442)|
| 3:10:45| I think this step will involve both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| You can present why you feel it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11449)|
| 3:10:52| The opposite side can show up or not show up and present why they oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11452)|
| 3:10:59| And then MPC, who's kind of the gatekeeper of all things zoning, can vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11459)|
| 3:11:05| And there will be a process set up that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11465)|
| 3:11:08| Again, I remember hearing, I don't know who it was from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| that that was amenable to the industry during these dialogues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11471)|
| 3:11:17| You know, is it another step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11477)|
| 3:11:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11480)|
| 3:11:21| Is it a huge step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| I would say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| But, you know, there are unintended consequences, as the gentleman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11485)|
| 3:11:29| I mean, when you have lights shining across the bay, across the river into your neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11489)|
| 3:11:34| I think all these things need to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11494)|
| 3:11:38| and looked at by the folks who do that, who understand how lighting affects a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11498)|
| 3:11:42| who understands how traffic patterns might be impacted by a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11502)|
| 3:11:50| And to go back and say, no, I dare say most things get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11510)|
| 3:11:55| So I wouldn't look at this as a negative hurdle, like an insurmountable wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11515)|
| 3:12:00| It's another step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11520)|
| 3:12:02| But it's to give us a good product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11522)|
| 3:12:04| It's to have us end up with something positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11524)|
| 3:12:08| So for this one, I think it's fairly simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| I think it's we're asking MPC to have this ordinance come back to say that things will come back with use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11531)|
| 3:12:19| And my last statement is, from what I heard from zonings, there's no real review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11539)|
| 3:12:24| I mean, they're going to look at the engineering aspects of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11544)|
| 3:12:28| They're not looking at the other side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11548)|
| 3:12:32| They're looking at, does this meet, you know, can this fit in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11552)|
| 3:12:38| I don't see a lot of that, you know, neighborhood and development piece of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11558)|
| 3:12:43| And that's not their job, I don't feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| Is it in the right zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| Paperwork filled out properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| Yes, it will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11569)|
| 3:12:50| So I don't, I guess I'll argue a little bit to say that we have enough processes in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11570)|
| 3:12:55| So that's, I don't know if I answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11575)|
| 3:12:59| Mr. Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11579)|
| 3:13:00| Is that enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11580)|
| 3:13:01| Yeah, Mr. Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11581)|
| 3:13:02| Is that sufficiently specific for MPC to return a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11582)|
| 3:13:11| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| The use on review process is in place to provide the planning commission some discretion on a set of uses that are listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11594)|
| 3:13:25| That discretion is opposed to a set of regulations that are measured in square feet or feet in height or nits in brightness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11605)|
| 3:13:37| They are written in terms of being in harmony with the surrounding property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11617)|
| 3:13:43| and not in opposition to the stated goals of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11623)|
| 3:13:49| So they are very, very general and very discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11629)|
| 3:13:54| On the other hand, MPC decisions on uses permitted on review are appealable to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11634)|
| 3:14:04| and I can't remember one ever being appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11644)|
| 3:14:09| So I think we do a pretty good job of applying as much technical expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11649)|
| 3:14:17| and regulatory language to the use on review process as possible within that framework of discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11657)|
| 3:14:26| Now, we may be able to add some criteria for citing of billboards and citing of EMC that doesn't currently exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11666)|
| 3:14:37| And that could be subject to a whole lot of debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11677)|
| 3:14:42| We probably want to have a public meeting or two to talk about that kind of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11682)|
| 3:14:47| if we're going to add it to the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11687)|
| 3:14:50| Rather than just the general criteria for all uses permitted on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11690)|
| 3:14:53| there's an entire section of the zoning ordinance that provides additional criteria for uses permitted on review by type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11693)|
| 3:15:03| And billboards and EMCs may be a use that warrants additional criteria above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11703)|
| 3:15:13| and beyond the regulations that we currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11713)|
| 3:15:20| I'm understanding that rather than prohibiting new billboards in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11720)|
| 3:15:26| with this particular ordinance amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| you would rather have that listed as a permitted use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11728)|
| 3:15:34| or a use permitted on review in the CA, CB, CH, and I zone districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11734)|
| 3:15:42| Technically, that's a pretty simple amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| but we may want to augment it with some criteria to take a little bit of the discretion out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11745)|
| 3:15:52| and at least provide a framework for the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11752)|
| 3:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11757)|
| 3:15:58| Thank you, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11758)|
| 3:15:59| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11759)|
| 3:16:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11761)|
| 3:16:11| Whenever anything goes through MPC under use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11771)|
| 3:16:17| that's the final authority unless you go to the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11777)|
| 3:16:24| It takes the commission totally out of the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11784)|
| 3:16:28| There'd be nothing coming back to this commission to say, yea or nay, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11788)|
| 3:16:35| So we need to be very careful how this is worded and how it's set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11795)|
| 3:16:43| I don't see why that we can't have the two or three things that we want put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11803)|
| 3:16:49| send it to MPC, have them vet it and get it back to us the way that we want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11809)|
| 3:16:59| and still have control over the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11819)|
| 3:17:05| It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11825)|
| 3:17:08| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| I was going to talk a little bit about that because we would, if we put use on review in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11830)|
| 3:17:15| we lose any appeal coming to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11835)|
| 3:17:18| But I'm looking and thinking about strategy and the best way to do what we want to try to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11838)|
| 3:17:27| But whether or not we defer this or withdrawing it allows the opening up on the 31st of permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11847)|
| 3:17:38| If you defer it, you kind of close that door a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| But even if you vote on it in an affirmative as it sits right now, you still close the door on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11863)|
| 3:17:49| because you have pending legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11869)|
| 3:17:50| This is only the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| And so I think deferral is the best, although I would rather withdraw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11872)|
| 3:17:57| and kind of go back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11877)|
| 3:17:59| I think deferral is the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11879)|
| 3:18:01| It's going to give us our best outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11881)|
| 3:18:03| I'm not for as it is written and would vote against it as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11883)|
| 3:18:07| But if we're going to make some changes and review, you know, the state is already in review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11887)|
| 3:18:15| and has some legislation pending this year as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| And so I think it would be until we review that legislation and the possibilities of that passing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| and also I think although I want them withdrawn, I think deferral is the best method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11904)|
| 3:18:32| because either way, deferral or voting in the affirmative, it still puts the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11912)|
| 3:18:37| for lack of a better term, it puts the stop on the permitting for a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11917)|
| 3:18:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11924)|
| 3:18:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11925)|
| 3:18:46| Thank you, Mr. Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11926)|
| 3:18:47| I don't see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11927)|
| 3:18:50| So we have a substitute motion before us to defer for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11930)|
| 3:18:57| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11937)|
| 3:18:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11939)|

| 3:19:11| All right, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11951)|
| 3:19:17| Seven, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11957)|
| 3:19:21| Okay, so the vote is seven, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11961)|
| 3:19:23| So this will be deferred for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11963)|
| 3:19:28| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11968)|
| 3:19:34| Can you just say ditto and let us vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11974)|
| 3:19:38| Hopefully it will be shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=11978)|

| 3:21:19| I'd like to move to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| but also to amend this to ban all new digital billboards, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12081)|
| 3:21:26| which is not in the ordinance, both the conversion and new digitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12086)|

| 3:21:35| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12095)|
| 3:21:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12096)|
| 3:21:38| If I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12098)|
| 3:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12100)|
| 3:21:41| Mr. Anders, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12101)|
| 3:21:42| I'd like to make a substitute motion that follows the last two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12102)|
| 3:21:47| I think there's two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12107)|
| 3:21:48| One is it's new state regulations I'd like to read over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| and I think it's all a part of the same discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| You know, we are all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12114)|
| 3:21:55| We broke them all apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12115)|
| 3:21:56| Now we're, you know, I think the discussion should be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12116)|
| 3:22:01| And also, or electronic messaging center signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12121)|
| 3:22:06| I mean, so it puts together a lot of the same language as the previous ordinance ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12126)|
| 3:22:12| So I'd like to make a motion that we treat this one like we did the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12132)|
| 3:22:16| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12136)|
| 3:22:17| Do we hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12137)|
| 3:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12143)|
| 3:22:24| Failing to hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12144)|
| 3:22:25| That substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12145)|
| 3:22:26| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12146)|
| 3:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12147)|
| 3:22:28| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12148)|
| 3:22:31| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12151)|
| 3:22:32| Further discussion to the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12152)|
| 3:22:38| All in favor of the substitute motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12158)|
| 3:22:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130128?start=12160)|
