| 2:49:43| because a girl thought she would be complicit with the overdose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| And it took a maid at a hotel to discover that he was there and died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10187)|
| 2:49:53| So, you know, those are active drug users, and we need to be concerned about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10193)|
| 2:49:59| But I think we need to distinguish between active drug users and recovering addicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10199)|
| 2:50:06| I mean, you know, I'll use a little humor with Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10206)|
| 2:50:11| When he was racing up and down to Nashville at the state legislature, and he was caught speeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10211)|
| 2:50:17| you know, we don't house a state trooper at his house overnight to make sure he doesn't speed in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10217)|
| 2:50:23| I mean, these are not criminals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10223)|
| 2:50:25| You know, these are folks asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10225)|
| 2:50:28| And how, as we, as a community, how can we not offer to help the people that are asking for help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10228)|
| 2:50:36| And that is my deepest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10236)|
| 2:50:38| They're already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10238)|
| 2:50:40| These folks want help, and it's up to our community, I think, to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10240)|
| 2:50:45| I want to make a couple of other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| There was some comment about the credibility of the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10248)|
| 2:50:58| You know, I think we're here to evaluate the use and not the user.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10258)|
| 2:51:04| You know, if we start getting into the quality of the user, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10264)|
| 2:51:09| I may argue when we have a drive-thru subject to use on review that Chick-fil-A should be the only one to get a drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10269)|
| 2:51:18| because they outperform everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10278)|
| 2:51:20| So, you know, we can't judge their background or performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10280)|
| 2:51:27| And, you know, as a landlord, I have at least two recovery-type uses in our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10287)|
| 2:51:35| One is within a block of Emerald Youth off of Western Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| We've not had one complaint there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10301)|
| 2:51:43| They're right next door to a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10303)|
| 2:51:46| Not one complaint there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10306)|
| 2:51:47| I would be more concerned about the ones not asking for help than I would be the ones asking for help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10307)|
| 2:51:54| So, you know, I feel like we're treating folks that want help like we did the AIDS victims back in the 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10314)|
| 2:52:02| You know, we don't want anything to do with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10322)|
| 2:52:04| And if you listen to folks that are experts in this area, such as the Metro Drug Coalition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10324)|
| 2:52:11| the most difficult part of getting them reestablished, it's not the detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10331)|
| 2:52:19| It's the reengagement to community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10339)|
| 2:52:21| So we hear it time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10341)|
| 2:52:24| We think it's a noble cause, but it's just not appropriate here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10344)|
| 2:52:28| But it's not there where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10348)|
| 2:52:31| And I just want you to know that I support it, and I would like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10351)|
| 2:52:36| And I want to add one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10356)|
| 2:52:38| You know, we approved this under use on review in April right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10358)|
| 2:52:42| How do we look at a contiguous property and say, well, it's okay there, but it's not okay here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10362)|
| 2:52:49| It doesn't seem consistent with what we're doing as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10369)|
| 2:52:53| I'm not judging our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10373)|
| 2:52:54| I'm just saying we ought to be thoughtful when we make that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| And I want to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10381)|
| 2:53:07| Okay, I'll yield if it's okay with the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| If I could come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10390)|
| 2:53:11| I think she has a question that has to do with my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10391)|
| 2:53:14| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10394)|
| 2:53:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| Commissioner again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10396)|
| 2:53:17| So my question is about Condition 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10397)|
| 2:53:20| Well, I'll start off by echoing everything that you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10400)|
| 2:53:23| because we've seen quite a few cases similar to this over the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10403)|
| 2:53:27| And every community that it comes up, people say it needs to be somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10407)|
| 2:53:32| And it's like, well, okay, so where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10412)|
| 2:53:36| So I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10416)|
| 2:53:38| Condition 7, you were referencing Section 4.105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10418)|
| 2:53:43| Is that because they're calling it a recovery house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10423)|
| 2:53:47| Like if they called it a boarding house, for example, would that not apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10427)|
| 2:53:51| And I'm just asking because we've had a couple of cases come up in the past six months that called it a boarding house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10431)|
| 2:53:57| And I don't recall that condition being applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| Maybe it was, but I don't recall seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10440)|
| 2:54:04| Something similar to what you were saying at our agenda review Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10444)|
| 2:54:09| if we're looking at recovery houses and boarding houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10449)|
| 2:54:13| obviously where they're at and the conditions factor in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10453)|
| 2:54:17| but we do need to make sure that the playing field is level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10457)|
| 2:54:20| so we're not requesting a letter from them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10460)|
| 2:54:23| and then the next boarding house, we're not requesting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10463)|
| 2:54:26| because they call it boarding versus recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10466)|
| 2:54:28| So that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10468)|
| 2:54:29| Yeah, this is specifically noticed as a proposed use, recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10469)|
| 2:54:35| So that is what is on the agenda and has been properly noticed for consideration today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10475)|
| 2:54:41| So then is that just because of the word recovery versus boarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10481)|
| 2:54:46| Since in other cases they were offering recovery, they just didn't call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10486)|
| 2:54:52| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10493)|
| 2:54:54| I know that word is vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10494)|
| 2:54:56| It's been determined that the use that they are proposing is recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10496)|
| 2:55:01| and so that's why we're using the standards for use on review approval for recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10501)|
| 2:55:07| and the letter is specific to that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10507)|
| 2:55:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10510)|
| 2:55:11| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10511)|
| 2:55:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| Before you make a motion, Commissioner, let me, I guess Commissioner Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| I mean, Eddie Smith has got a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10520)|
| 2:55:22| I'm not as good looking as Scott Smith, so we'll just have to stay with Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10522)|
| 2:55:26| I want to follow up on Commissioner Roth's line of question for counsel for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10526)|
| 2:55:33| With what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10533)|
| 2:55:35| would this allow the applicant to change to a treatment facility where they could go to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10535)|
| 2:55:41| and get licensed without it coming back for a different use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10541)|
| 2:55:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10546)|
| 2:55:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10547)|
| 2:55:48| They'd have to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10548)|
| 2:55:49| I wanted to make sure that was correct, I assume, but I just wanted to get that out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10549)|
| 2:55:53| that they could not do anything other than this if we pass this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10553)|
| 2:56:00| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| Am I correct that there was an error made in April that if we are to be consistent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10563)|
| 2:56:11| there should have been a request for a letter when that was approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10571)|
| 2:56:17| The use on review approval in April had a condition that they had to meet all the requirements of the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10577)|
| 2:56:25| you know, the requirements of the zoning ordinance and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10585)|
| 2:56:28| It just wasn't as specific as saying, hey, we have to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10588)|
| 2:56:33| You know, just put them on notice, like during permitting, we have to have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10593)|
| 2:56:37| But, you know, if conditions were broad enough, we could say you have to have that letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10597)|
| 2:56:43| and that's still the intent of the zoning is to have that letter or licensing, one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10603)|
| 2:56:50| So how would the letter fit in with the motion that Commissioner Hill has made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10610)|
| 2:56:55| My motion will not include the letter because it should, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10615)|
| 2:57:00| it's just like these other conditions that you have to comply with the local ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10620)|
| 2:57:06| You have to comply with the state ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| If there are any, if there aren't any, then you're complying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10628)|
| 2:57:12| So I don't know why we have to force, you know, this letter that the state mayor may not send.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10632)|
| 2:57:19| And if I'm confused, please clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| Commissioner Hill, it is identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10642)|
| 2:57:24| As Mike said, we called it out specifically because there was so much discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10644)|
| 2:57:31| But it is specifically called out in 4.105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| Could you read that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| I've got it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10656)|
| 2:57:37| It is, it's a Part F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10657)|
| 2:57:41| The facility and use shall comply with all applicable county, state, and federal codes and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10661)|
| 2:57:47| The applicant shall provide a letter of certification of final approval from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10667)|
| 2:57:53| or a letter from the state stating how the proposed use is such that the state does not require a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10673)|
| 2:58:01| That's the language in the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| So do we do that on all uses on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| Yes, it's specific to this particular use and review for recovery housing, 4.105.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10686)|
| 2:58:13| Okay, so I'll add that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| And that's the origin of the condition that was added by staff in Part, I think that was 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10696)|
| 2:58:24| 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10704)|
| 2:58:26| It's already in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10706)|
| 2:58:27| It's number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10709)|
| 2:58:30| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10711)|
| 2:58:36| Chair Phillips, thank you for being so gracious with allowing me to speak here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| But I'd like to make the motion to approve per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10721)|
| 2:58:51| And that's subject to those now 7 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10731)|
| 2:58:57| We have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Hill, seconded by Commissioner Eddie Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10737)|
| 2:59:02| to approve the recovery housing facility for 40 residential units per staff's recommendation with the 7 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10742)|
| 2:59:11| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10753)|
| 2:59:14| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10754)|
| 2:59:15| Hearing none, the motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10755)|
| 2:59:23| Next is a development plan, use on review, agenda item number, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10763)|
| 2:59:30| We need to go to 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10770)|
| 2:59:39| Item 26 was removed from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| This is where we require one motion for food trucks, use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10783)|
| 2:59:47| The applicant is Dina Middleton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10787)|
| 2:59:50| The location, south side of Middlebrook Pike, item number 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10790)|
| 2:59:55| Size tract is 3.16 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10795)|
| 2:59:59| Zoning is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| OB office, medical and related services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| Proposed use, restaurant, food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10804)|
| 3:00:09| Staff recommendation, approve the request to allow up to 3 food trucks to be parked at 9036 Middlebrook Pike, subject to 2 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10809)|
| 3:00:20| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10820)|
| 3:00:22| I am the applicant, Dina Middleton, 9111 Cross Park Drive, D200 Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10822)|
| 3:00:28| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10828)|
| 3:00:32| We have, would you like to go first or would you like the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10832)|
| 3:00:36| I would defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10836)|
| 3:00:38| Please state your name and address, please, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10838)|
| 3:00:42| My name is Joe Drummer, 8915 Ripon Circle, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10842)|
| 3:00:50| I just wanted to speak and I got my little postcard in the mail about if you had any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10850)|
| 3:01:00| On this property, if you look at the map, you can see that my neighborhood is Crestwood Hills, which is on the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10860)|
| 3:01:13| My fence backs up to theirs, and there's a line of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10873)|
| 3:01:19| On the west side, you'll see a condominium complex of about 40 to 50 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10879)|
| 3:01:27| And on the east side is a click funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10887)|
| 3:01:31| And my concern is the noise snowball, if I can use that term, that as this property moved back from Middlebrook, it encroached upon the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10891)|
| 3:01:48| And I kept hearing from some of these, I've been listening the last three hours, that cohabitate between business and between neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10908)|
| 3:01:57| And because it's pushed back into the neighborhood, I believe that the food trucks are going to, more people will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10917)|
| 3:02:07| And the big issue for me, as I put in the letter that you should have, is that they have, it's just, the noise has gotten bigger and bigger over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10927)|
| 3:02:21| And specifically, the noise, they have amplified noise, amplified music, starting on Saturday afternoon, mid-afternoon, it goes to about 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10941)|
| 3:02:32| And then it starts back up on Sunday afternoon, mid-afternoon, and goes to about 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10952)|
| 3:02:37| And so it's really becoming a problem, just the fact of being able to relax in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10957)|
| 3:02:45| And so that's my concern, is just that the food trucks are going to add to the snowball noise problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10965)|
| 3:02:54| And I appreciate any advice that I could get on how to resolve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10974)|
| 3:03:02| Thank you, Mr. Kramer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10982)|
| 3:03:06| Forgive me, I may call you Your Honor again, but I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10989)|
| 3:03:10| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10990)|
| 3:03:11| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| We are only asking for permission of zero to three food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10993)|
| 3:03:19| They are going to be in the CN zone area, which will be in the front of the plot of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=10999)|
| 3:03:28| I think before there was a little confusion about where that ended, and now the applicants, those property owners know that they need to be closer to Middlebrook Pike itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11008)|
| 3:03:42| Food trucks are, to my knowledge, not playing any music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11022)|
| 3:03:46| Now, if somebody's out there on the picnic tables playing music, you know, it's a family operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11026)|
| 3:03:54| There's picnic tables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| They close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11037)|
| 3:03:58| The food trucks are only there until 8 p.m. every night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11038)|
| 3:04:02| They're to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11042)|
| 3:04:03| They only are there from 12 to 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11043)|
| 3:04:07| Any time, there may be zero food trucks there or no more than three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11047)|
| 3:04:13| So our request would be that it's just supplementing the Hay Bear, the Bobo Cafe, which does not have food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11053)|
| 3:04:22| This was something that they were looking at during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11062)|
| 3:04:26| The families love to come out and be able to get some food in addition to a Bobo tea or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11066)|
| 3:04:35| So as far as the noise level, I think that's just part of day-to-day living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11075)|
| 3:04:42| We're right on Middlebrook Pike, and like I said, it's up closer to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11082)|
| 3:04:48| We have three different ingresses and egresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11088)|
| 3:04:54| I think it wouldn't, it just, it complements, which is the definition of a CN property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11094)|
| 3:05:00| It just complements what's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11100)|
| 3:05:04| And that would be our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11104)|
| 3:05:07| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11107)|
| 3:05:10| No, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11110)|
| 3:05:13| Commissioner Hill or, let's see, Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11113)|
| 3:05:17| I'm trying to figure out whose light is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11117)|
| 3:05:19| Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11119)|
| 3:05:20| What would the noise ordinance dictate about noise from like a certain time to a certain time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11120)|
| 3:05:27| Is there a cutoff point where there's quiet hours built into the city or county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11127)|
| 3:05:32| This would be in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11132)|
| 3:05:35| I'm not sure which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11135)|
| 3:05:37| It's in the building code, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11137)|
| 3:05:39| I don't know if our colleagues here can reference it, but we could pull it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11139)|
| 3:05:44| Yeah, I was looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11144)|
| 3:05:47| It's in Chapter 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11147)|
| 3:05:49| It's actually, like Amy said, it was in the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11149)|
| 3:05:52| It's from commercial use allows, it depends on the hours of the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11152)|
| 3:05:58| The weighted sound pressure is less after 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11158)|
| 3:06:04| Obviously, the type of events that this gentleman is referring to are after our normal business hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| so we usually treat these as disturbing of the peace and allow the sheriff's office to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11169)|
| 3:06:17| And I can provide you a copy of the code, sir, that any time after 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11177)|
| 3:06:21| there's a limit of 75 decibels that, if it succeeds, they can be held in violation of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11181)|
| 3:06:28| So up until 10 p.m., people are pretty much good to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11188)|
| 3:06:33| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11193)|
| 3:06:35| It's actually, there's two different, up to, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., they're allowed up to 80 decibels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11195)|
| 3:06:42| so they're allowed a little more noise during that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11202)|
| 3:06:45| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11205)|
| 3:06:46| I wanted to point out, I just got on Hay Bear's Instagram, and they do have live music on the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11206)|
| 3:06:52| so I think that's what you're possibly referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11212)|
| 3:06:55| I'm sorry, say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11215)|
| 3:06:56| They have live music at the food truck park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| There's a schedule showing Fridays and Saturdays, 6 to 8, and they have different performers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11218)|
| 3:07:03| so maybe that's what you're hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11223)|
| 3:07:05| Yeah, it's amplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11225)|
| 3:07:06| It goes to about 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11226)|
| 3:07:07| It's amplified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11227)|
| 3:07:08| And again, if you think about that, there's, again, 40 to 50 on the west side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11228)|
| 3:07:13| I mean, right up against the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| I mean, I was trying to how to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11235)|
| 3:07:18| A UT baseball player could throw a baseball and hit 50 houses, 50 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| So that's like 150 people that are having to listen to this music up to amplified music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11242)|
| 3:07:28| It's not just crowd noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11248)|
| 3:07:29| It's amplified music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11249)|
| 3:07:31| 150 people, I would estimate, have to listen to that to 8 o'clock from mid-afternoon to 8 o'clock every Friday and every Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11251)|
| 3:07:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11260)|
| 3:07:41| I'm not making an observation, or I'm just making an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11261)|
| 3:07:44| I'm not giving an opinion, just throwing things out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11264)|
| 3:07:47| I would just like for you to say we're here on a use site for food trucks, not about the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| I mean, we'd certainly be glad to discuss that with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| I'm just here to ask that they can rotate in some food trucks to supplement their cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11277)|
| 3:08:03| They close, even the latest, on Fridays and Saturdays at 930.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11283)|
| 3:08:08| The whole place closes down, and the food trucks are closed at 8 p.m. every night of the week, and they don't show up until 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11288)|
| 3:08:17| Like I said, I don't know that the food trucks are causing any noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11297)|
| 3:08:23| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11303)|
| 3:08:24| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| Yes, I understand this is used on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| I'm just curious, can someone quickly tell me when it was zoned CN, how long it's been commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11310)|
| 3:08:38| It's been zoned, at least since they zoned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11318)|
| 3:08:45| It was July of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11328)|
| 3:08:50| All right, Chair, we'll entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11330)|
| 3:08:54| I'll make that motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11337)|
| 3:08:58| We have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Roth to approve food trucks per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11338)|
| 3:09:06| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11348)|

| 3:10:23| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11423)|
| 3:10:30| Here on behalf of the applicant, Crescent at Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11430)|
| 3:10:33| What this amounts to is essentially a phase two of the previous approval back in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11433)|
| 3:10:41| which included a multifamily development on the majority of the acres, approximately 20 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11441)|
| 3:10:47| With that approval back in 2018, there was a portion of this larger part of the tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11447)|
| 3:10:55| approximately five acres, was reserved and set aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11455)|
| 3:10:58| It was noted in the staff report that that was going to be the anticipated use would be for an independent senior living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11458)|
| 3:11:05| At the time, the demand was very high for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11465)|
| 3:11:09| Since then, as a result of COVID, naturally, that industry has really fallen in demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11469)|
| 3:11:16| What has not fallen in demand is the apartment developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11476)|
| 3:11:21| In fact, this first phase, the 246 units that were developed, the final CO was issued in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11481)|
| 3:11:30| and it's already at 100% occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11490)|
| 3:11:32| There's no sign of this demand for not only houses to be purchased, but also residences to be rented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11492)|
| 3:11:44| The apartment demand has been strong for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| At the time of the 2018 approval, there was a traffic impact study that was conducted based on the 249 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11507)|
| 3:11:55| based on the potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| It also included the potential senior living, which was just under approximately 200 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11517)|
| 3:12:02| and as well factored in the planned commercial tract that's at the front of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11522)|
| 3:12:08| at the front of this property along Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11528)|
| 3:12:13| That traffic study has been updated, and all of the improvements that were required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11533)|
| 3:12:18| and that have been installed from the 2018 are still seen to be sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11538)|
| 3:12:22| for the additional Phase 2 development for the multifamily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11542)|
| 3:12:26| which consists of 78 units, two separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11546)|
| 3:12:30| Most of the conditions as far as sidewalks, amenities, and things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11550)|
| 3:12:38| have already been completed as a part of Phase 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| This would essentially just be continuing along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11561)|
| 3:12:45| The roads are already installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11565)|
| 3:12:46| We have two separate accesses, one from Westland Drive and one from Ebenezer Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11566)|
| 3:12:54| I believe this is an appropriate extension of this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| It's not going to cause any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11577)|
| 3:12:58| Recording in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11578)|
| 3:13:02| I think it's every time something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11582)|
| 3:13:04| It must be me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11584)|
| 3:13:07| It's not going to cause any additional impact on the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11587)|
| 3:13:13| As noted for the planned commercial tract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| it's a shopping center design consisting of five individual spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11595)|
| 3:13:21| and it's just absolutely perfect for this type of extension of the apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11601)|
| 3:13:25| It will be a neighborhood bistro, sit-down restaurant, a local pizzeria concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11605)|
| 3:13:34| It will be a cave room as well in one of the spots, a dentist office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11614)|
| 3:13:37| as well as a nail salon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11617)|
| 3:13:40| Perfect location for that, not only for the surrounding subdivision residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11620)|
| 3:13:43| but also the density that you have directly on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11623)|
| 3:13:48| I believe this is exactly kind of the concept around planned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11628)|
| 3:13:51| with planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| As noted in the staff report, the use is compatible with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11633)|
| 3:13:59| It complies with the general plan, sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11639)|
| 3:14:03| It is in harmony with the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11643)|
| 3:14:11| It provides, as required in there, provides for open space, common area, sidewalks, amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11651)|
| 3:14:18| With that being said, we ask that you follow, request that you follow staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11658)|
| 3:14:22| and approve phase two of this cohesive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11662)|
| 3:14:27| and approve the development of 78 additional apartment units in the two buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11667)|
| 3:14:32| and subject to any conditions that are set forth in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11672)|
| 3:14:35| Thank you, Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11675)|
| 3:14:38| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11678)|
| 3:14:42| There is one other person, sir, so be cognizant of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11682)|
| 3:14:45| You have a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11685)|
| 3:14:47| Your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11687)|
| 3:14:49| My name is Roland Shankles, 8800 Westland Drive, Knoxville 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11689)|
| 3:14:58| Our property is the bed and breakfast that's right behind where Mr. Murphy's development is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11698)|
| 3:15:07| And I have no problem with Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11707)|
| 3:15:09| I haven't met him, but he's been a good neighbor as far as during the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11709)|
| 3:15:14| I'm also sympathetic to the fact that people are moving into Knoxville at a crazy rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11714)|
| 3:15:21| that it seems to be a very popular place for New Yorkers and Californians and people from Illinois.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11721)|
| 3:15:27| And that's all fine to an extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11727)|
| 3:15:32| As far as our development is concerned, we've got 15 1⁄2 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11732)|
| 3:15:35| and we're using it for bed and breakfast and for a wedding venue and the apartments that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11735)|
| 3:15:42| When the apartments were approved, when that plan was approved by the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11742)|
| 3:15:47| to have the one section for apartments, another section for assisted living, made perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11747)|
| 3:15:54| It seems like a lot of these cases that I've been sitting here listening to have to do with density of population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11754)|
| 3:16:00| that you can have apartments and you can coexist with apartments and everything's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11760)|
| 3:16:07| Kids, dogs, whatever it is, in-laws, additional residents, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11767)|
| 3:16:15| But when the density becomes too great in an area like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11775)|
| 3:16:20| which had very few apartments in it originally at the corner of Westland and Ebenezer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11780)|
| 3:16:29| then in my mind that density between the traffic, the security lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11789)|
| 3:16:35| which need to stay on all night because you've got so many people living in such a small area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11795)|
| 3:16:43| We've got a wedding venue and we've got security lights blasting into our area, which is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11803)|
| 3:16:49| We can deal with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| But there comes a point when it's no longer fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11811)|
| 3:16:55| The second point was diversity, that the seniors that have been so impacted by COVID and by the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11815)|
| 3:17:02| we've all been impacted by the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11822)|
| 3:17:05| But the seniors, to me the assisted living made perfect sense because of that diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11825)|
| 3:17:12| But to have a place for seniors that would be convenient to family members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11832)|
| 3:17:20| and that would be just commodious to their living makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11840)|
| 3:17:25| The nearest, I don't know if it's assisted living or skilled nursing, is Little Creek down on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11845)|
| 3:17:31| And that place has got a 10-year backlog as far as demand goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11851)|
| 3:17:38| The traffic is hard for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11858)|
| 3:17:42| Traffic is almost anecdotal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11862)|
| 3:17:45| If you've been to Nashville lately, trips that used to take 10 minutes take 40 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11865)|
| 3:17:51| just because of the density of the population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11871)|
| 3:17:54| And that's where planning comes into things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11874)|
| 3:17:59| And that's what I would be asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11879)|
| 3:18:02| I don't know about the 100 percent occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11882)|
| 3:18:04| If the apartments that Mr. Murphy has now are 100 percent occupied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11884)|
| 3:18:08| some of them are disguised as dark apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11888)|
| 3:18:13| The parking lots are not full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11893)|
| 3:18:15| The buildings don't seem to be full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11895)|
| 3:18:18| But that's just me talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| He very well may have contracts to fill those apartments completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11900)|
| 3:18:23| And I'm sure from what the attorney said, they must have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11903)|
| 3:18:27| All I would be pushing for is my third point was that the use-on-review sign was placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11907)|
| 3:18:35| The property is on Ebenezer, a five-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| The use-on-review sign was put on Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11919)|
| 3:18:42| Everybody that I've talked to, maybe half a dozen people or so, nobody knew about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11922)|
| 3:18:48| I knew about it only because I got a card in the mail because our property adjoins this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11928)|
| 3:18:54| So those are my three points, and now I've made them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11934)|
| 3:18:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11938)|
| 3:18:59| Thank you, Mr. Schnekel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11939)|
| 3:19:04| It's cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11944)|

| 3:19:14| I'm here today because I live directly behind the piece of property that is going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11954)|
| 3:19:21| which proposed is the apartment complex, the new apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11961)|
| 3:19:26| And when I say directly behind it, it will almost be in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11966)|
| 3:19:31| And the assisted living was approved, as he stated, in the first go-around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11971)|
| 3:19:36| which was basically sold to the Farrington residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11976)|
| 3:19:40| We accepted that because it was a one-level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11980)|
| 3:19:43| It would be quiet after 9 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11983)|
| 3:19:45| There wouldn't be traffic going around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| There wouldn't be people hanging out the balconies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| There wouldn't be dogs barking all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11990)|
| 3:19:53| So in our mind, that was a good, you know, I guess, I'm nervous, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=11993)|
| 3:20:01| a tradeoff as far as we'll take the apartments, we'll get the assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12001)|
| 3:20:05| I would like to make another point to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12005)|
| 3:20:07| I don't know if he's ever had to look for assisted living for his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12007)|
| 3:20:10| I recently had to look for assisted living for my mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12010)|
| 3:20:13| It is not full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12013)|
| 3:20:14| I mean, everything is full in West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12014)|
| 3:20:17| I was almost having to go to Powell to place my mother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12017)|
| 3:20:20| We need assisted living facilities for our senior residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12020)|
| 3:20:26| They're aging and they are more in need every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12026)|
| 3:20:30| And I'm pretty sure that maybe someone has had experience on the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12030)|
| 3:20:34| with elderly parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| It's difficult, but when it's, you have to add a two-hour travel time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12036)|
| 3:20:41| to go see that person, it's even more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| So I would ask all of you, if you're going to approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12045)|
| 3:20:49| that you would at least make them build a landscape barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12049)|
| 3:20:55| that would protect the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| I'm not the only one that is going to directly back up to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12057)|
| 3:21:01| so that we don't see the lights coming in and out all night long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12061)|
| 3:21:04| that we don't see, you know, the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12064)|
| 3:21:09| and that it would be something that would block us 12 months a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12069)|
| 3:21:14| Evergreens, the noise level is another concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12074)|
| 3:21:19| I mean, Farrington is a quiet residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12079)|
| 3:21:24| My neighbor to the right of me has been there for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12084)|
| 3:21:27| The lady to the left of me has been over 30 years or 27 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12087)|
| 3:21:32| or whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| But I would love for you all to consider where we're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12094)|
| 3:21:37| I know there's a lot of smiles, but that's my home and that's my peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12097)|
| 3:21:43| And they're wanting to take that away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12106)|
| 3:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12107)|
| 3:21:51| Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12111)|
| 3:21:53| Just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12113)|
| 3:21:56| It may not sound like a huge difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12116)|
| 3:21:58| but what was slated to go there was independent senior living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12118)|
| 3:22:02| not assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12122)|
| 3:22:04| There is a pretty substantial difference in those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12124)|
| 3:22:08| The independent senior living, everybody, for the most part, still has vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12128)|
| 3:22:12| It is just geared and activities are geared towards a senior class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12132)|
| 3:22:20| It is not assisted living in the sense that assisted living mostly has some on-site medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| and treatment to handle the care of some of those patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12145)|
| 3:22:30| So it was not assisted living as assisted living is defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12150)|
| 3:22:37| As far as the landscaping and buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12157)|
| 3:22:42| where she spoke about where the residential houses are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12162)|
| 3:22:44| there's already a substantial mature tree buffer there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12164)|
| 3:22:48| and the landscape plan also does provide for additional inclusion of vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12168)|
| 3:22:54| and landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12174)|
| 3:22:55| So that will help to mitigate those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12175)|
| 3:22:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12179)|
| 3:23:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12180)|
| 3:23:04| Real quick, please, Mr. Shankles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12184)|
| 3:23:07| And I forgot to go to law school, but assisted living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12187)|
| 3:23:11| all I'm saying is senior living is what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12191)|
| 3:23:14| I'm sorry if I used the wrong term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12194)|
| 3:23:16| especially the way it's changing with Medicare rules now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12196)|
| 3:23:20| The landscape shielding that you can do with landscaping is terrific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12200)|
| 3:23:29| For my children and my grandchildren, it takes, well, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12209)|
| 3:23:34| it takes 20 years for the trees to grow up to where they really accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12214)|
| 3:23:37| what you would like for them to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| That's all I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| Real quick, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| Independent living would probably more than likely be one story versus three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12223)|
| 3:23:48| That's going to be overlooking into my backyard and into my bedroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| and living room and deck and sunroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12231)|
| 3:23:54| And as far as the landscape barrier goes, there is trees there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12234)|
| 3:23:59| but when the leaves fall, there is nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12239)|
| 3:24:03| So there's no barrier in the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12243)|
| 3:24:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12246)|
| 3:24:07| The Chair will recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12247)|
| 3:24:11| And this question is for Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12251)|
| 3:24:14| I'm not looking to add any conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| I just want to know if your client would be willing to get the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| and names of the two people who spoke to see if he could work with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12260)|
| 3:24:24| You know, as Mr. Murphy said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12264)|
| 3:24:26| maybe we should just change the slogan to light shield, stop light pollution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12266)|
| 3:24:31| You know, maybe there's some remedies that he could take on as a good neighbor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12271)|
| 3:24:36| just to help with some of the issues that were brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12276)|
| 3:24:40| just so we don't have to go through the rigmarole of putting it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| But I just want a head nod commitment that he would at least sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12282)|
| 3:24:46| and talk and meet with the neighbors to work on that issue for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12286)|
| 3:24:51| Yes, good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| The Chair recognizes Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12294)|
| 3:24:58| Yeah, I guess this is for staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12298)|
| 3:25:00| Was that one of the conditions of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12300)|
| 3:25:02| was that they put a one-level independent living building back there near the neighbors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12302)|
| 3:25:08| Or do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12308)|
| 3:25:11| No, I believe that was part of their request at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12311)|
| 3:25:15| It wasn't specified how many stories it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| It was just that it was a future use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12318)|
| 3:25:21| The plan was not included in the use on review at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12321)|
| 3:25:25| So the one story was just something that the residents had requested at the time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12325)|
| 3:25:30| No, I think she's just stating that independent living facilities are typically one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12330)|
| 3:25:35| We didn't have a plan in place in that original use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12335)|
| 3:25:38| We had a plan for the apartment complex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12338)|
| 3:25:40| and it was just sort of dashed in saying future assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12340)|
| 3:25:44| We didn't have any site plans or anything like that for that specific facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12344)|
| 3:25:48| It was understood at that time that the independent living facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12348)|
| 3:25:53| would have to come back before this board for use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12353)|
| 3:25:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12356)|
| 3:25:57| It would have been three stories based on the density and based on the size of the track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12357)|
| 3:26:02| Three stories is very common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12362)|
| 3:26:04| I've worked on one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12364)|
| 3:26:05| Anybody familiar with Falling Waters Road there along Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12365)|
| 3:26:09| So it's not uncommon for three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12369)|
| 3:26:12| Even for an independent living facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12372)|
| 3:26:14| The one I'm referring to is an independent living facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12374)|
| 3:26:17| And it was going to be three stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12377)|
| 3:26:18| It is three stories, and this one was going to be as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12378)|
| 3:26:21| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12381)|
| 3:26:22| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12382)|
| 3:26:23| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12383)|
| 3:26:27| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12387)|
| 3:26:28| I'll hold my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12388)|
| 3:26:30| I was interested in the additional response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12390)|
| 3:26:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12392)|
| 3:26:33| Right now we're commission speaking, and we've passed the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12393)|
| 3:26:38| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| I'm concerned about the difference in the stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12399)|
| 3:26:45| It seems that the neighbors have expressed that they were on board with a one story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12405)|
| 3:26:51| and that now it's kind of a bait and switch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12411)|
| 3:26:54| It sounds like what they're saying is that now there's a three story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12414)|
| 3:26:57| which is a radical difference from their perspective where their properties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12417)|
| 3:27:00| So I'm concerned about that difference and interested in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12420)|
| 3:27:04| What we were shown at the original meeting in, was it 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12424)|
| 3:27:09| when they brought in all the pictures and all their boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12429)|
| 3:27:12| is that the apartment complex was going to be three stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12432)|
| 3:27:16| The independent living was shown to be one story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12436)|
| 3:27:22| So that's what they showed us, or that's what we were under the impression it was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12442)|
| 3:27:26| It was not going to be the same size and same height as the apartment complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12446)|
| 3:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12453)|
| 3:27:34| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12454)|
| 3:27:38| I don't know how my light got on, but since it is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12458)|
| 3:27:43| You're going to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| I don't remember punching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12465)|
| 3:27:48| I have an older sister that lives in Winchester, Virginia, in a large independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12468)|
| 3:27:56| well, not independent, in assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12476)|
| 3:27:59| And they have independent cottages, I guess you'd call them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12479)|
| 3:28:05| And she lives on the third floor of a large building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12485)|
| 3:28:12| It's all very nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12492)|
| 3:28:13| I don't really see the difference between one story and three stories as far as the occupants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12493)|
| 3:28:24| and what is available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12504)|
| 3:28:28| To me, it doesn't make any difference whether it's one story or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12508)|
| 3:28:34| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12514)|
| 3:28:37| I have a question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12517)|
| 3:28:38| I may be mislooking at the site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12518)|
| 3:28:40| but I see existing trees located in the inner water quality buffer to remain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12520)|
| 3:28:45| But you mentioned additional new landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12525)|
| 3:28:48| Is there a new landscaping buffer also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12528)|
| 3:28:55| Yes, the landscape buffer behind the building, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12535)|
| 3:28:58| I think you have the existing that then gets mixed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12538)|
| 3:29:02| or the new that gets mixed in with the existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12542)|
| 3:29:04| But they're indicated the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12544)|
| 3:29:06| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12546)|
| 3:29:07| They're just illustrated the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12549)|
| 3:29:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12550)|
| 3:29:12| Chair recognizes Commissioner Newton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12552)|
| 3:29:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12554)|
| 3:29:16| I do appreciate the residents' thoughts about being told about the assisted living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12556)|
| 3:29:25| I think staff was pretty clear that it was shown as a future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12565)|
| 3:29:30| That was a thought and an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12570)|
| 3:29:31| People do that all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| And that's the beauty of this particular zone that we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12573)|
| 3:29:36| It's a planned commercial zone, which requires developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12576)|
| 3:29:41| or drug treatment facilities or whatever to come through this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12581)|
| 3:29:47| and show what they're doing and provide plans for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| and let our professional staff look at them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| and tell us if we're doing the right things or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12591)|
| 3:29:55| And so we are in a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| They've submitted them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| There's a good stream buffer between the development and these apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12599)|
| 3:30:04| and they are doing supplemental landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12604)|
| 3:30:07| So I'm going to go ahead and make a motion to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12607)|
| 3:30:10| for the two additional apartment buildings subject to the conditions shown by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12614)|
| 3:30:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12616)|
| 3:30:18| Commissioner Smith, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12618)|
| 3:30:20| We have a motion and a second to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12620)|
| 3:30:24| for the two additional buildings adding 78 new dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12624)|
| 3:30:29| per staff's recommendation with the eight conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12629)|
| 3:30:33| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12635)|
| 3:30:36| Against? Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12636)|
| 3:30:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12638)|
| 3:30:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| Next is a use only view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12643)|
| 3:30:47| Item number 29, the applicant is Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12647)|
| 3:30:51| On behalf of Schubert and Schad Trustees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12651)|
| 3:30:55| location east side of Dry Gap Pike, north side of Fountain City Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12655)|
| 3:31:00| Property size is 2.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12660)|
| 3:31:03| Zoning is PR planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12663)|
| 3:31:06| Opposed, use retail establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12666)|
| 3:31:09| Staff's recommendation, approve the request for a retail store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12669)|
| 3:31:13| approximately 10,640 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12673)|
| 3:31:17| as shown on the development plan subject to the seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12677)|
| 3:31:23| Mr. Mullins, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| Still here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12685)|
| 3:31:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12686)|
| 3:31:27| Would you like to go first or would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12687)|
| 3:31:30| I'd like to hear the opposition first, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12690)|
| 3:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12692)|
| 3:31:33| So opposition, it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12693)|
| 3:31:39| we do have some individuals who are opposing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12699)|
| 3:31:42| so plan your time accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12702)|
| 3:31:44| Your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12704)|
| 3:31:45| You have up to five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12707)|
| 3:31:48| Jeffrey Cook, 6754 Timber Run Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12708)|
| 3:31:53| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12713)|
| 3:31:54| In the absence of the HOA President, Kevin Rodewald,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12714)|
| 3:31:57| I'm serving in the capacity of President Ex Officiato for the Sturkey Hills Phase III| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12717)|
| 3:32:02| Homeowners Association Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| I come before you with several points, and, again, I'll try to be succinct if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12726)|
| 3:32:12| Sometimes I try to ramble, and this shouldn't be one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12732)|
| 3:32:15| One, this retail facility is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12735)|
| 3:32:18| There are two Dollar Generals within two to three miles currently of our subdivision on Emory and Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12738)|
| 3:32:27| Therefore, you would lead to oversaturation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12747)|
| 3:32:30| We have a good economy currently, but when the economy goes down, as it always does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12750)|
| 3:32:34| then this facility has a possibility of no longer existing, and then it would go into disuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12754)|
| 3:32:41| It becomes an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12761)|
| 3:32:43| Second of all, aesthetics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12763)|
| 3:32:44| Currently, the property is a wooded lot near Tommy Shumpert Park, a sports facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12764)|
| 3:32:51| It looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12771)|
| 3:32:52| Everybody enjoys it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12772)|
| 3:32:53| Parking lots are not desirous over a wooded lot, and we do not want a retail facility next to our subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12773)|
| 3:33:01| Dollar Generals are not attractive stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12781)|
| 3:33:04| Although you have seen them, they are not something that you go, wow, that is fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12784)|
| 3:33:08| Looks something close to what I want to live to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12788)|
| 3:33:11| There have been concessions, as my understanding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12791)|
| 3:33:13| some concessions of adding some shrubbery and different aesthetic designs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12793)|
| 3:33:17| but, again, nothing says that will be maintained after this property is turned over or sold or after this is built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12797)|
| 3:33:24| Rhetorically, I ask all of you, would you want a Dollar General in your backyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12804)|
| 3:33:30| And that's literally what it's going to be for us and several other neighborhoods adjacent to the property we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12810)|
| 3:33:37| Next, lower property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12817)|
| 3:33:39| Residents of Sturkey Hills and several other neighborhoods adjacent to it chose this because it's away from everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12819)|
| 3:33:46| They like the nature, the serenity, the noise, no light pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12826)|
| 3:33:51| so there's nothing value-added to up our property values or make it any more attractive to attract residents to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12831)|
| 3:34:01| And the most important point of this is safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12841)|
| 3:34:04| Currently, there are four roads that go to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12844)|
| 3:34:07| However, they're two-lane roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12847)|
| 3:34:09| They're all insufficient as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12849)|
| 3:34:12| Some of the local people, there's a lot of hairpin turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12852)|
| 3:34:15| It's a 35-mile-per-hour roadway in almost every direction, but it's not good roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12855)|
| 3:34:21| They can barely support the traffic that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| If you add semi-trucks and the increased traffic going to the retail establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12864)|
| 3:34:30| now you're making a dangerous situation that no one has proposed any remedy to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12870)|
| 3:34:34| and you're endangering people in the subdivision because currently there are always people cutting through, going through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12874)|
| 3:34:42| As a former president, I've complained to Knox County Sheriff's Office to bring more people in to patrol the streets, but that doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12882)|
| 3:34:50| So adding more traffic to the outlying roads and in the subdivision is not a great solution whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12890)|
| 3:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12898)|
| 3:35:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12900)|
| 3:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12903)|
| 3:35:04| Currently, we have an online petition that's only been started last Thursday, which I'll make a follow-on point, that has 212 signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12904)|
| 3:35:13| We as a community were insufficiently notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12913)|
| 3:35:16| I do not know what the proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12916)|
| 3:35:19| From what I've heard, it's a sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| No one in our subdivision knew anything about this until Thursday of last week when we started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12921)|
| 3:35:26| So therefore, what I'm requesting of you is a postponement of a decision by the Planning Commission up until the time that questions that we have sent to Commissioner Mike Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12926)|
| 3:35:40| these be answered, and all these other questions so we can have at least a satisfactory answer back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12940)|
| 3:35:46| I yield the remainder of my time because we have at least four other residents who would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12946)|
| 3:35:52| Jennifer Weaver, 1612 Maremont Road, Sturkey Village, and my house is, you can actually see it on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12952)|
| 3:36:00| It's right behind there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12960)|
| 3:36:01| What I want to specifically address, because he did a good job addressing other things, is the signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12961)|
| 3:36:08| Number two, they put on there, the staff put on there, with the following exceptions of no wall sign may be internally illuminated, or the wall sign may be internally left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12968)|
| 3:36:21| Illuminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| According to your codes, no illuminated sign is permitted within 300 feet of a planned residential area, and also one non-illuminated wall sign shall be promoted for each tenant of a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=12983)|
| 3:36:41| And these are your codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13001)|
| 3:36:42| And if you look at that map, this is 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13002)|
| 3:36:47| That's my swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| So your lights are going to be hitting in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13009)|
| 3:36:52| So I want to please, no lights on this building if you're going to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13012)|
| 3:36:58| And if you're going to build it, speaking of the aesthetics, we want what Farragut has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13018)|
| 3:37:04| It's a beautiful building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13024)|
| 3:37:06| If we have to have this, if you're going to make us have a Dollar General, give us what Farragut has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13026)|
| 3:37:11| There is no illuminated site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| It's got the little lights that shine right down, which he was talking about, someone was talking about, with the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13033)|
| 3:37:19| It would illuminate off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| This is a nice facility, not the box that they currently have for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13041)|
| 3:37:26| And I'm sorry, I'll go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13046)|
| 3:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13048)|
| 3:37:32| Can you hand out the exhibits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13052)|
| 3:37:36| Can we give the opposition another two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13056)|
| 3:37:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13059)|

| 3:37:46| I'm in the neighborhood of Sturgy Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13066)|
| 3:37:48| I moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13068)|
| 3:37:49| I bought my first home this past six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13069)|
| 3:37:53| I had a whole bunch of stuff to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13073)|
| 3:37:54| They pretty much said it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13074)|
| 3:37:56| But I just want to, like, step back and look at what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13076)|
| 3:38:00| We have Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13080)|
| 3:38:02| We have it full of commercial everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13082)|
| 3:38:05| You can go get your nails done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13085)|
| 3:38:06| You can go get burgers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13086)|
| 3:38:07| You can go to Dollar General Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| You can go grocery shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| You have Merchant's Road, all kinds of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13091)|
| 3:38:14| You can go do anything you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13094)|
| 3:38:16| We're in the middle, right up there, in between those beautiful ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13096)|
| 3:38:20| Have you driven down Rifle Range and seen the canopy of trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13100)|
| 3:38:25| It's pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13105)|
| 3:38:26| You drive down Dry Gap, it's pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13106)|
| 3:38:28| We don't need to put a Dollar General there in front of Dollar General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13108)|
| 3:38:33| They have cardboard boxes they put out with pool noodles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13113)|
| 3:38:36| and all kinds of deep discount retailed items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13116)|
| 3:38:39| We can't even have those in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| We have restrictions against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| This is going to make our neighborhood have a certain appeal or non-appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13123)|
| 3:38:50| Nobody here, is there anybody in this room that wants a Dollar General in their neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13130)|
| 3:38:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13135)|
| 3:39:02| Ken Pankowicz, I live at Durham Park Lane 1718,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13142)|
| 3:39:05| which is in walking distance also of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13145)|
| 3:39:08| I'm concerned about the truck traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13148)|
| 3:39:10| While the planning study did show semi-truck accessibility to the store itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13150)|
| 3:39:15| Dry Gap Road is a very narrow, winding road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13155)|
| 3:39:18| and it is not suitable for semi-trucks of any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13158)|
| 3:39:22| In addition, there's 4,500 yards of cubic dirt designed to be imported to that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13162)|
| 3:39:29| It's only going to deteriorate the roads and conditions around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13169)|
| 3:39:32| for areas that are not intended for this type of activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| I'm a concrete contractor commercially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13176)|
| 3:39:38| I understand these type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13178)|
| 3:39:40| It takes years to get roads repaved around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13180)|
| 3:39:42| and we're only going to be deteriorating with the type of activity this is going to bring us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13182)|
| 3:39:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13187)|
| 3:39:54| My name is Keith Trumbo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13194)|
| 3:39:56| and I'm the pastor of the North Knoxville Seventh-Day Adventist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13196)|
| 3:39:59| located at 6530 Fountain City Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13199)|
| 3:40:04| While our property is immediately adjacent to the proposed Dollar General retail store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13204)|
| 3:40:09| we have a common property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| Our church was established in 1998 on this location 23 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13211)|
| 3:40:16| In November of 2019, we opened a new sanctuary with classroom addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13216)|
| 3:40:20| at a cost of $1.7 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13220)|
| 3:40:24| We enjoy the Sturkey Hills area with over 500 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13224)|
| 3:40:27| and a number of established other churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13227)|
| 3:40:30| The Board of Elders for our church met last evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13230)|
| 3:40:33| and discussed the proposal zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13233)|
| 3:40:36| and unanimously decided to oppose the proposal for two major reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13236)|
| 3:40:40| First, the building of the Dollar General retail store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13240)|
| 3:40:43| in the lot right next to us would dramatically change the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13243)|
| 3:40:49| Dollar General stores open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13249)|
| 3:40:52| seven days a week, 15 hours a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13252)|
| 3:40:55| Anyone who would like to patronize Dollar General, as pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13255)|
| 3:40:58| could go two miles to Emory Road or two miles to the opposite direction in Merchant's Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13258)|
| 3:41:04| Secondly, it was very clear from the comments that have been posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| on the knoxplanning.org website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13267)|
| 3:41:10| and the petition that has been submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13270)|
| 3:41:12| by the overwhelming majority of the residents of Sturkey Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13272)|
| 3:41:15| are opposed to this zoning change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13275)|
| 3:41:18| and we want to stand with our community in opposing this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13278)|
| 3:41:22| Hundreds of families have purchased or built homes in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13282)|
| 3:41:25| to get away from the commercial world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13285)|
| 3:41:28| We want to stand with our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13288)|
| 3:41:30| They have stated plainly that they neither want nor need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13290)|
| 3:41:33| a Dollar General store in their residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13293)|
| 3:41:36| Just one second. Commission, do you all want to allow additional time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13296)|
| 3:41:39| I know, that's what I'm saying. Do you want to allow additional time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13299)|
| 3:41:43| I need 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13303)|
| 3:41:45| I have about 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13305)|
| 3:41:47| We'll give you two more minutes, okay? Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13307)|
| 3:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13309)|
| 3:41:51| We realize that the Planning Commission staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13311)|
| 3:41:53| has stated that the applicant has met the technical requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13313)|
| 3:41:56| of the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13316)|
| 3:41:58| but that doesn't mean that you must approve this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13318)|
| 3:42:01| There are substantial reasons in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13321)|
| 3:42:03| that you should oppose this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13323)|
| 3:42:06| It means that you can follow the technicalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13326)|
| 3:42:08| and approve the zoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13328)|
| 3:42:10| or you can listen to the desires of the hundreds of working families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13330)|
| 3:42:13| in this community who have purchased homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| and raised concerns about this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| I hope that you will not approve this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13342)|
| 3:42:25| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13345)|

| 3:42:32| Very quickly, our community learned about this very shortly last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13352)|
| 3:42:37| Within that time, our community had a Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13357)|
| 3:42:41| We have a Facebook page for Sturkey Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13361)|
| 3:42:43| and we have 177 votes against Dollar General and 12 for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13363)|
| 3:42:50| My question is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13370)|
| 3:42:52| I've been in the grocery retail business for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13372)|
| 3:42:54| I understand location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13374)|
| 3:42:55| I understand volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13375)|
| 3:42:56| I understand the need for grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13376)|
| 3:42:59| We do not need a Dollar General outside of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13379)|
| 3:43:04| It's plain and simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13384)|
| 3:43:05| We just don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13385)|
| 3:43:07| It will bring nothing to the neighborhood other than traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13387)|
| 3:43:11| The taxpayers at Sturkey Hills and Sturkey Village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13391)|
| 3:43:15| pay well enough for their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13395)|
| 3:43:16| It's a very nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13396)|
| 3:43:17| You can check out the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13397)|
| 3:43:18| And if you looked at a Google Earth picture of where it's supposed to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13398)|
| 3:43:22| it doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13402)|
| 3:43:24| These are very nice homes, very well kept up like they used to be before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13404)|
| 3:43:28| We have standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13408)|
| 3:43:29| We have HOA criteria that we have to meet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13409)|
| 3:43:33| and everyone does an exceptional job of meeting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13413)|
| 3:43:36| A Dollar General or any retail, I'm not picking on Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13416)|
| 3:43:39| any retailer in that corner just doesn't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13419)|
| 3:43:44| There's not a necessity for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13424)|
| 3:43:47| There are six major million-dollar-a-month grocery stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13427)|
| 3:43:51| within a three- or four-mile radius, Kroger's and Food City's and Ingalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13431)|
| 3:43:57| I mean, we are covered with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13437)|
| 3:43:59| It is just not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13439)|
| 3:44:02| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13444)|
| 3:44:05| Mr. Mullins, you have additional time if you'd like to utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13445)|
| 3:44:13| Thank you, Chairman Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13453)|
| 3:44:14| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13454)|
| 3:44:17| Appreciate the time to speak to you about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| We have been working with both the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13462)|
| 3:44:26| and the county engineering for quite some time in anticipating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13466)|
| 3:44:33| and working through these issues that the neighborhood has raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13473)|
| 3:44:37| And we understand what their position is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13477)|
| 3:44:41| We have heard these types of issues before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13481)|
| 3:44:44| and we've taken that and tried to come up with a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13484)|
| 3:44:48| that would really improve upon things that we have done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13488)|
| 3:44:55| which is why we have been working with staff and the county engineering on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13495)|
| 3:45:00| I understand there's a concern about traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13500)|
| 3:45:05| and we have worked with the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| They don't have a concern with the traffic being able to access this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13509)|
| 3:45:13| And I think Mr. Elliott or Jim is still back there, I can't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13513)|
| 3:45:18| could comment on that at some point if you could ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13518)|
| 3:45:21| I mean, we did work with him on access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| and this area was actually intended to be a commercial node within the residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13523)|
| 3:45:31| in the country as it was placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| This property was zoned PR back in 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13533)|
| 3:45:38| and it's part of a development of over 1,100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13538)|
| 3:45:42| And this piece of property is kind of on an island to itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13542)|
| 3:45:47| It's bounded by Fountain City and Dry Gap Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13547)|
| 3:45:51| and there is an access easement that actually runs along behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13551)|
| 3:45:55| the long portion of that triangle property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13555)|
| 3:45:59| It's wooded, and if you look at the orientation of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13559)|
| 3:46:03| we're going to be facing away from the existing residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13563)|
| 3:46:07| So there's going to be a large degree of landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13567)|
| 3:46:10| existing vegetation between us and the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13570)|
| 3:46:12| and the existing residences that we actually bound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13572)|
| 3:46:15| And then we're separated by the road and the fences to Sturkey Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13575)|
| 3:46:21| When this property was initially rezoned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| there was a bit of commercial CB zoning to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13583)|
| 3:46:27| It's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| The road, I believe that's where Dry Gap Pike actually ran,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13589)|
| 3:46:33| and that road was then realigned to its current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13593)|
| 3:46:36| But leaving that CB property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13596)|
| 3:46:39| And what this triangle was intended to be, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13599)|
| 3:46:42| through the sector plan designated as a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13602)|
| 3:46:46| was really as a replacement for that because it is on the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13606)|
| 3:46:51| The road in both locations is controlled by a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13611)|
| 3:46:55| It widens to three lanes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13615)|
| 3:46:58| So it is the most appropriate place for any commercial node within this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13618)|
| 3:47:04| Dollar General is not a high-volume traffic-generating business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13624)|
| 3:47:09| It is intended to serve the traffic in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13629)|
| 3:47:15| One of the things, and this didn't come up in the comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13635)|
| 3:47:17| but it's all over the written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13637)|
| 3:47:19| And when I spoke to Mr. Rowald, the HOA president, yesterday about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13639)|
| 3:47:24| they had concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13644)|
| 3:47:25| They want the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| But we've worked with the county to try to improve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13647)|
| 3:47:30| and it was a requirement to integrate this property more with the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13650)|
| 3:47:35| residential neighborhood and improve pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13655)|
| 3:47:38| There is a subdivision slated to the south on Fountain City Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13658)|
| 3:47:42| Scott Davis, I believe, is developing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13662)|
| 3:47:45| And one of the requirements for that subdivision is to connect the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13665)|
| 3:47:49| greenway that runs to Schoenberg Park up Fountain City Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13669)|
| 3:47:54| The plans for this is to connect to that sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13674)|
| 3:47:58| and then run it along the sidewalk plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13678)|
| 3:48:01| On the other side of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13681)|
| 3:48:04| where it can serve the existing residential neighborhoods with crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13684)|
| 3:48:07| then, that go to this commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13687)|
| 3:48:10| and then a sidewalk to access there to improve pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13690)|
| 3:48:14| and then run the sidewalk further down Dante Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13694)|
| 3:48:18| to one of the other entrances to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13698)|
| 3:48:22| And that was to make this property safer for people to access it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13702)|
| 3:48:27| We have talked about a lot of different concessions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13707)|
| 3:48:31| and there's been some more conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| In staff's recommendations, condition number seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13713)|
| 3:48:36| they talk about working with them and modifying the front facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13716)|
| 3:48:42| to include additional cladding materials and building articulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13722)|
| 3:48:45| And we have talked, I've talked to Mr. Reynolds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13725)|
| 3:48:49| about expanding that condition to include working with not only staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13729)|
| 3:48:57| but Knox County and with the neighborhood on these other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13737)|
| 3:49:02| these aesthetic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13742)|
| 3:49:03| I know fenestration came up during the agenda review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13743)|
| 3:49:07| and the picture of the Farragut Dollar General was held up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13747)|
| 3:49:12| It does have fenestration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13752)|
| 3:49:14| Those are blackout windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13754)|
| 3:49:15| They're not functional windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| The design for Dollar General is to use that front wall for its stock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13757)|
| 3:49:23| and so there's shelving that goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13763)|
| 3:49:24| And so there's two different fenestration designs that Dollar General can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13764)|
| 3:49:28| One is the blackout fenestration like you see on the Farragut location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13768)|
| 3:49:34| The other is to put actual functional windows about 10 to 12 feet above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13774)|
| 3:49:40| to let in natural light into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13780)|
| 3:49:42| We're fine with either one as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13782)|
| 3:49:44| We'll continue to work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13784)|
| 3:49:46| Regarding the lighting, we have worked with our design group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13786)|
| 3:49:51| We can do the similar to the Farragut location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13791)|
| 3:49:55| We can have just the block letters, the raceway letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13795)|
| 3:49:58| and those letters not be internally illuminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13798)|
| 3:50:02| but illuminated the same way as the Farragut location is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13802)|
| 3:50:05| with the gooseneck scones that didn't shine down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13805)|
| 3:50:09| And we're also willing to make considerations with regard to the facade itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13809)|
| 3:50:15| I know there was two photographs that Mr. Reynolds just shared with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13815)|
| 3:50:22| and shared with me right before regarding some different design elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13822)|
| 3:50:26| And I think this one was, what, Bluefield, Virginia, maybe, the first one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13826)|
| 3:50:31| with the step-downs, with the awnings over the blackout windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13831)|
| 3:50:36| And that is something that we can work with as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13836)|
| 3:50:39| And if there's a concern about the sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| and maybe the neighborhood doesn't want the sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13841)|
| 3:50:44| that's a condition that was asked by Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13844)|
| 3:50:48| So we're willing to work with the neighborhood and Knox County on whatever they require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13848)|
| 3:50:58| There's a Dollar General right next to Foxton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13858)|
| 3:51:02| It's right near my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13862)|
| 3:51:03| I drive by it regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| There's been Dollar Generals developed all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13865)|
| 3:51:08| And the reason why there are so many is because, again, they're not destination locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13868)|
| 3:51:14| They're designed to be convenient for a neighborhood to serve the existing traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13874)|
| 3:51:19| With the increase of pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13879)|
| 3:51:22| and having General Mart right next to your residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13882)|
| 3:51:28| would actually cut down trips going further out to these commercial nodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13888)|
| 3:51:32| And that is the market that Dollar General attempts to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13892)|
| 3:51:36| I cited some citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13896)|
| 3:51:41| Dollar General is within five miles of 75% of the population of the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13901)|
| 3:51:46| It is a transcendent business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13906)|
| 3:51:49| It goes in rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13909)|
| 3:51:50| It succeeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13910)|
| 3:51:51| It goes in urban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13911)|
| 3:51:53| It succeeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13913)|
| 3:51:54| It goes in suburban areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13914)|
| 3:51:55| It succeeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13915)|
| 3:51:56| And we've seen that time and time and time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13916)|
| 3:51:59| So we're not concerned about there's a perception it's not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13919)|
| 3:52:05| We've done our market research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13925)|
| 3:52:07| We know it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13927)|
| 3:52:08| It wasn't needed 20 years ago when this planned residential property was first developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13928)|
| 3:52:13| but it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| And this property is owned by the Schubert and Schad Family Trusts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13935)|
| 3:52:18| and it's going to continue to be owned by the Schubert and Schad Family Trusts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13938)|
| 3:52:23| And so there is a local presence to this Dollar General that if the neighborhood has concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13943)|
| 3:52:29| they'll be able to have those concerns addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13949)|
| 3:52:33| So property values don't go down next to Dollar Generals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13953)|
| 3:52:37| You can look at the tax records and see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| You can look at the tax records in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13959)|
| 3:52:41| You can look at the tax records in Amherst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13961)|
| 3:52:44| There's not any substantial impact on property values from a development like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13964)|
| 3:52:49| There's also a perception, I think Commissioner Corberlake mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13969)|
| 3:52:53| in the agenda review meeting of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13973)|
| 3:52:58| And when you're five miles away from 75 percent of the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13978)|
| 3:53:02| you're going to have vastly different crime statistics depending on where you look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13982)|
| 3:53:06| If you look at the Dollar Generals in Knox County, in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13986)|
| 3:53:10| you're not going to see any crime statistics that are out of line with any other community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13990)|
| 3:53:15| So we're willing to agree to additional concessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=13995)|
| 3:53:20| and have them placed as conditions upon the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14000)|
| 3:53:24| but we would ask that you vote in favor of staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14004)|
| 3:53:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14007)|
| 3:53:28| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14008)|
| 3:53:30| The Chair will recognize Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14010)|
| 3:53:33| I'll give you a light on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| I just wanted to make everybody aware I did provide some images to our tech staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14017)|
| 3:53:44| if you want to see the Farragut Dollar General,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14024)|
| 3:53:49| and there's also another image of a more commercial type of a Dollar General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14029)|
| 3:53:54| that has a little more architectural design to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14034)|
| 3:53:58| And I've drafted some potential conditions to try to obtain similar designs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14038)|
| 3:54:06| whether it's a residential design like the Farragut one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14046)|
| 3:54:10| or a more commercial design like the brick one that you saw here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14050)|
| 3:54:14| And I'll be happy to pass those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14054)|
| 3:54:17| I only have a couple copies to hand out, but I can pass them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14057)|
| 3:54:20| Everybody can take a look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14060)|
| 3:54:24| The Chair will recognize Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14064)|
| 3:54:27| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14067)|
| 3:54:30| You know, I remember the days when every community had at least one general store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14070)|
| 3:54:35| and then I think somewhere in the last 30 or so years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14075)|
| 3:54:44| we started zoning in a way that separated commercial from residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14084)|
| 3:54:51| but when you think of the days gone by, they used to be somewhat integrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14091)|
| 3:54:56| And now you see around the country where they're reintegrating again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14096)|
| 3:55:02| Town center concepts are popular now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14102)|
| 3:55:05| Dollar General, I think, does a good job of existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14105)|
| 3:55:11| in the close proximity of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14111)|
| 3:55:14| They do provide local services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14114)|
| 3:55:16| The most traffic I ever see at any given one is probably four or five cars at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14116)|
| 3:55:22| I am concerned about the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14122)|
| 3:55:27| because I think every community neighborhood deserves to meet higher standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14127)|
| 3:55:33| That's not necessarily separated in a commercial corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14133)|
| 3:55:38| So what I would like to do is to make a motion that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14138)|
| 3:55:45| as you look at that last picture, Mr. Reynolds, if you could pull that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14145)|
| 3:55:52| I would like to specify in items on the Condition 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14152)|
| 3:55:59| approve the request for a retail store of approximately 10,640 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14159)|
| 3:56:04| as shown in subject to seven conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14164)|
| 3:56:07| And in that seventh condition, I would like to add more specificity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14167)|
| 3:56:12| And so there would be, I'm going to call them A, Bs, and Cs of Item 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14172)|
| 3:56:17| On all street-facing facades, provide projecting vertical wall articulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14177)|
| 3:56:22| of no less than 12 inches, such as pilasters and building entrances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14182)|
| 3:56:27| at no more than 30-foot intervals, much like you see on the previous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14187)|
| 3:56:33| not that one, but the previous photo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14193)|
| 3:56:37| Item B, no less than 50% of the width between the vertical articulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14197)|
| 3:56:47| shall include doors or windows at the pedestrian level of the facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14207)|
| 3:56:51| with the primary entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14211)|
| 3:56:53| The height of windows shall be no less than two-thirds of the width of the window system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14213)|
| 3:56:58| Architectural features such as awnings and canopies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14218)|
| 3:57:01| shall be provided over the windows and doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14221)|
| 3:57:04| Item C, varying the roof profile by stepping down portions of the facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14224)|
| 3:57:09| in sequence with the vertical wall articulations on all street-facing facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14229)|
| 3:57:14| And I believe this gives it adequate detail that would protect the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14234)|
| 3:57:21| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14241)|
| 3:57:22| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14242)|
| 3:57:23| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14243)|
| 3:57:24| I'd like to second that, but I'd like to add some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14244)|
| 3:57:26| We have a motion to second, but we still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14246)|
| 3:57:29| Does the Chair recognize Commissioner Eddie Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14249)|
| 3:57:33| And not to differ with my fellow Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14253)|
| 3:57:38| I represented a portion of this area for a few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14258)|
| 3:57:43| That is not in character with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14263)|
| 3:57:49| Just a quarter of a mile, just about a quarter of a mile is the old Sturkey Mansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14269)|
| 3:57:56| If I went on down the road to Dry Gap and hit Hayne Sturkey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| I can be at the other Dollar General store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| I think the hipped roof residential character actually would fit better in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14281)|
| 3:58:07| considering the Sturkey Hills neighborhood, the old Sturkey Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14287)|
| 3:58:11| the new development that's built right behind Sturkey Mansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14291)|
| 3:58:14| which is a very nice neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14294)|
| 3:58:16| That would all fit what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14296)|
| 3:58:19| Plus, it also goes with that rifle range road that has that canopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14299)|
| 3:58:24| And if you've never driven it, I would encourage you to drive it in the fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14304)|
| 3:58:27| when the leaves are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14307)|
| 3:58:29| It will honestly remind you of an old movie when you see the horse-drawn carriages going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14309)|
| 3:58:34| That's what that area represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14314)|
| 3:58:36| So I wouldn't want to lose the character of what is out in that area that is protected by that ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14316)|
| 3:58:44| going over to Cedar Lane with just another commercial building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14324)|
| 3:58:50| I think this that's up there right now, the hipped roof, fits the character of that area better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14330)|
| 3:58:57| It looks more like the church, which would be right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14337)|
| 3:59:01| It's got that pitched roof line instead of just a flat roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14341)|
| 3:59:04| So if the commissioner would be willing to amend to that, I could support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14344)|
| 3:59:09| I just can't support the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14349)|
| 3:59:12| Before we move on, I see Commissioner Korbelick's got her light on and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14352)|
| 3:59:19| The problem we get into situations like this, we start changing plans and making comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14359)|
| 3:59:26| We don't have anything visually to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14366)|
| 3:59:29| And maybe the best thing to do is postpone this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14369)|
| 3:59:33| Let them come back with a new drawing that picks up, emulates what Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14373)|
| 3:59:40| and what Commissioner Smith had talked about in terms of roof structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14380)|
| 3:59:44| and something that we can actually put our arms around and have a better understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14384)|
| 3:59:49| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14389)|
| 3:59:51| I'll recognize Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14391)|
| 3:59:55| Yes, I had several questions, and the first one would be directed to Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14395)|
| 4:00:02| I was just trying to get a good, clear understanding of the application proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14402)|
| 4:00:09| And I took a look at the landscape plan and grading, not grading plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14409)|
| 4:00:15| I don't have one yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14415)|
| 4:00:17| And it indicated that basically the entire site would be cleared given that you're putting in lawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14417)|
| 4:00:24| and you're quite a bit of fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14424)|
| 4:00:27| But in your letter in response to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14427)|
| 4:00:30| you indicated that only about a third of the property would be cleared out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14430)|
| 4:00:38| That's correct, Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14438)|
| 4:00:40| If you look at the landscape plan, there is landscaping along the back of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14440)|
| 4:00:45| We're going to try to keep as much of the existing vegetation as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14445)|
| 4:00:48| That's always the goal because it is more expensive to replace vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14448)|
| 4:00:53| than it is to try to leave it alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14453)|
| 4:00:56| That said, sometimes vegetation does have to get disturbed as you're trying to build it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14456)|
| 4:01:00| and there is going to have to be some fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14460)|
| 4:01:02| If you look at the orientation of the building, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14462)|
| 4:01:05| it's going to be to the north and the west portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14465)|
| 4:01:12| which leaves that 60-foot front setback on that end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14472)|
| 4:01:17| and it's further away from the residence behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14477)|
| 4:01:21| So we're trying to put it in the most convenient location where it has the best access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14481)|
| 4:01:26| and where we can leave as much vegetation as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14486)|
| 4:01:29| But to the extent we have to replace it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14489)|
| 4:01:31| we will follow the requirements of the Knox County Ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14491)|
| 4:01:34| with regard to their landscaping requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14494)|
| 4:01:36| Okay, I'm just trying to understand which led.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14496)|
| 4:01:39| And so basically what you're telling me is that you will attempt to save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14499)|
| 4:01:44| as much existing vegetation along the perimeter as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14504)|
| 4:01:48| because the interior does show significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14508)|
| 4:01:51| And that's fine. It's not that big a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| I was also wondering, a big problem with some businesses that have the parking in the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14513)|
| 4:02:00| is the fact that the bushes don't grow tall enough to screen the front ends of the vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14520)|
| 4:02:09| And I was going to look at a condition for discussion requiring that the vegetation along the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14529)|
| 4:02:17| with the bushes and the yew be at least tall enough to screen the front end of the vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14537)|
| 4:02:23| which is about three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14543)|
| 4:02:26| I also...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14546)|
| 4:02:30| Well, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14550)|
| 4:02:32| Oh, staff, if I may, why is there an exception under Condition 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14552)|
| 4:02:38| saying that the wall sign should not exceed 50 square feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14558)|
| 4:02:43| And that's in reference to the CN sign standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14563)|
| 4:02:47| I just don't know enough to know what the indication is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14567)|
| 4:02:51| I'll address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| The current, I guess, so we're in the PR zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14573)|
| 4:03:00| but the PR zone allows SCs, shopping center uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14580)|
| 4:03:05| It's not clear in the ordinance on exactly which sections of the ordinance get used for things like signage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14585)|
| 4:03:17| The PR says that you use the SC uses and their parking standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14597)|
| 4:03:23| In the PR zone, if you look at the sign standards in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14603)|
| 4:03:27| it's really geared towards home occupation signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14607)|
| 4:03:31| and it's like a two-square-foot sign that's permissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14611)|
| 4:03:34| or signage that's geared towards a neighborhood or an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14614)|
| 4:03:42| where you have an entrance sign, or even a church that has an announcement sign out front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14622)|
| 4:03:47| but it doesn't allow for or doesn't make provisions for commercial uses that are permissible in the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14627)|
| 4:03:55| So the only other option is that it's the SC zone that signage standards you're supposed to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14635)|
| 4:04:02| and it would allow a lot of signage here that the SC zone would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14642)|
| 4:04:07| And so staff's recommendation is to use the CN zone sign standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14647)|
| 4:04:12| but my exceptions were just in that I felt that it was reasonable to consider those exceptions in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14652)|
| 4:04:22| What would the sign size be under CN?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14662)|
| 4:04:28| Forty square feet is the, yeah, 40 for a wall sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14668)|
| 4:04:33| Okay. That's all my comments for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14673)|
| 4:04:36| If I could quickly just address a couple things, and I agree with Mr. Reynolds' description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14676)|
| 4:04:45| One of the things as far as allowing for a little bit more of the wall size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14685)|
| 4:04:49| I understand in this versus the CN zone, the CN zone has a smaller building requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14689)|
| 4:04:54| You would have a building that's 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14694)|
| 4:04:57| This building is twice as large, but we're only getting a very small increase over the standards of that sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14697)|
| 4:05:02| and we're fine with that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14702)|
| 4:05:04| As far as the landscaping, we'll plant landscaping along the front of the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14704)|
| 4:05:07| but that parking lot is actually facing away from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14707)|
| 4:05:11| It's facing towards the cell phone tower and that undeveloped property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14711)|
| 4:05:14| So it's not going to be facing the existing residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14714)|
| 4:05:17| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| It's just that it's right on the corner and quite visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14719)|
| 4:05:22| Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14722)|
| 4:05:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| I wanted to ask, in Commissioner Hill's listing, did you include anything about the actual windows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14727)|
| 4:05:36| Because I noticed in the ‑‑ was it that they were blackout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14736)|
| 4:05:40| They can be blackout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14740)|
| 4:05:42| I'd like to change that so that they're not blackout, if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14742)|
| 4:05:46| We're encouraged in the next iteration of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14746)|
| 4:05:49| Yeah, I think the picture we saw were blackout windows, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14749)|
| 4:05:53| They were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| That's one of the concerns I have with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14755)|
| 4:05:58| So if it is, I really appreciate Commissioner Phillips encouraging us to get something visual that we can all actually respond to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14758)|
| 4:06:05| that tries to bring all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| I just wanted to say, for the record, I would really like to see actual glass and not blackout windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14767)|
| 4:06:12| And I would like to say, even if we do require real windows with clear glass put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14772)|
| 4:06:19| they have no requirement of ‑‑ unless there's some kind of standard where you have to see within.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14779)|
| 4:06:26| You can't have an obstruction in the building up to like eight feet into the space or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14786)|
| 4:06:33| To say, okay, those are always going to be visible through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14793)|
| 4:06:36| And they can always build a wall behind it or put some other kind of obstruction so you can't see through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14796)|
| 4:06:42| and then put shelving and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14802)|
| 4:06:47| I think the big thing is if the void in the wall becomes, you know, built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14807)|
| 4:06:56| even if it's a nontransparent window, the opening is already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14816)|
| 4:07:01| I know we've heard about the concern, well, what if the Dollar General goes out of business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14821)|
| 4:07:05| Well, if they go out of business and the next person comes in, they've already got an opening in the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14825)|
| 4:07:11| If they want to put in clear windows and open it up, they could more easily than if it's a brick wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14831)|
| 4:07:18| and then they would have to cut it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14838)|
| 4:07:21| Does the opposition have another time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| No, right now the commission is able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14843)|
| 4:07:26| Can you help clarify this for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14846)|
| 4:07:28| Because I'm thinking about the example of the self‑storage facility that had clear glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14848)|
| 4:07:37| And it's done, obviously, to give it a greater sense of things are happening here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14857)|
| 4:07:41| even though things aren't happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| And the Dollar General having blackout windows, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14863)|
| 4:07:48| gives the impression that it's not occupied, kind of dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14868)|
| 4:07:54| And so actual glass would make it feel a bit more occupied and part of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14874)|
| 4:08:00| I totally agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14880)|
| 4:08:02| I totally agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14882)|
| 4:08:05| Chair will recognize Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14885)|
| 4:08:08| I think, like Mike said, the advantage of windows, whether they're blackout or whether they're visible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14888)|
| 4:08:12| is that it has a future impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14892)|
| 4:08:13| Beth, could you speak up a little louder, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14893)|
| 4:08:15| I think one of the advantages of windows, whether they're blackout or clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14895)|
| 4:08:18| is that it does give a future use should the building need to change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14898)|
| 4:08:23| The other thing I wanted to mention, though, is the point that in this particular image,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14903)|
| 4:08:28| you see ice machines, and I can't tell what that other permanent structure is outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14908)|
| 4:08:33| And sometimes there's seasonal storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14913)|
| 4:08:35| I think at some point that might need to be addressed also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14915)|
| 4:08:38| And that's not visible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14918)|
| 4:08:39| That's not part of what's in the second image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14919)|
| 4:08:41| And it makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14921)|
| 4:08:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14924)|
| 4:08:46| I just wanted to comment based on Commissioner Adams' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14926)|
| 4:08:50| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14930)|
| 4:08:51| I typically like clear windows in commercial spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14931)|
| 4:08:55| In their case, it could be an unintended consequence that you see racks in the backs of refrigerators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14935)|
| 4:09:03| and I don't know that you're better off seeing that or having the blackout windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14943)|
| 4:09:09| So just something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14949)|
| 4:09:14| Commissioner Korbelick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14954)|
| 4:09:16| Yes, just real briefly, I was wondering if Commissioner Hill would add to his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14956)|
| 4:09:22| that we would like to postpone for 30 days so the applicant can return with a better rendition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14962)|
| 4:09:29| that meets the conditions now discussed in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14969)|
| 4:09:36| I'd sure like to see what it is they end up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14976)|
| 4:09:42| Commissioner Oden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14982)|
| 4:09:44| I think it could be challenging to not have a visual of what we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14984)|
| 4:09:52| and not to scramble the eggs of everybody in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14992)|
| 4:09:56| but we do have a very clear visual of the Farragut store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=14996)|
| 4:10:00| That is something that the residents apparently applauded a few minutes ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15000)|
| 4:10:03| not that they like it, not that they want it approved, but it's something they did applaud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15003)|
| 4:10:08| The town of Farragut approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15008)|
| 4:10:10| It's built. It's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15010)|
| 4:10:11| It's right in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15011)|
| 4:10:12| I'm assuming what we can say is if we want a Farragut store on that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15012)|
| 4:10:17| with these other conditions of approval that staff has put in about lighting and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15017)|
| 4:10:24| that might be an alternate offer that the applicant could more easily reflect to the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15024)|
| 4:10:33| than it would be to try to go through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15033)|
| 4:10:38| Nebulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15038)|
| 4:10:39| Yeah, nebulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15039)|
| 4:10:41| Without a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15041)|
| 4:10:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15044)|
| 4:10:46| You know, we have that second option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15046)|
| 4:10:49| and I thought I was giving ample cover for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15049)|
| 4:10:53| but I would be willing to revise my motion that would reflect more of the Farragut store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15053)|
| 4:11:01| so I would replace my motion with what would be determined as deemed a residential character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15061)|
| 4:11:09| and if you want me to give the specificity of that, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15069)|
| 4:11:13| There are three items that would reflect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15073)|
| 4:11:17| and it would basically describe the Farragut store, so if I may, I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15077)|
| 4:11:24| So on condition number seven, we're going to have A, B, and C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15084)|
| 4:11:29| A, provide a varied roof profile by using a combination of gable and hip roof forms and overhangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15089)|
| 4:11:36| B, provide no less than two of the following elements on street-facing facades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15096)|
| 4:11:44| texture change, material module change, or a wall articulation change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15104)|
| 4:11:50| of no less than 12 inches in depth or projection, such as a reveal, pilaster, or projecting rib.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15110)|
| 4:11:58| These elements shall repeat at intervals of no less than 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15118)|
| 4:12:04| C, building materials and visual elements used on the primary building frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15124)|
| 4:12:09| must continue on all building facades that are visible from a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15129)|
| 4:12:16| That is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15136)|
| 4:12:20| Can we, Commissioner Hill, can we add that the buffering along the parking lot has to be, can we add that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15140)|
| 4:12:34| Condition eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15154)|
| 4:12:39| Provide front yard buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15159)|
| 4:12:43| That it reaches a minimum height of three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15163)|
| 4:12:48| That it reaches a minimum height of three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15168)|
| 4:12:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15173)|
| 4:13:03| Mr. Mullins, do you fully understand the direction your client needs to go at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15183)|
| 4:13:09| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15189)|
| 4:13:10| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15190)|
| 4:13:11| It's all I need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15191)|
| 4:13:12| All right, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15192)|
| 4:13:15| Excuse me, we've got more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15195)|
| 4:13:17| Are we basically going to approve the Farragut store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15197)|
| 4:13:25| Emulating that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15205)|
| 4:13:27| Certainly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15207)|
| 4:13:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15208)|
| 4:13:29| The Farragut store is on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15209)|
| 4:13:31| This isn't a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15211)|
| 4:13:33| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15213)|
| 4:13:35| The Farragut store is on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15215)|
| 4:13:37| This is a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15217)|
| 4:13:39| We understand, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15219)|
| 4:13:40| But we wanted to let you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15220)|
| 4:13:42| Ms. Adams, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15222)|
| 4:13:43| Yes, I wanted to say one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15223)|
| 4:13:46| Mainly as a why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15226)|
| 4:13:51| Commissioner Uden said, we've got this example pretty darn close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15231)|
| 4:13:55| I'm paraphrasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15235)|
| 4:13:57| Let's go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15237)|
| 4:13:59| And my attitude is we might even come up with something that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15239)|
| 4:14:03| So that is why I would rather it come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15243)|
| 4:14:06| I understand that there is energy to go in the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15246)|
| 4:14:09| But I feel like we're looking at something that's pretty close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15249)|
| 4:14:13| We might make some other alternations and improvements instead of just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15253)|
| 4:14:16| hitting copy-paste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15256)|
| 4:14:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15259)|
| 4:14:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15260)|
| 4:14:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| Everybody understand the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15263)|
| 4:14:29| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15271)|
| 4:14:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15272)|
| 4:14:34| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15274)|
| 4:14:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15276)|
| 4:14:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15277)|
| 4:14:40| The last item is a removal of a planned district designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15280)|

| 4:14:51| The applicant is Benjamin Mullins on behalf of Rufus Smith and Dooley LP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15291)|
| 4:14:57| Location, south side of Dean Hill Drive, east side of Winchester Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15297)|
| 4:15:02| Tract is 5.21 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15302)|
| 4:15:05| Zoning is general residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15305)|

| 4:15:15| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15315)|

| 4:15:20| designation from this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15320)|
| 4:15:23| Mr. Mullins, I see you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15325)|
| 4:15:33| Mr. Mullins, would you like to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15333)|
| 4:15:35| or would you like opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15335)|
| 4:15:38| There is opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15338)|
| 4:15:39| Yes, I'd like to hear from the opposition, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15339)|
| 4:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15340)|
| 4:15:52| Robert Holtz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15352)|
| 4:15:54| I live at 509 Stone Pony Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15354)|
| 4:16:01| 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15361)|
| 4:16:04| Just wanted to make a couple comments about opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15364)|
| 4:16:12| Number one, the property was considered for a review four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15372)|
| 4:16:20| and it was denied and requested that we have or that it be limited to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15380)|
| 4:16:27| 5.99 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15387)|
| 4:16:33| We would hope that that is considered going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15393)|
| 4:16:41| Would like to see that whatever they do with this property be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15401)|
| 4:16:48| with the housing that is already on Dean Hill Road in the Winchester Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15408)|
| 4:16:56| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15416)|
| 4:16:58| I happen to live on Stone Pony Lane, which is a little ways down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15418)|
| 4:17:04| It's a planned urban development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15424)|
| 4:17:06| There are 28 units in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15426)|
| 4:17:09| Everything in the vicinity is fundamentally a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15429)|
| 4:17:16| My understanding is that the developer doesn't have a plan as to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15436)|
| 4:17:21| they want to do yet, that they're asking for the change so they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15441)|
| 4:17:26| have the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15446)|
| 4:17:28| And if the flexibility is such that you could have a condominium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15448)|
| 4:17:32| a single-family or duplex, that is not consistent with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15452)|
| 4:17:41| Finally, and since I've only been on the street for four years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15461)|
| 4:17:47| I find Dean Hill Road is very similar to some of the roads that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15467)|
| 4:17:54| around my previous home in Boone County, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15474)|
| 4:17:59| It's a paved goat path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15479)|
| 4:18:02| There is no shoulder in some areas to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15482)|
| 4:18:06| There is a section of Dean Hill at the moment where the white lines are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15486)|
| 4:18:12| deteriorated and is falling off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15492)|
| 4:18:15| There are numerous accidents that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15495)|
| 4:18:19| The speed limit is posted as 40 miles an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15499)|
| 4:18:24| Frankly, I rarely go above 30 to 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15504)|
| 4:18:29| It's just not conducive for the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15509)|
| 4:18:33| I hope that the county or the city would have a traffic impact study to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15513)|
| 4:18:40| see what's going on there because of the accidents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15520)|
| 4:18:45| the speeding that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15525)|
| 4:18:47| It's not just cars that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15527)|
| 4:18:50| There are 18-wheeler trucks because it's a cut-through for distributors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15530)|
| 4:18:57| So with that, I will yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15537)|
| 4:19:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15558)|
| 4:19:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15559)|
| 4:19:20| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15560)|
| 4:19:23| This is a request to remove an existing planned development overlay on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15563)|
| 4:19:29| As the gentleman just said, it was rezoned to a planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15569)|
| 4:19:34| which was a zoning that was allowed back in 2014 for, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15574)|
| 4:19:40| 5.99 dwelling units and an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15580)|
| 4:19:44| When cities rezoned all the properties, the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15584)|
| 4:19:51| this property was then rezoned to RN3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15591)|
| 4:19:55| and we would like to be able to develop this property under the RN3 rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15595)|
| 4:20:02| as the city at that time deemed was appropriate for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15602)|
| 4:20:07| so it could be developed consistently with that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15607)|
| 4:20:11| There's not, if you look at staff's recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15611)|
| 4:20:14| there's not a whole lot of difference in the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15614)|
| 4:20:19| at least with regard to the single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15619)|
| 4:20:22| There is consideration in RN3 for duplexes and for townhomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15622)|
| 4:20:28| The townhome, though, if we were to move forward with that type of concept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15628)|
| 4:20:32| that would have to come back before this body on a special-use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15632)|
| 4:20:38| Correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15638)|
| 4:20:39| I thought Stone Pony Lane, looking at the map there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15639)|
| 4:20:42| those look like they're attached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15642)|
| 4:20:44| They're not detached units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15644)|
| 4:20:46| Some are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15646)|
| 4:20:48| There are two or three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15648)|
| 4:20:51| It's either two or three units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15651)|
| 4:20:54| And the RN3 would allow something like that to be developed in that fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15654)|
| 4:21:00| should they choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15660)|
| 4:21:02| Of course, we don't have a plan yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15662)|
| 4:21:04| We don't know what our zone is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15664)|
| 4:21:06| But we do think, I mean, with the recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15666)|
| 4:21:14| a lot of the process for use on review was replaced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15674)|
| 4:21:18| with there being more stringent dimensional design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15678)|
| 4:21:23| That was the whole point of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15683)|
| 4:21:25| And there are more stringent design standards for RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15685)|
| 4:21:29| And if we decide to move forward with townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15689)|
| 4:21:32| this will be back before you guys at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15692)|
| 4:21:37| So we support staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15697)|
| 4:21:40| and we'd ask that you would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15700)|
| 4:21:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15702)|
| 4:21:44| Any questions, comments, commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15704)|
| 4:21:48| Commissioner Deason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15708)|
| 4:21:50| I received a packet this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15710)|
| 4:21:52| I'm not sure if other commissioners received it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15712)|
| 4:21:54| but I just wanted to pass it around in case you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15714)|
| 4:21:56| so that it gets included for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15716)|
| 4:21:58| There were some photographs and concerns about traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15718)|
| 4:22:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15721)|
| 4:22:03| Commissioner Midas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15723)|
| 4:22:05| Yeah, I was just going to comment that under recode,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15725)|
| 4:22:08| the RN3 would allow the development that's happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15728)|
| 4:22:11| at Stony Point Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15731)|
| 4:22:14| And he's right, like the restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15734)|
| 4:22:16| and the dimensional standards that are now in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15736)|
| 4:22:19| are going to be even more stringent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15739)|
| 4:22:20| than when yours was developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15740)|
| 4:22:23| I guess one question that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15743)|
| 4:22:26| and I think you denied something earlier today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15746)|
| 4:22:29| because you didn't have a specific use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15749)|
| 4:22:32| You were doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15752)|
| 4:22:34| You were rejecting a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15754)|
| 4:22:37| because you didn't have a specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15757)|
| 4:22:40| And we don't have a specific plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15760)|
| 4:22:43| for what this is going to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15763)|
| 4:22:45| So why make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15765)|
| 4:22:48| if you don't know what you're going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15768)|
| 4:22:52| And I understand flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15772)|
| 4:22:56| I just question that logic at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15776)|
| 4:23:01| And I guess I would ask for staff input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15781)|
| 4:23:05| but it's RN3 currently, isn't it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15785)|
| 4:23:07| with just the C designation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15787)|
| 4:23:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15789)|
| 4:23:11| So he's just removing the commercial aspect to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15791)|
| 4:23:15| and making it residential only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15795)|
| 4:23:17| Well, it's not commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15797)|
| 4:23:18| It's planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15798)|
| 4:23:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15800)|
| 4:23:22| I'll ask Ms. Porchet to kind of weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15802)|
| 4:23:26| because I spoke with her yesterday about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15806)|
| 4:23:30| how the C designation actually affects this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15810)|
| 4:23:34| So the C designation just indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15814)|
| 4:23:37| that this was formerly a planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15817)|
| 4:23:40| It's not named PD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15820)|
| 4:23:41| because we also have something called a planned development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15821)|
| 4:23:43| So this just kind of helps differentiate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15823)|
| 4:23:45| between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15825)|
| 4:23:46| The C is just a random letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15826)|
| 4:23:48| so it might be a little bit confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15828)|
| 4:23:50| But it's just to indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15830)|
| 4:23:53| that there was a former planned district here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15833)|
| 4:23:56| There were not plans that were ever approved for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15836)|
| 4:23:59| The plans that were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15839)|
| 4:24:00| were pending a rezoning that did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15840)|
| 4:24:02| So we do not have any plans for this district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15842)|
| 4:24:06| So the removal of the planned district designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15846)|
| 4:24:10| means that they can build another RN3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15850)|
| 4:24:13| without that C designation in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15853)|
| 4:24:20| I don't know if that helps clear it up for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15860)|
| 4:24:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15863)|
| 4:24:24| I just want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15864)|
| 4:24:25| So that former planned district designation, the C,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15865)|
| 4:24:29| would mean they'd have to go back to the old code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15869)|
| 4:24:32| and we'd have to utilize those regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15872)|
| 4:24:35| to be able to review their plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15875)|
| 4:24:37| whatever they submitted for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15877)|
| 4:24:40| So that would be that former rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15880)|
| 4:24:41| Like the conditions that were on that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15881)|
| 4:24:44| Well, it would just be the standards in the old code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15884)|
| 4:24:46| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15886)|
| 4:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15887)|
| 4:24:49| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15889)|
| 4:24:52| Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15892)|
| 4:24:54| and Dean Hill and where you live as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15894)|
| 4:24:57| and I feel like this is a reasonable request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15897)|
| 4:25:02| And I would make a motion that we approve this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| to remove the C designation from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15906)|
| 4:25:08| Actually, the new RN3 that's in place now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15908)|
| 4:25:11| will probably have more restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15911)|
| 4:25:13| than what it had previously when your neighborhood was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15913)|
| 4:25:18| So I think you'll be happy with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15918)|
| 4:25:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15921)|
| 4:25:22| I'd like to second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15922)|
| 4:25:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15924)|
| 4:25:25| Yeah, I just wanted to speak to the discrepancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15925)|
| 4:25:28| or the perceived discrepancy of the concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15928)|
| 4:25:32| about one denial versus this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15932)|
| 4:25:35| And in earlier cases, the zone that was being requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15935)|
| 4:25:40| was actually much more intensive than the one that existed already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15940)|
| 4:25:45| So that was why there was concern about changing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15945)|
| 4:25:48| without knowing what might happen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15948)|
| 4:25:50| because it could be very disruptive to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15950)|
| 4:25:55| whereas this is actually, to Commissioner Smith's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15955)|
| 4:25:59| having more restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15959)|
| 4:26:01| and keeping it a bit more in line with what is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15961)|
| 4:26:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15967)|
| 4:26:08| So we have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15968)|
| 4:26:11| seconded by Commissioner Korbelick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15971)|
| 4:26:13| to approve the request to remove the planned district C designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15973)|
| 4:26:17| per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15977)|
| 4:26:19| All in favor of the motion say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15981)|
| 4:26:22| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15982)|
| 4:26:23| Motion carries unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15983)|
| 4:26:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15984)|
| 4:26:27| We are finished the agenda for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15987)|
| 4:26:30| Motion to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15990)|
| 4:26:31| We have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15991)|
| 4:26:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15992)|
| 4:26:33| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15993)|
| 4:26:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15994)|
| 4:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210610?start=15995)|
