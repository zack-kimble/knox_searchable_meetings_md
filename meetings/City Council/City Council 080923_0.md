| 0:02:20| Seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=144)|
| 0:02:26| Councilmember Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=146)|
| 0:02:28| Yes, I would like to postpone 10B and 11Q for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=148)|
| 0:02:36| 10B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=156)|
| 0:02:38| This is the Kroger Fountain City Gibbs Drive appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=158)|
| 0:02:43| And I know from folks from Gibbs Drive here that have talked about this, and I've talked to Kroger's, and they've asked for this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| 10B and 11Q for how long, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Moved and probably seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| All in favor, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=176)|

| 0:03:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| On a related note, 9H's and Herald also involves a portion of that same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=183)|
| 0:03:10| I didn't know if it would make any sense if that should be bundled together with it since it is part of the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| It's actually not the same property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| This is the adjacent property, isn't it, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| Is this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Yeah, these are the remainder parcels north and south of the Kroger site that had been zoned shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=205)|
| 0:03:33| I have no problem postponing if you think it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| If it's different, I don't pretend to read maps for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| Any other postponements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=223)|

| 0:03:51| It's not anything to be moved, so I'll wait then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=234)|

| 0:03:59| Consent items are 11R through 11V.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=243)|

| 0:04:13| Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=253)|
| 0:04:15| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| I have an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| We have two items, 11J and 11O, which fundamentally deal with Luz Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| and I'd just like to move 11O to the same rough spot on the agenda as 11J so we can take them up at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=263)|
| 0:04:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| At the appropriate time, we'll get to 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Just make sure to remind the Chair that 11O will be moved up to immediately behind 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=277)|
| 0:04:44| I think that's fine, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| All those in favor, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Councilmember Roddy, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=289)|
| 0:04:51| She had her light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| I just was going to ask if it made any sense to consider 11O before we consider 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| You know, my sense is they sort of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| I guess 11J before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| I don't know which the order – what I hope happens is a discussion is sort of about both of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=304)|
| 0:05:09| because they are two solutions to the same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=309)|
| 0:05:12| So, you know, at some level, whichever is first I hope doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| We'll just say when we get to that juncture, we're going to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| All in favor of the – Mr. Martin, your light's on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=319)|
| 0:05:21| Would you like to have something to say, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I always recognize the Deputy Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| Motion to move 11O up to – with 11J, signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=329)|

| 0:05:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Those opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Any other items for withdrawal, postponement, or any other agenda notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=337)|
| 0:05:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Now we're to the Mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=346)|
| 0:05:48| Our Mayor, Mayor Haslam, had to be out of the city today, and therefore I'm chairing this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| He sends his regrets, obviously wishes he could be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| And we're also good to see Councilmember Woodhull here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| I know he's still under the weather, but we appreciate you coming in to be with us here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| Just one other item, and I guess it's really a personal item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| so please give me just a few seconds of personal privilege,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=370)|

| 0:06:32| I wanted to say to you personally thank you and thanks to Mr. Swanson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| and a lot of folk in the council office who showed me, as we say where I'm from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| much love through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=401)|

| 0:07:30| And you have been a wonderful leader for this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| I just was very torn on that issue because letting you spread your wings and fly away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| meant that we were going to lose you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I just want you to know that I think this council really will benefit from having you with us a bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=462)|

| 0:07:54| and my aunt and my mother and all these relatives and people who came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| I felt really special, really warm and fuzzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| And a big guy like me feeling warm and fuzzy, that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=481)|

| 0:11:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| Mr. Martin, we received a revision this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| and it indicates some additional funding for the cultural center at the Gateway Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| Could you give us some more details about that please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=706)|
| 0:11:48| Council Member Roddy, I'd be delighted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=708)|
| 0:11:51| First of all, the administration apologizes to Council for adding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=711)|
| 0:11:57| making a late addition to this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=717)|
| 0:12:01| But this matter surfaced just recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| The Gateway Building, which is where Beck has their artifacts and archives maintained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| is a city building and has been in discussion with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| What we're proposing here is to help Beck out for a few months while a transition is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| The plan is for Beck to move to the Burlington Library once the build-out is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| That could take three to four months to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| Once that build-out is complete, Beck would move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| But that, too, would be a temporary move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| until some additions and renovations are made to their headquarters on Dandridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=761)|
| 0:12:47| So the ultimate objective is to get the archives back to the Dandridge facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| It's going to take several steps to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| We felt it was appropriate for the city to assist Beck in that move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| Our support comes in helping them with the cost of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| the Gateway Building, for the next four to six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| So this is not supporting the actual costs of the physical move out to Burlington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| This is utility costs and other associated maintenance costs with the Gateway Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=800)|
| 0:13:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| Yeah, I believe, and Mr. Swanson, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| we need an amendment to change what's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=805)|
| 0:13:28| So I'm going to make an amendment that the revised version, with all language in that, be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=808)|
| 0:13:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=814)|

| 0:15:46| Before we hear a motion, we have several people signed up to speak and what has been our practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| in the past is prior to having a motion that we allow individuals to speak, I would assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| we want to move in that same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Also, we need to do a little quick housekeeping here, I want to note for the record and for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=961)|
| 0:16:07| council members for the appropriate action that we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 individuals I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| that are signed up for the ordinance and we have 1, 2, 3, 4 individuals signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=975)|
| 0:16:26| Our rules are that they are allowed three per side, so unless each side is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| whittle themselves down to three speakers each, we would need a motion from a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| of council in order to add those additional spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Yes, sir, Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| Mr. Vice Mayor, members of council, I'm here on behalf of Fort Sanders Regional Medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1001)|
| 0:16:47| Center, I'm one of those who signed up, I cannot talk tonight so we can whittle ours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| down to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| All right, so you'll whittle down to three and we'll scratch you off on that one, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| All right, why don't we go ahead, Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| So you're saying now there are three on each side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| No, there are three now in favor of and actually four, 1, 2, 3, 4 who have signed up against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| That is 9E right here, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| That's four and three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Three with Mr. Seymour stepping down, there's four and three if I'm counting correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| 1, 2, 3, that's four and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| I'd like to make a motion that we suspend the rules to allow additional speakers to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| All those in favor signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1057)|
| 0:17:38| That should work out okay because there's four and four on each side and if you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| decide that you want to knock one more off, Mr. Seymour will gladly accept that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| As I said, I'm not going to try to address the issues directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| Kent Altshuler, the administrator of Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center will lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1074)|
| 0:18:00| off for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| We will have Dr. Casey second and Dr. Rose both on the medical staff at Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| Regional who will continue our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1089)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| Mr. Altshuler, the time is 724.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| Give us your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1103)|

| 0:18:28| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| Again, I'm Keith Altshuler, president of Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| I want to call your attention to the slide above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| It's an actual picture that we found in our archives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Back then, Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center began serving the Knoxville business or medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1119)|
| 0:18:44| community roughly 87 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| The hospital, as you see, stood alone on the Fort Sanders hilltop in a beautiful Victorian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1126)|
| 0:18:51| structure and what I understood was the very complex and state-of-the-art hospital for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| its time back in that period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Later, a neighborhood developed around it and Fort Sanders became a very good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| Our employees have lived, shopped, dined, and traveled throughout the Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1143)|
| 0:19:08| district for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| They've helped deliver our children and treated all forms of illnesses and injuries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| throughout the many years that it's been in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| But as the healthcare needs of East Tennessee grew and medical advances were made, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| hospital grew and made these advances available to our patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| Fort Sanders has established a standard of care that is second to none in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| Because of this reputation, it's known as a regional referral center to many smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| medical facilities throughout East Tennessee, southern Kentucky, and Virginia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| Patients come to our Patricia Neal Rehab Center from throughout the United States and, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| fact, throughout the world for rehabilitation and restorative care in our state-of-the-art| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| rehab center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| Many East Tennesseans have been treated at the renowned Thompson Cancer Survival Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And with us tonight is Elmira Tiefteller, our advanced practice nurse, who provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1198)|
| 0:20:03| mammography outreach services for more than 3,000 underserved patients every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| And she brought with her Wilma Kaysen, who is a breast cancer center survivor from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1208)|
| 0:20:13| center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| In addition, the HOPE Center, unique only to our hospital in Knoxville, provides support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| and resources to AIDS patients and other patients dealing with oftentimes fatal diseases in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Dr. Jeanne Gillian of the center is here with us, as is Mary Ann Green, who is here representing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| one of the families previously served at the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| Our Platinum Awards winners are here representing seniors who continue to contribute to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| community and remind us that you don't have to be young to continue to contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| Only young at heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| With us tonight is Nancy Seiler, our most recent award winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| In total, we have served roughly 212,000 patients at our hospital last year, and we're on pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| to increase those amounts of patients in this year currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| Our mission has always been to improve the health of our community, and one of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| tangible expressions of that is our provision of services to all patients who come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| our doors, regardless of their ability to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| Last year alone, Fort Sanders Regional provided over $25 million in subsidized care to patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| in our community, with over $9 million of that in charity care alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1280)|
| 0:21:25| We've also subsidized multiple community organizations, including the Interfaith Health Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| Kelly Maynor is here representing that organization on our behalf today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| As well as the Senior Citizens Home Assistance Service and the wellness community, to name a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| And also contributed mightily to many multiple downtown initiatives, non-healthcare related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| throughout the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| We believe that we have been excellent corporate citizens, and we continue to want to be that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1306)|
| 0:21:51| throughout the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1311)|
| 0:21:54| Our physicians and staff, many of whom are with us tonight, have encouraged us for a long time now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| to proceed with the expansion and associated road closing on 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| They told us that the project will continue to make access to the hospital and to the emergency department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| easier and safer for their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Our current medical office buildings are aging, and we need more space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| It's critical that the new building be directly linked to our existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| core hospital medical center to facilitate efficient flow of patients from the physician's offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| from the proposed outpatient surgery center, and other diagnostic services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| projected for our new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| We need to have that continuity to get back to the high-end inpatient surgery and diagnostic services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| that we have in our core structure in order to continue to provide continuity of care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| for those patients and the physicians who need those backup of resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| This is the only location that we have for the needed building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| and the 19th Street connection is the only way we can make it functional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| We submit that Knoxville cannot afford to lose another downtown hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| The expansion will bring new physicians into the community and create more than 100 new jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| and we believe produce substantial tax revenues over the years to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| When coupled with the 2,000 employees already working at the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| and the hundreds of physicians and associated office staff surrounding them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1399)|
| 0:23:23| the economic impact of our medical center, we believe, is substantial to downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1403)|
| 0:23:28| You have one more minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| We've delayed this project to study the issues raised about traffic patterns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| north-south connectivity, owner-occupied housing, and other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| However, these delays have cost us real dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| and we are not immune to the financial crisis that's gripping our nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1422)|
| 0:23:46| While we remain committed to the project, the time for delay is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| The simpler slope for us is the loss of physicians due to our inability to construct this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1430)|
| 0:23:56| To us, this is about providing the best and highest quality service and care available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| to our community, to our citizens, and to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| To us, it's that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| This plan accomplishes what we need to move forward with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| and we're asking for your support tonight in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| A negative vote will ensure that the project cannot proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| There have been a lot of people that have helped us and been friends at the hospital for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| and stood behind us over the last many months as we've tried to address all these concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| At this time, I'd like to just have them to rise and acknowledge all the help that they've given us, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1465)|
| 0:24:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1477)|
| 0:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| Dr. Michael Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I've got to, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| At the end, did I hear you say that a negative vote means the project won't go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| which is different from what you said last Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| And part of the reason, a big part of that reason is all the financial crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| and the impact that that's had on our financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1497)|
| 0:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1500)|
| 0:25:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1502)|
| 0:25:03| Dr. Michael Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Time is 731.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Sir, give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I'm Dr. Mike Casey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| My address is Suite 600, Trustees Tower, at Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1509)|
| 0:25:14| As I've addressed you all before, I am the current Chief of Staff at Fort Sanders Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1514)|
| 0:25:21| I represent close to 600 physicians that are on staff at the medical center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1521)|
| 0:25:26| As the picture shows, the hospital's been around for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| It is a tertiary referral center servicing all 16 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| Patients come from Kentucky as well as from Virginia to this medical center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| and have for many years, way before I was ever there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| The point of this project is pivotal, not only to myself, but also the physicians here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| and the nearly 600 that I represent in making this hospital continue the top quality care place that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1548)|
| 0:25:56| It has to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| All physicians, all technology, all hospitals have to move in a positive direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| This project allows this to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| It allows it to be safer and easier for patients to transfer back from office spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| outpatient surgery center, and other outpatient facilities to the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1571)|
| 0:26:16| both critically injured patients and not critically injured patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Patients want an easy, safe, accessible way to get into the office spaces from the physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| as well as to get to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Patients will come to my office and then go directly to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| The closure of 19th Street and allowing to have this project makes it easier, more efficient, and safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1594)|
| 0:26:43| Because whether you like it or not, if 19th Street's not closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| they will not go down three levels to go under a tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| They will cross 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| That's what they do now, and they will continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| As I mentioned before, too, this project allows us to keep the top quality care physicians that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1615)|
| 0:27:02| and also recruit new physicians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| If we do not recruit new physicians, if we cannot keep the top quality physicians we have, you have no patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| No physicians, no patients, no hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| Look no further than across the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| Now, there's a multitude of reasons why that occurred, and I'm not going to get into those tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| but as Mr. Altshuler said, we can't afford to lose another downtown hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| Yes, Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| Yes, Doctor, how were you kept in the loop in regard to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| Were you kept informed of its progress and the necessity to close 19th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1658)|
| 0:27:46| Through many, many, many meetings, many meetings, during the day, at night, constant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1666)|
| 0:27:56| You personally or many other physicians?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| Myself as well as many other physicians, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Okay. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1685)|
| 0:28:08| Doctor Casey, you just said, I believe, that if 19th Street is not closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1688)|
| 0:28:16| patients will not go down three levels to cross into, to move into the main hospital building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| from this physician's office structure, that they will cross the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| Have you seen the plans, the preliminary plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1709)|
| 0:28:32| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Well, the plans that were presented to this council show two levels of crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| The original plans that were presented to some of us a week before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| only showed one level of interior crossing that would function for the public and the other would not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| But they changed that so that my understanding is that two levels would function to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| for both public and staff to move from the office building, the new building, into the core building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| And the lower, whether you take the lower of those two levels of crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| or the upper of those two levels of crossing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| you have to get in an elevator or get on a stair, enter a staircase, to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| So your statement that your patients will not go down three levels to cross over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| the majority of the crossings would, I would guess, would take place at that lower level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| I would guess it would depend on where they were going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| If they were going to diagnostics, they would go through the upper level crossings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| so that they wouldn't have to go back up in an elevator in the core building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| But those that were going to the main level would go through on the lower crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1781)|
| 0:29:45| So regardless of which crossing they're going through on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| they still got to go down either an elevator or a staircase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1789)|
| 0:29:53| And I would assume most of them would take the elevator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| That's pretty typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1795)|
| 0:29:57| So whether they, I have a little problem understanding your statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| because if they're going to get on an elevator and go down to cross over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1802)|
| 0:30:08| you're saying that they wouldn't do that, they would cross the street instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| And I don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Because they're going to have to get on an elevator to go down to cross, no matter what happens here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| The gist of the statement was that I know it's been discussed with before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1819)|
| 0:30:24| and possibly from you, I'm not sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1824)|
| 0:30:26| that there's concern about, we're going to close the way the current project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| and I'll have the architects back me up, I'm not an architect, I'm a physician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| that from the parking garage, there would be as direct access going straight into the ED department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| straight to the lobby area, going in at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| That's right from where a parking garage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Now, without closing 19th Street, you're going to have a parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| and people are still going to have to access from that parking to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| And my point was, whether it's three levels, one level, two level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| people are going to walk across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| They do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Okay, I'm sorry, I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| I thought you meant from the condition space, the office space in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| I didn't, I misunderstood, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| So you're saying that you don't believe that they can cross safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| that provisions can't be made to cross the street safely without going into this interior crossing facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1877)|
| 0:31:24| I would say that's one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Dr. Richard Rose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| Dr. Rose, the time is 737.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| Give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| I'm Dr. Dick Rose, 519 Mellon Road, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1901)|
| 0:31:46| I've been practicing or working at Fort Sanders for about 26 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| I'm a primary care internist with the summit group there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Fort Sanders has been providing care for Knoxville, as you saw, for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| particularly for the people of South Knoxville, East Knoxville, Northwest, and Bearden areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1920)|
| 0:32:06| And as new hospitals have sprung up, it has stayed there, and the doctors who practice there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| have continued to practice caring for the people who access us primarily from those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| We're landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| We're not in a pasture where we can build more buildings easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| My own group occupies an entire floor of one of the old buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| We want to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| We don't even have a place to put another doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| We can't do it without a new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| We need the new buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| This is true of several of the groups there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| As doctors have been encouraged by other health systems to move to Farragut and Powell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1959)|
| 0:32:44| we've stayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| We're taking care of the people of the city, and we really need this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| Now, I'm not an architect, although I, with Dr. Casey, have sat in more meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| than I really ever wanted to, to look at plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| And it is my understanding from all the plans I've seen for the last seven or eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1978)|
| 0:33:04| as we've tried to come up with something that would work, this is the best one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| This is the one that will actually work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| And we need this building if this hospital is to grow and to survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Because in this environment, this climate, if you don't grow and survive, you wither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| And we've seen that happen in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Mr. Altshuler talked about a lot of the things we have at Fort Sanders Regional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| that we don't have anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| This hospital really is a benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| And with newer hospitals, prettier, shinier buildings being put up outside the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| we are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| We're still doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| And I think most of my colleagues who are here and who aren't here would agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| we want to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| We don't want to move to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| We like practicing where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| We like taking care of the people we take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| And it is my recommendation, my wish, my desire that you all would support us in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2036)|
| 0:34:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2045)|
| 0:34:11| Mike Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2051)|
| 0:34:23| Mr. Clark, the time is 740.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2066)|
| 0:34:27| And you have up to five minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Thank you, Mike Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| I live at 156 Chapman View Drive in Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| And I own Old College Inn at 2204 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| Just kind of short and sweet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| I worked ten years in the tourist industry in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| Lots of growing pains up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Roads closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Huge road projects with massive amounts of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| And businesses survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| People learn new routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| I sent a little memo to that effect a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| I just feel like the pros outweigh the cons here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| I think you'll have a very good economic impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| My business relies a lot on, we kind of jokingly say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| Monday through Friday it's the suits and the scrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2114)|
| 0:35:17| You know, we have people in there, they're either in a coat and a tie or they got their scrubs on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| Of course, on the weekend we rely heavily on student business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| But that business goes away four months out of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| A lot of people don't realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| They get a whole month during December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| And they get three months from May to mid-August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| Our sales actually do decrease by about 25 to 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| And a project of this scope can help stabilize the year-round business in our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2144)|
| 0:35:50| I think it will have a very good impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| Also, there will be some short-term inconvenience and people learning new routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| But I think people are very intelligent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| They can find out new routes, work around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| And also, through some meetings that I have attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| I think there's going to be a willingness for Fort Sanders to work with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| both the city and individual businesses and other types of groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2175)|
| 0:36:21| to maybe do some parking and do some other things that can help enhance the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| As the Cumberland Avenue project moves along and other downtown projects move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| And also, one other note is, you know, as the national economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2191)|
| 0:36:36| and certain economies and cities are really struggling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| I think that an opportunity for this city to have a corporation invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| a pretty significant amount of money is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| Because a lot of cities would kill for that opportunity right now in these economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| That ends the list of individuals who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| In favor, Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| Before we go on to hear other comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| did anyone from the Covenant Group bring a cross-sectional drawing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| I know at the workshop we were provided with a schematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| But it's difficult to understand the necessity of this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| absent a bridge or a tunnel without understanding the schematic cross-section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2246)|
| 0:37:27| The architects have one that shows what we're asking for here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| plus alternatives that have been suggested and they're going to pass it out right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2256)|
| 0:37:45| Any further questions right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| While he is passing this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| I will go ahead and let Mr. Randall DeFord know that he is next up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2272)|
| 0:37:58| And if we could get a ñ excuse me, if I could have a copy there also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2278)|
| 0:38:05| She's going to keep that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| If you'll hold just for a second, Mr. DeFord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| does anybody at this juncture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| obviously we can come back to this document here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| at this juncture have any questions about the handout at this juncture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Seeing no lights, we obviously can come back to that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| Mr. DeFord, the time is 744.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| You have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Randall DeFord, 1511 Laurel Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| I apologize in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| I'm feeling unusually emotional this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2318)|
| 0:38:41| and I hope that won't get in my way or yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I'm willing to bet that most of us here don't believe in big government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| and that most of us believe that government should be a tool of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| to more efficiently accomplish our collective goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| In the 12 years that I have been actively trying to revitalize Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| and other inner city neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| there has been close to $100 million invested in the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| through building, construction, and renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| You might expect with that tremendous investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| that Fort Sanders has become a better place to live, work, and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| You might be tempted to expect that there had been a dramatic investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| in services and infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| that safety and security were greatly improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| for Knoxville's most populated neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| On the contrary, for those of us who are owner-occupants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| or mature long-term renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| for those of us who are closer to retirement than graduation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| for those of us who seek safety and security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| rather than the closest keg party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| for those of us who would rather stumble into bed than home from the strip,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| for those of us who seek a better place to live, work, and raise a family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| the quality of our lives in Fort Sanders has declined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| The Fort Sanders neighborhood is a sad example of our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| time after time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| supporting the big guy or the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| over the little guy, the small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| and the weary group of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| My neighbors and I believe that this is a short-sighted approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| to city planning, neighborhood building, and revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| We hope that you will, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| That is why my neighbors and I have organized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| the Fort Sanders Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| We seek to pull our resources together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| and to partner with other stakeholder groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| such as Covenant and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| to revitalize our own neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Last December, the mayor, in his inauguration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| spoke of his accomplishments, rightly so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| and of the plans for the next four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| He singled out the revitalization of Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| as one of those priorities in an interview after the speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| And in his program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| he once again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| said what we know is his mantra,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| that he wants to make Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| not only a good city, but a great city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| and the best place in America to live, work, and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| I'm a believer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| After 12 long years, I'm still committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| to making Knoxville the best place in America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2491)|
| 0:41:34| to live, work, and raise a family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| And I believe that the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| should be part of that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2500)|
| 0:41:43| Tonight, I ask all of you, city council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| to recommit to that effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| but in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| That plan I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2512)|
| 0:41:55| and in more detail in my letters to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| the one where a resident-led community development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2518)|
| 0:42:01| actively invests in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| that's it, that's the only plan for our neighborhood's revitalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| You can't scatter corn kernels on a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| and expect to feed the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| and neither can you revitalize a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| through community development and effort and investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| If you have any inclination to close 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| please don't allow this closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| of a public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| to be yet one more big government giveaway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| As voters and residents of Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2551)|
| 0:42:34| we value our city's assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| We understand that our city already struggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2557)|
| 0:42:40| to provide enough codes enforcement officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| police and fire personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| As business and property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| we value our city's assets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| We value this piece of property that we're discussing tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| and ask that you value it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| If you have any inclination to close 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| please postpone tonight's vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| And send this proposal back to the drawing board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| with the request that our city's assets be valued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| be invested back into the Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| through this new tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| the Fort Sanders Community Development Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| I think Council Member Becker has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| I want to put aside what you actually recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| which is a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2612)|
| 0:43:35| and ask the question a little more directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| If we can improve the office building isn't built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2618)|
| 0:43:41| do you think we should still vote against the road closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| If you're not willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| to value the property involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| then I would lean in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2630)|
| 0:43:53| And the reason is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| it is completely unfathomable to me as an architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| that an $80 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| would begin construction and yet hinge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| on this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| And it is further unfathomable to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2648)|
| 0:44:11| that there would be an $80 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| that would hinge on one small piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| and they would expect that property for free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2657)|
| 0:44:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Mr. James T. Garland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| Thank you for coming, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| The time is 7.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Give us your name, address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| My name is Jim Garland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| I live at 210 13th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| I've been a resident of Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| for 41 years, more or less, most of that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I have a degree in architecture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| and I used to have a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| a traffic control system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| during my work and while in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| The way we got to where we are right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| is back in the 1990s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| an out-of-town developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| tried to move into Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| to take over the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| We mobilized the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and we told Victor Ashe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| that Fort Sanders was worth saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| The mayor came up with the Hold the Fort Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| whereby there was a historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| placed over Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Home demolitions were banned temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Trees couldn't be cut down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and the whole idea was to go to the planning agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and come up with a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| for the growth and development of Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Towards that goal, there have been numerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| task forces and planning agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| that got involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| and we have come up with various plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| that work together for the advancement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| of Fort Sanders and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| If you look at the traffic flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| on the west side of Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Fort Sanders is divided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| into east and west by 17th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| You have numbered streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| 17th through 23rd Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| that handle the north-south traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Not all of those streets flow through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| from Grand Avenue on the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| to Cumberland Avenue on the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| The ones that do are 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| 20th and 21st are very narrow streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| and are heavily congested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| with hospital traffic and other traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| that is local to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| and they are each one way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| 20th Street goes north, 21st Street goes south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| Most of the north-south traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| is carried by 17th, 19th, and 22nd Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| If we close 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| we will put that traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| onto 17th or 22nd Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| Now what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| It means your Cumberland Avenue corridor plan is dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| The whole idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| of the Cumberland Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| is that we're going to have three lanes and not four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| But what that basically means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| is we're going to have one lane east and one lane west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| And it's very important to time the traffic signals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| so that traffic keeps moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| If we change 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| by closing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| it's not going to work correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| It's going to take a whole complete redesign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| What is the impact of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| It's a big impact, a very negative impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| on Fort Sanders, the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| the air site, the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| downtown business, downtown residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| downtown redevelopment, and the South Knoxville waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| because the Cumberland Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| will feed traffic through from West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| into all of these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2909)|
| 0:48:37| The whole idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| of closing 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| from a hospital's entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| from a building in one block where the hospital exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2926)|
| 0:48:49| into the next block, into another building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| is a very strange request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| And I don't believe we have a precedent for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| I don't think it's ever been done in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| and I don't think it's been done in other cities either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| A hospital is a publicly accessible building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| and moving its entrance to another building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| is strange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| You have one more minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| It could set a precedent if you approve this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| for anybody in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| to buy the building in the next block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2963)|
| 0:49:26| move their entrance over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and say, hey, we have to close the intervening street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| because nobody can, because whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| I don't think you want to set that precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| I don't think you want to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| I don't think you want to lose the Cumberland Avenue corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| I don't think you want to throw out all the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2984)|
| 0:49:47| for Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| and so I don't see why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| you would approve closing 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| Mr. Jim Blitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Thank you for coming out, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| The time is 7.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| You have up to five minutes to give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Jim Blitner, 3819 Glenfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| I listened with interest the other night at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| and I was somewhat interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| because as I told many of you who were there then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I've either lived and worked in that neighborhood since 1958.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I have a history of what's gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| and I learned the one-way streets, the way they've gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| the way they haven't gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3037)|
| 0:50:40| Laurel Street, when I worked safety patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| at the corner of 21st and Laurel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| was one way, the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| And so as I sat there, I asked a few questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| turning to learn more about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| and the question that came to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| was we're talking about closing 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| Now, it was changed fairly recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| to two ways with northbound traffic also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| Well, the question to me was why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Why was it changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Why did the plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| I tried to find out with traffic engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| and didn't have much luck these last couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| I was, however, able to contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| two members of the UT Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| one who has headed the third shift| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| and one who's headed one of the other shifts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| and I asked them, I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| why was it changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I said, well, you know, I can't tell you 100%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| because I might not be remembering this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| but they both said for access to the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| It was needed to have better access to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| and so that's why 19th was done so it could go up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| So I just tried to look at the grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| and what made sense to me was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| I'm a little concerned about what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| by closing 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| First of all, I think an ambulance driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| is going to have no problem getting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3133)|
| 0:52:16| because he knows the route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| but if you're headed to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| and you don't know 100% where you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| particularly with the one-way streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| if you've got 19th open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| you've got a direct shot right in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| And the other thing is I've sat in the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3154)|
| 0:52:37| over at UT on a gurney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| and saw a flurry of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| and I saw everybody go into the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| and I saw them bring a guy in and he didn't make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3166)|
| 0:52:49| and I talked to that driver that brought him in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3169)|
| 0:52:53| and when you think about closing 19th Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| the timing will be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| because if you're coming from the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| southeast, 17th Street, that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| you can't go up Clinch and go down 19th to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| You can't go up 18th to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3188)|
| 0:53:11| because Laurel runs the opposite direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| You've got to go several blocks out of your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| You may have to go up to Highland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| and shoot in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| Now that's if you're an ambulance driver| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| and you know where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| So if 19th is closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| I would ask that you do some hard consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| about moving access to that emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| or at least getting it very well advertised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| so that there is a quicker way to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3222)|
| 0:53:45| because it's going to be a hard way to get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| I asked that you provide the elevation studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3229)|
| 0:53:52| and you did that and I'm glad you did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| because I think council will benefit greatly from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Is it a possibility to tunnel under 19th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| I don't know. I don't know if that's been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| What I do know is that over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| with that lake department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| I've been involved in a fair number of projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| and sat with architects and how many times I've been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| we run into some constraints that you guys don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| That building committee's got to tell us how much money we can spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| and if we go over that, then you've got to jump through a lot of hoops to get there again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| You don't have quite those constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| although we do understand your financial constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| But what I've found is there's always other ways to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| and I sat here Thursday night and heard at least two architects say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| you know, there's other ways to do this. It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| I was extremely disappointed tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| to hear that this project won't go forward if this doesn't go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| I think everyone wants to see Fort Sanders prosper and grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| I thank you for hiring me to help me pay some of my college expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| That was great. I really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| But, you know, that disappointed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| because there are ways to make things happen if people will work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| and I think it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| I think you may need a little bit more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| I would remind you that you have prospered and you need new physician space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| but you've got two physicians building that currently are not connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| Yeah, one more minute, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3318)|
| 0:55:21| One being connected now with a walkway above. It was not originally that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| And then another one that's not connected at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| So I think you have been able to survive without that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| And I'd just like one other thought for you to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| for you to consider, counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| with what has been proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3339)|
| 0:55:42| we know that it will impact traffic. There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| But we also know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| Coach Witzel has got another project coming forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| that there's going to be massive construction on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| There's going to be some things that are going to change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| What's going to happen with the traffic when that happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Nineteenth's closure up there will affect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| And I'd just like to say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| I hopefully don't have to head to that emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| But if I do, I hope there's an easy way to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| And I hope that you will continue to prosper there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| And I hope that you can find an alternative way to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| with your building that you have. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| John Haas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3385)|
| 0:56:32| Thank you for coming. The time is 8.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| John Haas, 2215 Highland Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37916.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| I've got a couple things to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3402)|
| 0:56:45| One of the first things I want to do is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| I want to ask everyone who's representing Fort Sanders here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| and is against this road closure to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| These are all owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| of houses in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| And I am one of those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| Now I'd like to ask any doctors here that live in Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| to stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| I don't think there are any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| One of the first things that I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3433)|
| 0:57:16| is the argument by the hospital and their lawyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| is that this would make it, quote, easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| for them to do this project. They didn't say impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| He did allude to the fact that the project would be canceled if you guys voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| I think he's bluffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| I think they want to get what they want and they're going to try to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| But for us to basically...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Well, what they said is they said it would make it easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3457)|
| 0:57:40| to finance or that the financing hinged on you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| granting them part of 19th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| If that's the case, I think it's a pretty weak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3466)|
| 0:57:49| financial plan for the hospital to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| that they rely on the city to give them a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| of the city property and that the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| pay to maintain to grow their hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| They have multiple parking lots around these buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| more than I can count, at least a half a dozen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| if not more, some of them entire city blocks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| that could easily be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| They're just surface lot parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| They just built a nice big garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Why isn't there four more stories of offices on top of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| There's plenty of room there for this hospital to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| No one's saying they can't bridge over a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3506)|
| 0:58:29| And really, what's the difference between going up another floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| in an elevator to cross 19th Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I think it's insignificant as far as time is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| You would still have through traffic for pedestrians,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| for vehicles, and you'd still be able to get your people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| back and forth across the breezeway and allow traffic underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| Of course, we've talked the domino effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3527)|
| 0:58:50| If we close this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| you're going to be asked to close another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| And when do you say no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| The Children's Hospital may come to you, or another business may come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| What if a business on the Strip, two businesses across the street from each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| say, you know what, we need to close 18th Street at Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| because it would help us do more business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| I think there's a fine line here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| and I don't want to see you guys cross that line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| without really looking into what it's going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| for the rest of, not only Fort Sanders, but the rest of the neighborhoods in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| So, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3568)|
| 0:59:31| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3571)|
| 0:59:34| I believe that completes the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Yeah, that completes the list of speakers on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3577)|
| 0:59:40| And you have a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Mr. Seymour, do you want to wait after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| That can hold for two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3590)|
| 0:59:53| Councilman Blanton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3593)|
| 0:59:56| Councilman Blanton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| Time is 8.06, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| You have up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Kevin Zirkle, 6921 Sherwood Drive, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| Counting my father, my grandfather, and myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| we've been physicians in East Tennessee since 1901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Had an office at Fort Sanders on 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| I've watched the downtown hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| go from really being the premier site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3629)|
| 1:00:32| being really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| down compared to the suburbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| If you look at Memphis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| all the hospitals have moved out of Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| They're no longer in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| I had a patient today when I was walking through the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| looking for the Starbucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Well, we know where the Starbucks is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| It's out where the free parking is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| Our hospital staff average age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| has probably increased at least 10 years while I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3663)|
| 1:01:06| I'm part of a surgical group that's all through the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3666)|
| 1:01:09| I've been able to watch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| where the salaries go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3673)|
| 1:01:16| when we try to recruit somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| You know, where do they want to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| They want to go where the good salaries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| where the pretty hospitals, where the Starbucks is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| This staff views this move as critical for our future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| I was chief of staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| at Fort Sanders in 1994 when this project started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| I've been working on this for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3701)|
| 1:01:44| I can't tell you how many committees I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I don't know how many architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| I don't know how many plans I've seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| I think this is critical for downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| for our hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3716)|
| 1:01:59| If we don't go ahead with this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3719)|
| 1:02:02| I think we're going to lose our big chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| to keep this as a viable unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| When I started, when I was on the board as chief of staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| we had a multi-hundred million dollar endowment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| that's been used to build hospitals elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| This is our chance to get money back in our hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| I really don't want to see it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3744)|
| 1:02:27| Council Member Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3747)|
| 1:02:30| Yes, I was just going to make an observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| Thank you, doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| I don't have a question unless someone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| We had a very lengthy workshop on Thursday evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| which was very helpful, I think, to all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| to hear the different presentations that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| and the different comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| It's just been my thought process since Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| that, gee, we had many of the department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| of the city administration there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| but because of the time that was given to public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3784)|
| 1:03:07| basically, there were no comments made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| by the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| The comments tonight, particularly of Mr. Garland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| Mr. Blattner, and Mr. Haas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| have made me wonder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| if anyone from the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3802)|
| 1:03:25| would like to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3805)|
| 1:03:28| It comes to mind that perhaps Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| would like to respond, perhaps Mr. Wetzel or Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| And, frankly, I would really appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| hearing from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| if they have something they would like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| Council Member Pelo, I'd be happy to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| to the issue for the administration this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| The administration has looked at this for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| tried to look at all sides and tried to work with all sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| as this process has gone on since last spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3836)|
| 1:04:00| to the Cumberland Avenue Advisory Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| We've found that we would be supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| of the closure of this one block and 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3846)|
| 1:04:09| because it furthers at least three administration goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3849)|
| 1:04:12| that we've tried to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3852)|
| 1:04:15| One of those, the first one, would be the goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| of economic development in the core neighborhoods around downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| There's been a major commitment here to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| to the downtown north area, to the Cumberland Avenue area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3864)|
| 1:04:28| We're afraid that this move isn't made tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| that we'll be taking a move towards disinvestment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| as opposed to investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| So, for economic development reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| we think it's a very important thing for downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| and its downtown neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Also, during this period of time over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| and more specifically as we moved into this year in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| there's been work towards building strong community partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3892)|
| 1:04:56| With the city, with the hospital, with the neighborhood groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| and with the Cumberland Avenue Merchants Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3899)|
| 1:05:02| The biggest product of that partnership effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3902)|
| 1:05:05| has been the Cumberland Avenue Quarter Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| and the Cumberland Avenue Road Project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| which you'll see on your agenda later on tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| We're going to hopefully move forward there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| to build a kind of street that we think would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| conducive to the long-term future good of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3920)|
| 1:05:23| It's going to accommodate pedestrians better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| It's going to accommodate other forms of transportation better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| Hopefully, it's going to accommodate a more village-type lifestyle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| than just a through street at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| So, that would be one of the first ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| There's been a partnership working with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| on 16th Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| They've worked to create a pedestrian corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| from Cumberland up to the new sorority housing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| That's another partnership that we've worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| Working through this process on this potential road closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3954)|
| 1:05:57| Ann Wallace and I have been to a number of meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| where things have been discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| We've tried to see if there are compromised positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3963)|
| 1:06:06| or if there are positions that could work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| We've committed as a city to continue to work on a planning study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| with the Fort Sanders Neighborhood Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3972)|
| 1:06:15| We have a transportation plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| We'll have another road study as part of the Cumberland Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| We have worked with shared parking with the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| There's very good movement towards the shared parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| which is crucial to make Cumberland a park-and-walk district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| We have good partnerships there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| I think there's been some good words out of Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| and Covenant Hospital to the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=3997)|
| 1:06:40| about making pedestrian access on 18th and 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| and working to try to work on the perimeters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| of what would potentially be their new campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| to make that more enticing than it is at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| So partnerships we've worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4012)|
| 1:06:55| and that's certainly a major goal of this administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| The third one is the issue of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| We're talking about closing one block of one city street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| and hold that into balance to a $70-$100 million investment project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| The traffic studies all show that the impacts will be minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| and that's the development of the medical office building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4036)|
| 1:07:19| the closure of 19th Street, and the work on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4039)|
| 1:07:22| So we feel good about the connectivity issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| MPC's also done a study that we haven't talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| on connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| They have a connectivity index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| I won't go into how you get there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| but basically we had a 1.6-something on our connectivity index in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| You do the math, we're still in that 1.6 area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| and that's considered good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| So the point is we would still have good connectivity in Fort Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| The grid is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| It is one block of this grid that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| taking out balanced against the economic development opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4075)|
| 1:07:58| the partnership opportunities that we'll pursue from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4078)|
| 1:08:01| So with all these, we think it's a good move for the city at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Well, there seems to be a lot of concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4084)|
| 1:08:07| and I think rightly so, with the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| that this in some way is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| the beginning of a domino effect, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| for street closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Would someone like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| Street closures have to be taken on their own merit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| as they come up at each point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| I don't think it sets a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| It certainly says we want this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| If something comes forward, you have to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| Street closures aren't as good as they are at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| I don't think it's wise to say we'd never close another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| I think the only thing you can say is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4124)|
| 1:08:47| we'll take each and every one on their merit as they come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4127)|
| 1:08:50| But certainly at this point, there has been no indication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4130)|
| 1:08:53| that other street closures are going to be requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4133)|
| 1:08:56| in connection with this expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| There was talk, I guess early in the summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| we talked about the traffic studies and requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| we would require them to do before they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4148)|
| 1:09:11| A week or so later, they came back and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4151)|
| 1:09:14| we're not interested, we're not going to go forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| That has been looked at and it's not alive for this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| At this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| I'm going to go back and see if Dr. Lyons or Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| have any comments they would like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| because I felt that they had sat through a long evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| and if they were just itching to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| I'd like to hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| I don't know if I'm itching to say anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| but I will just build on a couple of comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| that Mr. Wetzel mentioned and that is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Obviously, street closings do not set a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4188)|
| 1:09:51| They're on almost every council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| The council closed a number of streets, say in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| for the Ameristeel improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| We have a couple tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| In terms of the hospital design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| there was much discussion of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| and I think everybody would concede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| there are many ways that it's possible to build a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| What is not possible is to build the kind of hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| necessary for the next decades of medical care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| required by physicians as you have heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| and that I think we have been working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4225)|
| 1:10:28| the architects have tried ways to not threaten the viability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4228)|
| 1:10:31| of the kind of hospital that physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| and medical professionals find necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4234)|
| 1:10:37| and are convinced that every effort has been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| and that this request is reasonable, unavoidable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| and that to get the kind of final product that's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4243)|
| 1:10:46| and we think it's an excellent project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4246)|
| 1:10:49| and is also important for the Cumberland Avenue project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| The traffic studies have shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4252)|
| 1:10:56| that there is not a deleterious effect by doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| on either pedestrian or another study on pedestrian traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| as well as vehicular traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| and the additional investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| the number of physicians and other medical professionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4268)|
| 1:11:11| who would be able to avail themselves of the housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| that we think will be constructed on Cumberland later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| the impact on the kind of positive businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| that we'd want to move in and be attracted to Cumberland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| the partnership we have established with the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| as well as the university that, as Bob said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| is already bearing fruit and benefited Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| as is shown in the great improvement with the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4293)|
| 1:11:36| and the safety issues that were addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| I think it's just the first step in an ongoing partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| and we're absolutely committed to working with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| neighborhood groups, planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| seeing the impact of everything as it goes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4308)|
| 1:11:52| as we proceed along with the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| We think it's unprecedented to have that kind of cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| and are very enthusiastic about the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| and the likelihood of moving forward after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4324)|
| 1:12:07| I guess you're left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| I don't know if you have anything further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I think the two previous gentlemen have done very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| but I'd be happy to answer a specific question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| I don't know if anyone else does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| Apparently not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| I think you can save it for another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| I had most of my questions answered just now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| but I think one of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Mr. Blattner brought up the issue of 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| and the ways that that presents a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| You heard the potential criticism there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| Do you have any comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| Well, I think as we move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| if this is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| then it's incumbent upon the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| and the hospital to provide appropriate communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| because it's in all of our interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| to get patients in the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| I think that really goes without saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| and we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4401)|
| 1:13:24| I actually have another question for Mr. DeFord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| It goes to the idea of postponing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| the idea of delaying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| I like how you spoke of it a little earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| talking about valuing the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| I've heard some of it at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| about some of the mechanics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| What's the cost everybody having to divert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| What's the additional driving, walking time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| What's the lost value?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Sort of putting all that in dollar figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| But I got sort of a two-part question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| One is to talk a little more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| what you mean by valuing the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4444)|
| 1:14:07| beyond just putting a dollar figure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| Mr. Alstruler has said if you don't close the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| we're not building the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| So help me know what we get at the end of the delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| that helps me make a decision about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| because that seems a pretty straightforward question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| on what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| Does the question make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| I know you're good at answering these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| so I'm going to trust that you'll fly with this a little as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| The last question first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| Nobody in this room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| nobody in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| wants to stop Covenant's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| We've had times of being good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| or having good relationships with Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| and times of stressful relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| but nobody is after stopping the hospital's project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| And so at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| there is a way to accomplish the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4507)|
| 1:15:10| of both Covenant and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| Back to the first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Value is of course the value of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4516)|
| 1:15:24| And there's the value to the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4524)|
| 1:15:27| and citizens of Knoxville in being delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| as they try to maneuver through the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| or to the hospital for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| In terms of staff of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| But there's a greater value at risk here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| and it's a value that's been devalued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4542)|
| 1:15:45| or overlooked for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| And that's the value that this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| this city places on the Fort Sanders neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| the most densely populated neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| certainly in Knoxville, probably the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| larger than most towns in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| And yet the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| as Councilwoman Roddy so eloquently pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| a couple weeks ago in speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| about codes enforcement of signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4573)|
| 1:16:16| the resources of this city are so stretched| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4576)|
| 1:16:19| that it's hard to pick and choose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| if you're an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| whether it's codes enforcement officer or KPD officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| what's the priority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| And our neighborhood often just gets left to the side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| time after time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| There's a piecemeal approach to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| which we've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| One project will come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| and sure, in the future if Children's comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| and wants to close 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| or when UT comes and wants to close 13th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| as they've mentioned in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| on their own merits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| But what happens is we've been on its own merits to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| We barely have a neighborhood left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4626)|
| 1:17:09| And so you can let the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| totally disintegrate and be nothing but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| modern student housing complexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4635)|
| 1:17:18| and I think what you'll have over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| is a police state that will not be safe for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| It'll be like the free-for-all we had last spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| where the students attacked the officer down on Highland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| I don't think it'll be safe for the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| it won't be safe for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| and those old folks like us will have moved out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| So there's a value to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| My mantra, you've heard it a million times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| is Fort Sanders is Knoxville's front porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| Right now that front porch has a torn up sofa| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| and a refrigerator on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| But it can be something that we're all proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| It can be an asset for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| It can be an asset for the hospital and the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| A great place for staff to live, to walk, to work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| to save gas, to get exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| to take pride in their neighborhood and bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| into a better state, reduce absenteeism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4693)|
| 1:18:16| I think Fort Sanders has potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| and I think a compromise could be worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| Council Member Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| Maybe someone from the hospital can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Mr. Bletner brought up the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| or the concern that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| isn't it in the best interest of the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| to have access from both ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| instead of emergency vehicles having to enter from the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| You obviously thought through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| and decided that it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| I'm Darrell Calloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| I'm the Director of Construction for Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| My address is 5111 Windcroft Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee 37914.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4743)|
| 1:19:06| The plan that's currently proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| accomplishes a separation between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| our front door traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| our pedestrians and vehicular traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| coming to a new drop-off point at our front door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| which will be on Clinch Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| which will be ADA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| It separates that traffic from the emergency traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| that we intend to route through Laurel Avenue from behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| We purposely have separated emergency traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| accessing our ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| from general public trying to get in our front door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| We've reviewed this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| with the local providers of emergency ambulance services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| and they are in agreement with our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So the actual drivers themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| feel comfortable with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| Council Member Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4802)|
| 1:20:05| I wonder if one of the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| or whoever handed out the cross-sectional drawing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| to us could answer some questions about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| This is a document that I would have liked to have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| on Thursday when we were trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| kind of wrap our arms around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| why this is such a necessity for the new building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4824)|
| 1:20:27| And I'm looking at the first page of your handout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| which shows the proposed design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| and I guess what I see is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| your primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| prerogative is to get folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4839)|
| 1:20:42| from a certain level of your parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| that I guess is going to be designated to serve the emergency department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| straight across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| So a person who would walk into the medical office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| to the new front entrance of the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| would still have to go down and around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4860)|
| 1:21:03| to get to the old hospital building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| Let me say also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| my name is Craig Holloway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| and my address is 304 Mansfield Court, Franklin, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4876)|
| 1:21:19| 37069| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| Again, when we talk about separation of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| we are trying to divert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| the public visiting traffic to that lower level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Which lower level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| Which is in your section there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| it's marked lower garage level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| So yes, the public would come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| the front door on the first floor of the new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| down the elevators to the very bottom floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| and make a transition over to the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4910)|
| 1:21:53| which is the same level as the current main lobby of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| So if someone drops me off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| at the new front entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| of the medical office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| and down an elevator and across a tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4926)|
| 1:22:09| which I guess is at tunnel level at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| and I come out at the present entrance level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| of the old hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Yes, the goal is that there will be a corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| created through the existing hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| that takes you back to the primary public elevator lobby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| is where we're really trying to get you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Most of those patients are families and visitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| so they're trying to get to the primary public elevator core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4954)|
| 1:22:37| of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| So that new corridor will lead you to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| Okay, I'd like to look at the sectionals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| that were rejected in terms of being inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| and the second one shows a tunnel connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| On this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| again the pedestrian who is dropped off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4975)|
| 1:22:58| or walks in the front door of the new entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| at the medical office building has the same path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| They go down two levels on the elevator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| and across to reach the original elevator bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| in the old hospital, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| So it's the emergency patients that are inconvenienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| by the tunnel design, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| And you show the emergency department parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5006)|
| 1:23:29| so they would go down one and over and up one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| according to your drawing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| Why is emergency department parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| not on the lowest level of the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| So they would park there and go straight across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| in the tunnel and up one and then there they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5024)|
| 1:23:47| I guess I still don't understand why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| and I see that the bridge is very inconvenient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| I see that it has a lot more elevators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5033)|
| 1:23:57| between floors on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| But page two, the tunnel design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| if the emergency department parking is moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| to the lowest level of the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| the folks trying to access the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| go across the tunnel just like they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| on your preferred design and they go up one level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| And I guess I don't understand other than the aesthetics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| of having this entrance facade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5061)|
| 1:24:25| why this was rejected as being untenable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Well, there's a couple of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| One of them goes back again to the separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5071)|
| 1:24:34| of traffic that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| between public visiting traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5077)|
| 1:24:40| and the traffic of some parent bringing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5080)|
| 1:24:43| a child who may be sick, hurt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| a family member who may be bringing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5086)|
| 1:24:49| a mom may be bringing in a husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5089)|
| 1:24:53| having some chest pains and so you're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| totally two different types of patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| So that's one perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| The other is, again, when you come to the emergency department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5102)|
| 1:25:05| you're looking for the most direct route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| the most observable route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| due to the fact that you could have incidences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5111)|
| 1:25:14| between the time you park your car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| and the time you make it to the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| and have patients park on a different level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| come over, have to wait on an elevator, go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| They're now in an area that is not observable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| by clinical staff, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| It's more of a public area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| Even if the public was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| now we've got an event happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| that's not on the same level as the ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| making it more inconvenient for the ED staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| So it's very important to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5148)|
| 1:25:51| a clear, direct path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| from the parking to the ED waiting room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| and that's what we've tried to accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| with the first design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| On the tunnel design, why can the tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| not be two layers underground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| so that you have two separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| corridors for these different populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5172)|
| 1:26:16| so that you maintain the design as you have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| for the emergency patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| They come in, they go straight across and up one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| and then the visiting patients actually go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| and put a second tunnel below the emergency tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| You're talking about like a parallel tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5191)|
| 1:26:34| that's on the same level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5194)|
| 1:26:37| Well, sure. You could have a parallel tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| on the same level or you could have a second tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| because this lowest level here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| as you can see on the left hand side of your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| there's no other floors below the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| And again, if you did parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| you're addressing one of the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| that we had about the separation of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| but you still haven't provided that clear, distinct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| observable path as patients are getting out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| of their cars in emergent situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| into the actual ED waiting room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5232)|
| 1:27:17| What is not clear and distinct and observable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| relative to your proposed plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| You park in a garage and you get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| and I assume you follow some kind of arrows or lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| and you go across to the ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| In a tunnel design, if you park on the same level as the tunnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| you follow some kind of arrows and lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| and you go across and then up one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| Again, if you can imagine yourself bringing your husband in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| who's having symptoms of chest pains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| and you're having to walk them through this tunnel area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| that's on the first floor, push an elevator button| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| wait on that elevator to come down, go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| We as architects try to put ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| in the position that we may be in one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| but also that patients are in every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| And again, we're looking to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5287)|
| 1:28:11| the most functional plan here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| that addresses the needs of our client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| but that also addresses that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| from various efficiency standpoints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| But in this particular plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5305)|
| 1:28:28| the one that's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| from a complexity standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| it's obviously more complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| functional flow, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5317)|
| 1:28:43| Yeah, I guess I just haven't heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| a strong case that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| the tunnel option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| makes the medical office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| incomplete or dysfunctional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5336)|
| 1:28:59| and I don't work in this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| and thank goodness I haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| been in an emergency situation recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| so I guess I don't understand the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| for that kind of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5352)|
| 1:29:15| Some of the medical staff might be able to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| more comments in addition to what I've made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| but we talked about on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| an example of an ED patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| or excuse me, a patient that's in a physician office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| that might have a symptom that needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| We talked about how that patient might migrate over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| Another one that we did not talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| is that there will be an ambulatory surgery center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5382)|
| 1:29:45| in this building as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| which represents the possibility of a patient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| who during that procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5391)|
| 1:29:54| has to be basically admitted at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5394)|
| 1:29:57| because of their condition deteriorating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5397)|
| 1:30:00| Again, the scheme that we've provided here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| gives direct access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| into not only ED| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5406)|
| 1:30:09| but also diagnostic imaging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| and the inpatient surgery floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5412)|
| 1:30:15| that's also on that first floor of the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| Any further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| from members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| Mr. Holloway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5431)|
| 1:30:36| Thank you for your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| That was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| That helps clarify some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| and some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5445)|
| 1:30:48| that I had in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| are at least more refined now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5451)|
| 1:30:54| I don't think they're all answered yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| but I trust that you'll do your best to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| I know you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| You're obviously a very competent professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5466)|
| 1:31:09| just an observation before I ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| You're talking about mothers bringing children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| to the ER at Fort Sanders Regional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| I think the reality is that's not going to happen very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| because a block away is a children's hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| and I would think that most parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| would bring their children to children's hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| if they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| They may not all be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| There may be some insurance requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| or something that don't allow them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5499)|
| 1:31:42| I don't know all the specifics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| but I would guess that most parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| probably would choose children's hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5508)|
| 1:31:52| As you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| the desirability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| to be able to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| patients from the doctor's offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5521)|
| 1:32:04| and the ambulatory surgery facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5524)|
| 1:32:07| in this new building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| you're saying that's obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| a preferable situation when you can move them as directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| and all that as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| At this hospital and most hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| but certainly at this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5542)|
| 1:32:25| there are already other physicians office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| that either connect or don't connect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| as was pointed out to the core building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| and none of those have the ready access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| as far as I can tell to the ER facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| It just seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| and you can correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| but it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| there's not a lot of evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| that that's essential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5572)|
| 1:32:55| to have that direct access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| in a physician's office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| or an ambulatory surgery facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| I know that that doesn't exist in most cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5584)|
| 1:33:07| and so would you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| that's sort of an ideal world situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| given that that's relatively uncommon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Well actually it's quite common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| and I think it applies not only to healthcare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| but it applies to most construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| that you see in some way or form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5606)|
| 1:33:29| meaning that if you go out and you take a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| and you want to create a new use for that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| be it a restaurant or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5615)|
| 1:33:38| you're going to be obligated to bring up certain codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| to that particular building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5621)|
| 1:33:44| and so as any healthcare project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| that we've taken on involves renovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| the areas that we're actually working in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5630)|
| 1:33:53| we strive to try to make that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| the most functional it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| and so one example is the ADA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| if we know there's ADA issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| it's time to fix them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| but it's a good time to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| from a disruption standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| just a total facility upgrade standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5654)|
| 1:34:17| so because something has not been a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| in the past like we talked about last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| on Thursday about accidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| maybe of people crossing the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| because you have an unsafe condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| or a condition that's not the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| doesn't mean that you ignore it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| you try to address those in a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| and that's what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5682)|
| 1:34:45| I understand. I guess what confuses me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| let me ask you another question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5688)|
| 1:34:51| first of all I know that your firm, that ESA does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| a lot of medical facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| that's the bulk of your business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5697)|
| 1:35:00| and I know that you do a lot of core hospital facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| realizing who the architect was a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| and if I remember correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| and you can correct me if I'm wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| but if I remember correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5712)|
| 1:35:15| you also do medical office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5715)|
| 1:35:18| freestanding medical office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| and freestanding ambulatory surgical facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| and are those facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| sometimes distinctly separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5727)|
| 1:35:30| or even miles from the closest hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| They are in terms of the desire of that particular client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| and the types of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| that that particular building may be providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5739)|
| 1:35:42| so you have to look at each project individually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| with respect to the services that are being provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| in that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I understand but including ambulatory service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| surgical facilities, excuse me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5754)|
| 1:35:57| those developments, those buildings, those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| are distinctly separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| at some distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| from any core hospital facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| and you have designed those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| and felt like that was inappropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| in your professional opinion as a licensed architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| do you believe that design work was appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| Appropriate for that client?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| In a variety of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| where you've designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| medical office space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| and ambulatory surgical facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| you believe that is appropriate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| Again, I'll say I believe it to be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| for that specific client's needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| Because that's what the client wanted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| That meets their functional needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| Can I please help Craig a little bit too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| as the administrator to answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| I think first of all let me clear up one misconception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| our office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| on the western side are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| one office building is connected to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| and that one building has a common connection to our hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| so in effect they are connected to our complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| That's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| I understand, but they're not directly connected to the emergency department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| Not to the emergency department, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| But they are connected directly to our complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| The other thing that I would like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| is that this building is unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| the one that we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| and that we're proposing to have an outpatient surgery center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| and other outpatient services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5863)|
| 1:37:47| that have connectivity and don't have to be wheeling patients in and out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| uncovered all the way up and down elevators, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| just because of the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| And I think the third thing that appears to be lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| on all this conversation is the physicians behind me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| and those that are still at the hospital tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| are independent practitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| They are independent business people who happen to practice medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| at our hospital and if we don't provide the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| to this building, they may not make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| And that's in fact what I think gets back to the core of this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| is what's it going to take to continue investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| of the medical community into our downtown hospital?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5903)|
| 1:38:26| I appreciate your comments, Mr. Altshuler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| Again, you said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| you don't want to have to ferry patients up and down elevators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| well, the new building is going to have elevators in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| the existing building is going to have elevators in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| all the services in either building are not all going to be on one floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| and I've never been in a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| or medical facility that didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| well, I may have been in one at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| but if a large facility doesn't have elevators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| that means it's even more spread out on one level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| in some suburban situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| and I don't think anybody's building core hospital facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| that are all one level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| I understand you want to do it as efficiently as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| but my point is that you've got to move people around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| and you've got to put them on elevators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| I think that's unavoidable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| and I don't see anything in this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| that does anything differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| you're just trying to get people to that second level of the core building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5967)|
| 1:39:30| as directly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| and I understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| and that's what you're trying to accomplish there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| and I think Councilman Roddy's made some good observations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| in terms of alternatives there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5982)|
| 1:39:45| but thank you for your response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5985)|
| 1:39:48| you done Councilmember Holcombe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5988)|
| 1:39:51| I'll come back to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| Councilmember Pelow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| Mr. Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=5997)|
| 1:40:00| I move that we approve item number 9E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6000)|
| 1:40:03| I second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| and now we're on the approval of 9E motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| Councilmember Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| I guess this is for Mr. Holloway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| going back to emergency room access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| and the closure of 19th street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| it would seem if I were in a true crisis situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6024)|
| 1:40:27| that I would want to just pull right up to the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| of the emergency room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| and get my patient in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| is 19th under this proposed plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| is a private vehicle allowed to access 19th via Laurel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6040)|
| 1:40:43| or is the only access to pull into the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| and then go across the connector and in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6046)|
| 1:40:49| there's a pull off part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| and a drop off lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| off what would be the remaining parts of 19th for that purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| if my patient is in complete distress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| or immobilized or not mobile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| I don't have a wheelchair or whatever I can pull in right to the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| Councilmember Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| I guess I got a couple just to move the discussion along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6073)|
| 1:41:16| at some level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6076)|
| 1:41:19| it sounds like we keep arguing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6079)|
| 1:41:22| I keep looking at the designs and I say you could do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6082)|
| 1:41:25| but I think Mr. Altshuler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| said it well a minute ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| that at some level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Fort Sanders has to build a hospital that attracts doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| if it wants to succeed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| and sometimes that requires things that are a little nicer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| that the bare bones doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| and I guess I'm still sort of concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| the postponement that Mr. DeFord talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| and how that helps at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| but to my mind at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| approving this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| I think something that I am willing to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| I'd like to hear somebody talk a little more about what a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| could accomplish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| for moving anything forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| because to me it only seems like a matter of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| and I don't know what value there is to postponing on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| I'm probably not the person to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| but I think it's been spoken to very explicitly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| for us both on Thursday evening and tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| but my comment would just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| I think it's been plainly put to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| that we have had delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| that this council has requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| and the neighborhood has encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| so that there could be opportunity for good communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| and I think that's a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| by having extremely detailed comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| and the ability to have very good questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| and answers and have everyone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| who has the answers that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6179)|
| 1:43:02| I want to make a comment toward value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| I thought Mr. Clark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6185)|
| 1:43:08| I thought Mike made some extremely interesting comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| that really speak to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| because while I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| so well the neighborhood's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| about devaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| perhaps we all just look at things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| somewhat differently and somewhat from a different position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| but in my mind this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| has had a great deal to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| with the continued success of that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| and you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| the good point was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| that UT is not in session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| 12 months out of the year basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| and businesses cannot survive there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| and have a 4 month hiatus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| I know our business couldn't survive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| if we took 4 months off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| and just waited for open door again in 4 months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| and to me it's very critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| businesses in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| if we're able to continue to maintain that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| and gee let's look at it from a city standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| the city can't afford to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| make the investment in the fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| if the fort doesn't have vitality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| and to me this hospital is just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| well it's a symbol of life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| it is life, it's life for this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6273)|
| 1:44:37| this hospital and this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6277)|
| 1:44:40| are going to become closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| and better neighbors and better partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| in this investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6286)|
| 1:44:49| that we've all made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6289)|
| 1:44:52| all of Knoxville has made an investment in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| I want us to continue to be in a position to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6295)|
| 1:44:58| I want us to continue just this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| I guess it was Randall said to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Scott to come over and see our park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| which I have to confess I have not visited in the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| and so I intend to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| I'm as excited as their residents are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6313)|
| 1:45:16| about the park because it's just such a vital part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6316)|
| 1:45:19| of Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6319)|
| 1:45:22| and I've talked to these gentlemen at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| I personally feel that they are making a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| to Knoxville certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| to downtown Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| I mean I would love to live this close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6334)|
| 1:45:37| to a major medical center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| I don't, it's several miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| for me to reach a hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| I think that is tremendous value for this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6346)|
| 1:45:49| it is critical value to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| city of Knoxville to continue to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6352)|
| 1:45:55| a very progressive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| state continuing to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6359)|
| 1:46:02| major hospital in the heart of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6362)|
| 1:46:05| and so I guess maybe that's where I come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| I try to look at that value as value for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6368)|
| 1:46:11| value for every taxpayer, value for every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| person who works at the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| every family that's touched in every way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6377)|
| 1:46:20| that many of you have been touched by the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6380)|
| 1:46:23| so my motion was made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| because I feel comfortable that we've had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| to have the answers brought to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| the willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| to give this council all the information we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| and I really think we're ready to move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6398)|
| 1:46:41| and frankly, let's go back to this business thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| I told my husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| on the way down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| I listened to the news this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| it was not at all encouraging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6413)|
| 1:46:56| I was very disturbed about the financial picture of this country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| and we spoke of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| it's already affected our personal lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| I do not want us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| delay this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6428)|
| 1:47:11| until we reach a point where the financial institutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| cannot meet the needs of a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6434)|
| 1:47:17| such as this and that's one thing that concerns me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| tremendously with any delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| I think we have to understand that this is a business venture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| a major venture that is being made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| in Knoxville and should benefit all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| so that's the reason I've chosen to support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| and I think all of you who know me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6455)|
| 1:47:38| know I love Fort Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6458)|
| 1:47:41| I'll continue to support the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| and I feel this entire council is committed to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6464)|
| 1:47:48| and the partnership that we hope to help you build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| you heard Dr. Lyons speak and Mr. Wetzel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| about the encouragement of the partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| between the neighborhood and the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| and I just think I'm ready to get on with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6480)|
| 1:48:03| make sure that this project can go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6483)|
| 1:48:11| Council Member Bailey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| Mr. Vice Mayor, I'd just like to explain myself here as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| to Councilman Pelo's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| we've discussed this for quite a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6500)|
| 1:48:23| and we've had quite a lengthy workshop Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| and a number of discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| and we've had the chance to talk to the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| and to experts and to look at alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| for 19th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| and when I look at the Fort Sanders area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| I see the student housing in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| and I see it as a hospital campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6524)|
| 1:48:47| and the hospital is a major component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6527)|
| 1:48:50| economically for that region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| and really for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6533)|
| 1:48:56| but more so with some of the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| expected closures of other hospitals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6539)|
| 1:49:02| to me this is a critical issue to our regional health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| and I think that's a responsibility we have to take seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| and we've looked at ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6548)|
| 1:49:12| I appreciate Mr. Wetzel's comments earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| and the administration's and Dr. Lyons and Mr. Wetzel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| I respect a lot when it comes to these sort of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| and when it comes to closing this block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6561)|
| 1:49:24| I think that this $80 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| $70 to $100 million project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| certainly is very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6570)|
| 1:49:33| and in my opinion warrants the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| so I don't think this is a slippery slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| I think this is something that's worthy of this block being closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| and I again appreciate the comments about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6582)|
| 1:49:45| the neighborhood, the village comments and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6585)|
| 1:49:48| and I think it's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| as some others have said something in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| that the neighborhood and the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| this will prove to be a very positive element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| well for this topic I've sat here silent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| but to be blunt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| my law firm represents Fort Sanders Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| I think good ethics calls on me to abstain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| from this matter and I'm going to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| matter of full disclosure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| I would like to say though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| that I don't know how this vote is going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| but if it goes forward tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| I certainly hope that Covenant Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| would work very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6634)|
| 1:50:37| with the neighborhood organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| to minimize the effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| that the neighborhood organization is feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| or believe they're going to feel in this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| I have faith that Covenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| will do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| Council Member Holquist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| Is Dr. Zirkle still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Sir, I know you're probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| tired of sitting through this whole meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| would you mind answering a couple more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6671)|
| 1:51:28| I'll just comment that I'm tired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| but it seems like we're coming to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| beginning of the end. It's been going on for 15 years for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| So I'm actually excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6697)|
| 1:51:45| Well I thought you might be a good one to ask some questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| since you've had so much history and you've been at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| for so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| Your concerns are that this new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| facility be built and be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| in a way that functions and connects well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| to the core hospital building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| and meets the needs of the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| to move back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| I guess that's a pretty fair statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| You may want to expound on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| Say whatever you want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| Well my main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| I'm not going to speak to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| which design is absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| the best. I'll be honest with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| I've seen probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| 10 different drawings in the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| 15 years. I'm talking committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| When I say 10 drawings, probably 10 revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| of each 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| I do not personally feel tunnels work very well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| Patients don't like them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| I think they're dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| We have a tunnel between Thompson and the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| People don't use it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| When you're driving around this hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| you better be driving slow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| because you've got a person over here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| that has their leg taken off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| that's walking across with 3 other people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| It's dangerous right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| My office has been on both sides of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| on this block. This is not a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| that you're going to drive very fast on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| I just feel that the patients and the families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| they don't like to be in tunnels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6815)|
| 1:53:38| One of the doctors was assaulted in one of the tunnels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6818)|
| 1:53:41| She took the knife away from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6821)|
| 1:53:44| I'm not really going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| go through the judgment of each particular plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6827)|
| 1:53:50| The fact is, people don't like to walk in tunnels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| when they don't have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| This is going to be a very busy building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| It's going to have more activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| than the other office buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| we want it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| This is an old campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| You've got older doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| They've been a little depressed by seeing what goes on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6854)|
| 1:54:17| My daughter drives out to Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| Everybody loves Turkey Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| You have to have patients that want to love to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| Baptist closed not because they didn't do good work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| They didn't have good doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| They didn't have smart administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| It closed because they had 80% Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| 10% Medicaid, 10% care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| and you couldn't make a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6881)|
| 1:54:45| to keep it going $4 million a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| We've got to figure out a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| to bring good patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| that can support the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| that don't really support the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| It has to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6900)|
| 1:55:03| Our practice has to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| If we don't, the good doctors, the smart guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| and women are going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6909)|
| 1:55:12| It's not the hospital that has the better patient population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6912)|
| 1:55:15| It's just a fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6915)|
| 1:55:18| I've got to be able to recruit younger people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6918)|
| 1:55:21| for my group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6921)|
| 1:55:24| Dr. Hyatt and I and Dr. Brenner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| and all of my other partners that are over 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| are going to have a great time finishing up our career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| and then we're going to lock the key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6933)|
| 1:55:36| That's what I'm interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6936)|
| 1:55:39| I've got to have this project done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| It's got to be nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| I've got to be able to compete with Park West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6945)|
| 1:55:48| I've got to be able to compete with Baptist West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6948)|
| 1:55:51| I've got to be able to compete with St. Mary's North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6951)|
| 1:55:54| I practice at St. Mary's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| You're talking about crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6957)|
| 1:56:00| I don't know if you've all been over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| It takes you 10 years as a doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| I don't want that on my campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6967)|
| 1:56:10| I want somebody to be able to come on the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| and know where to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| That's what we've got to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6976)|
| 1:56:19| If we don't, we're going to lose it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| We don't want another building down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6982)|
| 1:56:25| that doesn't have an occupant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| I know the people over there don't want that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| I'm not going to sit here and talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| or our group's in trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6994)|
| 1:56:37| I think everybody wants to see this building built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=6997)|
| 1:56:40| It'd be a great building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7000)|
| 1:56:43| I think that's what everyone has in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7003)|
| 1:56:46| Certainly what Covenant has in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| A building with high ceilings, a really beautiful entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| It's not the doctors that you've got to bring down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| The doctors follow the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| I want the people that drive the cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| and pay for the insurance to come down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| to support a practice where you can make enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7024)|
| 1:57:07| to get a top-flight guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| That's just the reality of the life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| They've got to build something that attracts the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7033)|
| 1:57:16| that want to come down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| instead of driving somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| I understand that, and it sounds like that's what we're going to get in this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| I think everybody's excited about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| Whether the second-level connection is built or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| the bulk of the people that go to that hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| and move from that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| or go to the doctor's office building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| or to the new main entrance in the new building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| into the core hospital building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| are going to go through that lower level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Whether it feels like a tunnel or whether it's well-lit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7069)|
| 1:57:52| those are design considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7072)|
| 1:57:55| That's a real challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| The bottom line from what I'm hearing from you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| is that it's got to be a great building that people want to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7081)|
| 1:58:04| and they've got to be able to get from one side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| from one building to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| in a way that they're comfortable doing so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7090)|
| 1:58:13| Those are the key issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| I think if we leave 19th Street open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7096)|
| 1:58:19| it will separate the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| We're already behind the eight ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| We've got to do something that attracts patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7105)|
| 1:58:28| people are proud of, it's attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7108)|
| 1:58:31| and it attracts the doctors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| I think that's the best design I've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| I don't think we can accomplish that if we leave the street open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7117)|
| 1:58:40| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| Am I the only one with my light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7126)|
| 1:58:49| Well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| Just one other thing that I'll bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| because we talked about this a lot at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| Council, those of you who were able to stay to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7138)|
| 1:59:01| got a lot of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| Those of you who weren't able to stay to the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| got a lot of great information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| I put in front of every council member's place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| essentially a transcript from some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| and this goes back to Councilman Becker's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| about he'd like to hear more about a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7159)|
| 1:59:28| At the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7168)|
| 1:59:31| the best thing to do may be to close this street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7171)|
| 1:59:34| I can't say absolutely it won't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| I can say that so far I'm not convinced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7177)|
| 1:59:40| that it's the best thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7180)|
| 1:59:43| It seems to me based on all the information we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| that the evidence is actually to the contrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| But because there's so many costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7189)|
| 1:59:52| external costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| not to the medical facilities themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7195)|
| 1:59:58| but to the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7198)|
| 2:00:01| that are going to be born by closing of this street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7201)|
| 2:00:04| Emergency access is one thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7204)|
| 2:00:07| Ambulance access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| We heard that the ambulances are going to come up Laurel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| and that creates potential problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7213)|
| 2:00:16| because Laurel has both 20th Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| which is one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| and Laurel which is one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7222)|
| 2:00:25| have a problem right now of people pulling up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| dropping off patients, picking up patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7228)|
| 2:00:31| If you go and observe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| there are times when it literally backs traffic up around the block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| and that doesn't have to happen much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| to impede ambulance access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7240)|
| 2:00:43| So the more direct route you have to the ER the better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7243)|
| 2:00:46| I think that's a really important consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7246)|
| 2:00:49| But beyond all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| what we don't really know yet is what the impacts are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| to the surrounding community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| And at the top of that list I would say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| I would place the Cumberland Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| We're looking at tens of thousands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| probably a couple of hundred thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| I don't remember the exact numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| or more square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| probably more than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| several hundred thousand perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| I don't remember the exact numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| of buildings on the Cumberland Avenue corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| a lot more intensive use than is there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| What we did is we paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| using state and federal dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| we paid Gladding Jackson to do the Cumberland Avenue plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| and that included a pretty effective model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7301)|
| 2:01:44| of the whole traffic system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7304)|
| 2:01:47| of Cumberland Avenue and the connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| and the connecting streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7310)|
| 2:01:54| The man who was the lead principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| the managing principal on that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| was also the one that we entrusted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7320)|
| 2:02:03| our biggest and most expensive project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7323)|
| 2:02:06| in the city of Knoxville to as far as transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7326)|
| 2:02:09| and street planning so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7329)|
| 2:02:12| transportation planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7332)|
| 2:02:15| That's the South Waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7335)|
| 2:02:18| and he's a nationally recognized expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| for what he does and what he knows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7342)|
| 2:02:25| You can read for yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7345)|
| 2:02:28| in these comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7348)|
| 2:02:31| He said that we should look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7351)|
| 2:02:34| for the revitalization of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7354)|
| 2:02:37| that we've heard about earlier this evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7357)|
| 2:02:40| for intensification of the density of the northern part of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7360)|
| 2:02:43| that's long range too but he also said before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| a lot of the hoped for impacts on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7366)|
| 2:02:49| revitalization are long range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7369)|
| 2:02:52| and they're not going to happen within five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| and that's what the current traffic studies look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| when there's very little additional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7378)|
| 2:03:01| on Cumberland Avenue and probably very little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7381)|
| 2:03:04| probably none anticipated within that study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7384)|
| 2:03:07| in the numbers provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| in Grand Avenue where there's significant development opportunity left there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| but the bulk of this will happen on Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| and it's a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7396)|
| 2:03:19| We have not really looked at that yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7399)|
| 2:03:22| and we have to look further out than five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7402)|
| 2:03:25| because very little is going to occur in terms of new development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| in the first five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| Mr. Kulash's observation was that we need to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| We must, if we're really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| concerned about getting our arms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7417)|
| 2:03:40| around those issues and understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7420)|
| 2:03:43| and preparing for future growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| and truly planning the way we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| then we're going to have to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7429)|
| 2:03:52| I asked Hollis Loveday about that and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7432)|
| 2:03:55| you can see from the notes he said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7435)|
| 2:03:58| they only looked five years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| Hollis Loveday from Wilbur Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7441)|
| 2:04:04| he's the transportation consultant for Covenant Health on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7444)|
| 2:04:08| As a result of that interchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| between Mr. Kulash and Hollis Loveday and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| Councilman Pelow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| observed that Ann Wallace from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| wanted to say something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| and if you look at her comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| what she said was, I just want to let you all know that as a part of the scope of services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| that we've outlined for the Cumberland Avenue detailed design work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| that's actually before council on Tuesday evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| we have contracted for, or are anticipating contracting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7476)|
| 2:04:39| a detailed traffic impact study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| and that's with the consultants that have been recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7482)|
| 2:04:45| to the city council for contracting for the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7485)|
| 2:04:48| detailed design work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7488)|
| 2:04:51| in addition to that we've also contracted with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| the TPO staff to do an additional traffic circulation study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| that's looking at traffic calming measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| that might need to be taken for the benefit of the neighborhood as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| and she goes on to say that these are going to be adequate to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7504)|
| 2:05:07| what's needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7507)|
| 2:05:10| and I think it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| irresponsible of us to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| without making sure that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7516)|
| 2:05:19| the best information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7519)|
| 2:05:22| and I think Mr. DeFord's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7522)|
| 2:05:25| for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| reflects not only these concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| but concerns about how the other issues in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| are going to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7534)|
| 2:05:37| issues that have been brought up time and again over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7537)|
| 2:05:40| and they've always been told we'll get to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| we're going to address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| we're going to address those at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7546)|
| 2:05:49| but we've got to move ahead with this current project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| whatever the project du jour happens to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| and if you look at the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| it's certainly 15 or 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7558)|
| 2:06:01| when the residents are here that are so passionate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7561)|
| 2:06:04| about maintaining and defending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| the quality of life in their neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7567)|
| 2:06:10| they've experienced this over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| 15, probably 20 years most of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7573)|
| 2:06:16| time and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7576)|
| 2:06:19| and they get promises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| and without hammering out how those promises are going to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| if the players don't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| if the city doesn't agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7588)|
| 2:06:31| if Covenant Health doesn't agree on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7591)|
| 2:06:34| there's no way to hold them to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| and I'd like to be able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| these are all folks of good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7600)|
| 2:06:43| and I know they're good people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| I'm not saying that but somehow or another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7606)|
| 2:06:49| historically it's always slipped away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7609)|
| 2:06:52| that opportunity has slipped away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7612)|
| 2:06:55| and it's back to business as usual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7615)|
| 2:06:58| and the only way you get around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7618)|
| 2:07:01| is to come to agreement on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7621)|
| 2:07:04| and if you give away everything without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| insisting on agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| you don't ever get there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| and as far as Cumberland Avenue goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7633)|
| 2:07:16| we're looking at hundreds of millions of dollars of investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7636)|
| 2:07:19| $280 something million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| my guess is it's going to be higher than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7642)|
| 2:07:25| a good bit higher probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7645)|
| 2:07:28| but that's going to happen over an extended period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7648)|
| 2:07:31| once the street's closed, it's closed forever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7651)|
| 2:07:34| we've got two contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7657)|
| 2:07:40| assuming council votes in the Vaughan and Melton contract tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7660)|
| 2:07:43| I would hope council will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7663)|
| 2:07:46| come to that shortly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7666)|
| 2:07:49| but we've got two contracts we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7669)|
| 2:07:52| that will address these issues in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| Ms. Wallace's own words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| and so the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7678)|
| 2:08:01| will it be a deal killer if we postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7681)|
| 2:08:04| I hear Covenant Health people say it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7684)|
| 2:08:07| I'm highly, highly skeptical that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7687)|
| 2:08:10| their census is going up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7690)|
| 2:08:14| on the hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7694)|
| 2:08:17| some of that's because of the emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7697)|
| 2:08:20| and other facility uses and needs by patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7700)|
| 2:08:23| that were going to Baptist Hospital are coming there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| that's going to happen at least until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| if and when Mercy builds a new facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7709)|
| 2:08:32| which if it happens is going to be several years out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| so they've got a growing patient demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7715)|
| 2:08:38| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7718)|
| 2:08:41| understood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7721)|
| 2:08:44| those may not all be the cream of the crop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| they may not all be people who have the best health insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7727)|
| 2:08:50| they may be Medicare and Medicaid folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| and a hospital can't survive just on those folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7733)|
| 2:08:56| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7736)|
| 2:08:59| to delay, to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| for a reasonable period of time in order to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| this work to be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7745)|
| 2:09:08| and to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| that the neighborhood's needs and desires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7751)|
| 2:09:14| have been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7754)|
| 2:09:17| that doesn't mean they get everything they've asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7757)|
| 2:09:20| but that they've been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7760)|
| 2:09:23| that has not happened here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7763)|
| 2:09:26| the only way to get there is to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7766)|
| 2:09:29| so I'm going to make a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| excuse me, I'm going to make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7772)|
| 2:09:35| not a long postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7775)|
| 2:09:38| we may need a long postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7778)|
| 2:09:41| but we can't figure out tonight even what that long postponement should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| so I'm going to make a motion to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7784)|
| 2:09:47| just so we can get everybody at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| and say okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| what would a long postponement look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| what's the time frame on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| on this work that Ms. Wallace is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7799)|
| 2:10:02| what's it all going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| we don't have that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7805)|
| 2:10:08| can we figure it out in two weeks, I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7808)|
| 2:10:11| but this council has consistently said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| often in critical situations we don't like long postponements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| but postponements for short periods of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| allow us to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7820)|
| 2:10:23| what should we do next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7823)|
| 2:10:26| should we have a longer postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7826)|
| 2:10:30| we diligently have found in that four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7830)|
| 2:10:33| that it doesn't make any sense to postpone anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7833)|
| 2:10:40| so I have a motion on the floor to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| motion on the floor to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7846)|

| 2:11:43| there was more than one no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=7903)|

| 2:16:16| Knoxville 37921| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8176)|
| 2:16:19| to hear about two specific locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8179)|
| 2:16:22| there were two stop work orders placed on Lamar Advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| in 2006, it was stop work order number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8185)|
| 2:16:28| 19522 which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8188)|
| 2:16:31| 406B North Peters Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| and stop work order number 19524| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8194)|
| 2:16:37| which was 6739 Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| I-40, I-75 at Paper Mill, both of these billboard locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8200)|
| 2:16:43| are visible from I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8203)|
| 2:16:46| I don't know if all council members were here in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8206)|
| 2:16:49| it's been a long process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8209)|
| 2:16:52| we've gone through a lot of MPC, BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8212)|
| 2:16:55| City Council, there's been workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8215)|
| 2:16:58| the Mayor put together a study committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8218)|
| 2:17:01| but I'm not here to go over any of those things that we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| for the last two years, I'm here for these two stop work orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8224)|
| 2:17:07| treat it like it was 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8227)|
| 2:17:10| and I'm going through the appeal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8230)|
| 2:17:13| of these two sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| there are a couple of issues that I just wanted to bring up that I think got lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8236)|
| 2:17:19| over these last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8239)|
| 2:17:22| one of them is when Lamar was erecting these two digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| and the stop work orders were placed on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| the Knoxville zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| article 5, section 10, subsections E, 5E| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8251)|
| 2:17:34| section 10, subsections A, 3 and 4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8254)|
| 2:17:37| and section 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| subsections E, 5, E and 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| did not apply to outdoor advertising billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| so therefore when Lamar was going through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| we did not feel that the EMC rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8269)|
| 2:17:52| targeted outdoor billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8272)|
| 2:17:55| fact number two, we all know in 2001| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8275)|
| 2:17:58| the City Council of Knoxville banned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8278)|
| 2:18:01| permits for new billboard locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8281)|
| 2:18:04| these two sites that go to these two stop work orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8284)|
| 2:18:07| they were existing billboards, they were built in the 80s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| they've been around for 20 plus years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8290)|
| 2:18:13| they were existing. When that ban was put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8293)|
| 2:18:16| it made these two billboard sites pre-existing non-conforming sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8296)|
| 2:18:19| there's a state statute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| TCA 13-7-208 that has been brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8302)|
| 2:18:25| during this ordeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8305)|
| 2:18:28| that allows a business like Lamar to take its pre-existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8308)|
| 2:18:31| non-conforming use and expand that use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| when Lamar was putting up these digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8314)|
| 2:18:37| we were just trying to expand the use of our business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| just like anyone else would with their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8320)|
| 2:18:43| so I'm here tonight again not to go over what we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8323)|
| 2:18:46| the last two years and all these meetings and committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| but to ask for City Council to grant Lamar advertising permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8329)|
| 2:18:52| to install digital billboards on these two sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8332)|
| 2:18:55| Thank you. Council Member Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8335)|
| 2:18:58| Thank you. Are these the two locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8338)|
| 2:19:01| where the stop work orders were issued because Lamar was doing work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8341)|
| 2:19:04| without a permit? Is that the same locations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8344)|
| 2:19:07| We didn't think we needed permits through the codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8347)|
| 2:19:10| but we had electrical permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8350)|
| 2:19:13| and it's digital billboards, you've got electricity, they're existing signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8353)|
| 2:19:16| We're changing out the faces, we change out the faces on billboards every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8356)|
| 2:19:19| But you were upgrading the electrical current, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| I'm not an electrician so I don't know how to answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8362)|
| 2:19:25| Okay, now your remarks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8365)|
| 2:19:28| Are these the remarks that you prepared for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8368)|
| 2:19:31| Yes, sir. You researched state law and city zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8371)|
| 2:19:34| Yeah, I've been working at Lamar for 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| Thank you, sir. Council Member Pelo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8377)|
| 2:19:40| Well, I may wait. I want to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8380)|
| 2:19:43| Ms. Cash if she will address this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| but perhaps we want to hear the other speaker first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| I will let you advise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8389)|
| 2:19:52| Duane Greaves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8392)|
| 2:19:56| Time is 9.35| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8396)|
| 2:19:59| You have up to 5 minutes. Give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8399)|
| 2:20:02| Thank you for being here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor. Council, Duane Greaves, number 8 Emory Place, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8405)|
| 2:20:08| And I'm here on behalf of Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8408)|
| 2:20:11| I am the president of Scenic Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8411)|
| 2:20:14| Basically, I'm going to be very short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| You know our stance. We've been before you on a number of other occasions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| dealing with digital billboards and now the EMCs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8420)|
| 2:20:23| And basically what Scenic Knoxville says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8423)|
| 2:20:26| and fully supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| is what the administration has to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| about EMCs and digital billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| and also we support the BZA's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8435)|
| 2:20:38| on denial of this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8438)|
| 2:20:41| Thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8441)|
| 2:20:44| Thank you, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| Do you want to pose your question for Ms. Cash at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| That would be fun. If Ms. Cash will speak to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| I think that could be helpful to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| Certainly. My name is Anita Cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| I'm the zoning coordinator with the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| And unfortunately, we cannot overlook everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8463)|
| 2:21:06| that's happened between 2006 and today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8466)|
| 2:21:09| I won't bore you with all of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| but I will give you some of the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8472)|
| 2:21:15| Our office received a complaint that there were some billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8475)|
| 2:21:18| that were being converted to electronic message center capabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8478)|
| 2:21:21| We did issue stop orders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| We then proceeded with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8484)|
| 2:21:27| Law Director Poplin's guidance to obtain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| temporary restraining orders against Lamar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8490)|
| 2:21:33| for these two locations inside the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8493)|
| 2:21:36| We did have a mayor's advisory committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8496)|
| 2:21:39| We've had a request before the board of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| that was applied for by Lamar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| to appeal my interpretation that those billboards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| meet the definition of an electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| That application was made on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8511)|
| 2:21:54| September 18, 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8514)|
| 2:21:57| And then we received a request to table that item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| It was tabled until we received a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8520)|
| 2:22:03| in July of 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8523)|
| 2:22:06| to put it back on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8526)|
| 2:22:09| It was placed back on the BZA agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8529)|
| 2:22:12| They voted in August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| to put it back on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8535)|
| 2:22:18| It was heard by the board of zoning appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8538)|
| 2:22:21| and they upheld the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8541)|
| 2:22:24| that those billboards did in fact meet the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8544)|
| 2:22:27| of an electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8547)|
| 2:22:30| So that gets us to where we are tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8550)|
| 2:22:33| and I want to give you the city's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8553)|
| 2:22:36| that we still believe that those billboards did meet the definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| of an electronic message center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| The zoning ordinance defines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| an electronic message center as a sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| which uses a bank of lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| that can be individually lit to form copy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8571)|
| 2:22:54| such as words, letters, logos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8574)|
| 2:22:57| figures, symbols, illustrations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8577)|
| 2:23:00| or patterns to form a message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| without altering the sign face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| In this packet you received some pictures of some signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8586)|
| 2:23:09| and I want you to call your attention to this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8589)|
| 2:23:12| first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8592)|
| 2:23:15| And I'm sorry yours aren't in color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| but if you look at this bottom picture right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8598)|
| 2:23:21| you can see that there are rows of lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| that can be programmed to light up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8604)|
| 2:23:27| If you look at the next picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080923?start=8607)|
