| 0:02:55| talking about the really horrific acts in Newtown, Connecticut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| Certainly we have all been gripped by those events that took place, and as we celebrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| Christmas, celebrate this holiday season, I know we'll all be thinking about our fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| citizens up in Newtown and what they're going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| So our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and to the community of Newtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| I want to remind everybody that the city offices will be open on Monday, which is Christmas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=201)|
| 0:03:28| Eve, but we will be closed on Tuesday and will be open again on Wednesday, December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| We also want to remind everybody that our police department has traffic enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| plans for the Christmas and New Year's holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=219)|
| 0:03:44| The Christmas enforcement period will begin at 4 p.m. on Monday and conclude at midnight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| on Tuesday, Christmas Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Of course, we enforce all the time, but this is extra enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| And New Year's enforcement campaign will begin at 4 p.m. on New Year's Eve and conclude at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| midnight on New Year's Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| So we appreciate Chief Roush and all of his officers for making sure that they keep us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=241)|
| 0:04:07| safe this holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| Also I want to just tell you that Monday was the one-year anniversary since I was sworn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=250)|
| 0:04:15| into office, and several of my fellow council people, four of us were sworn, four of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=255)|
| 0:04:21| all plus me, were sworn in on December 17th last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| I just want to thank council for a great year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| It certainly has gone by quickly, and I appreciate the cooperation and the collaboration that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| we've had and a lot of tough issues that we tackled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| We did send out or posted on our Facebook and website and Twitter a summary of kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=277)|
| 0:04:46| of the main issues that we dealt with, and then by each department, I asked departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=286)|
| 0:04:52| to talk about what they accomplished in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| So please look at the website or the Facebook post, and there's a summary, kind of the highlights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| for each department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| Certainly a lot more was done than we could even fit on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| But I thank council, I thank my leadership team, I thank all of our city employees, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=305)|
| 0:05:12| all the people in the community, the non-profit partners, the business community, all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| folks that have worked with us this past year to make this a really good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| And that is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| I just want to wish everybody a very happy holiday and a happy new year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| So council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=332)|
| 0:05:33| Thank you, Mayor O'Hara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| I just wanted to announce again that I'll be ringing the bell for the Salvation Army this Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| with the program on Chapman Highway from 10 to 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| And like last time, don't bring any jingling money, bring folding money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| And I'll also have my quarterly coffee with the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| That's the 29th of this month from 9 to 11 at the world-famous Roundup Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| Everybody's welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I just want to wish everybody a Merry Christmas, all the people in the city of Knoxville and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=364)|
| 0:06:09| the 6th District and my colleagues on council, and to you and your staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=369)|
| 0:06:15| And I think you've done a wonderful job in this year as mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=380)|
| 0:06:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I had big shoes to fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=386)|
| 0:06:27| I will echo that it's been a fast year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=387)|
| 0:06:30| We've had a couple of issues that were in-depth, and that's all I'll say about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| But what I do want to say is that TDOT paved 10 miles of Middlebrook Pike from Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| to Western Avenue, and that will really help Santa make his rounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| It also means that that's in case there's not enough snow for the sleigh and he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| to use the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=411)|
| 0:06:53| But I do know I've received a lot of comments from folks in the district who run up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=413)|
| 0:06:57| down Middlebrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| They certainly called when it was a washboard-type event, and they're also calling and writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| notes about the fact that it's improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| So there is good news there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| We just have a couple pieces to finish up, and that will come soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=431)|
| 0:07:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| I just wanted everyone to know that TDOT did do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| TDOT did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| Any other reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=438)|
| 0:07:19| Yeah, I would just, I'd like to not only echo what Nan had to say, but also just mention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=439)|
| 0:07:24| about TDOT also, that they went ahead and tore the gas station down there in Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| They have sodded it, and we are working with them to possibly have that turned into a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=450)|
| 0:07:35| city plaza area for the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| But TDOT has been very cooperative, and maybe, Brenda, it is because it's Christmas time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=462)|
| 0:07:43| But I did want to report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| But thank you, and Merry Christmas, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=466)|
| 0:07:48| Any other council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=468)|
| 0:07:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=470)|

| 0:07:58| A resolution approving an appeal by Westmoreland Hills Homeowners Association and individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| homeowners of MPC's approval of a use-on-review for a 1,500-square-foot accessory building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| proposed at 1013 Bridgestone Place, subject to six conditions, MPC-approved, 12-3, second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Okay, would you like to be called on, Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=496)|
| 0:08:27| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| I'd like to, this is an issue that I've been dealing with for the last couple weeks pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| extensively, but I think before we hear the speakers and before we get involved in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=513)|
| 0:08:38| I'd like for our City Council attorney to discuss and give us the ground rules for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| particular appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| I have reviewed the material for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| Some of the material contains emails that indicate people in the neighborhood are of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| the opinion that the proposed building does not comply with the neighborhood's deed restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| and cite that as a basis to turn down the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=539)|
| 0:09:05| However, I must advise City Council that City Council does not enforce deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| Deed restriction disputes are between the neighborhood and the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=552)|
| 0:09:16| Deed restrictions are an extra set of rules above and beyond what is required by law or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=562)|
| 0:09:23| Therefore, in making a decision tonight, Council should not consider deed restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| Tonight's appeal deals with the use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=569)|
| 0:09:33| This is different from a typical rezoning dispute where Council has more leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=573)|
| 0:09:38| Council is hearing the appeal in a de novo basis, in an administrative capacity and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| in a legislative capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=584)|
| 0:09:46| In other terms, you're acting more like a judge, less like a member of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| The standards for uses on review are found in Article 5, Section 3, and I'll abbreviate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=591)|
| 0:10:00| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=600)|
| 0:10:01| The things that need to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| The use is consistent with adopted plans or policies, including the general plan and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=603)|
| 0:10:08| one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| The use is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of these zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| The use is compatible with the character of the neighborhood where it is proposed and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| with the size and location of the buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| The use will not significantly injure the value of adjacent property or by noise, lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| fumes, odors, vibration, traffic, congestion, or other impacts that detract from the immediate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| The use is not of a nature or so located as to draw substantial additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| through residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| And finally, the nature of the development in the surrounding area is not such as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| pose a potential hazard to the proposed use or to create an undesirable environment for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=647)|
| 0:10:54| the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| So when folks, as they reviewed the record tonight and I'm sure they're going to be hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=655)|
| 0:11:00| from speakers tonight, need to be taking into account those standards in making their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=660)|
| 0:11:05| determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=668)|
| 0:11:09| Okay, I'll explain the procedure now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| First, the appellants, that's the people who have filed the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| They will have up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Each speaker may speak up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| And I believe we have two people that have signed up, actually, so you get five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=683)|
| 0:11:28| each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| And after they're finished, then the respondent has five minutes each, up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=689)|
| 0:11:38| And then the appellants, then they have the opportunity for a rebuttal for up to two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=698)|
| 0:11:47| So that's the procedure that we will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=707)|
| 0:11:50| So we'll first, for those who are the appellants, we have two names, we have George Prosser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| and Jennifer Goswitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| Sir, please state your name and address for the record and I'll start the timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| Your Honor and members of counsel, my name is George Prosser and my address is 7316 Parliament| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=731)|
| 0:12:13| And if I may, I would like to pass around some photographs, starting on each end, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=738)|
| 0:12:19| Bob or somebody, can you help him for the sake of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=739)|
| 0:12:25| And Mr. Prosser, your comments are well taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=745)|
| 0:12:28| And some of the e-mails that you saw probably result from the general citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=748)|
| 0:12:38| This is a complex process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| We do understand that the only thing we are here to appeal tonight is the MPC decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=760)|
| 0:12:49| The MPC decision, the use-owner review, which approved a 1,500-square-foot auxiliary building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=769)|
| 0:12:59| as opposed to the 1,100-square-foot that the property owner would be entitled to anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=779)|
| 0:13:08| So if there has been some reference to deed restrictions, we know that they're not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=788)|
| 0:13:15| play here and it's not intended that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| But we do think that many of those items that you read off do pertain here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=798)|
| 0:13:26| Harmony, aesthetics, significant property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| And the next speaker will be saying quite a bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| There is another issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| That building will be built near a drainage area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| That drainage area, we have fought a battle with that drainage area for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| We're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| We're trying to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| We've had some assistance from council and from city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| We believe that an additional 1,500-square-foot roof and other impermeable materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=834)|
| 0:14:05| such as we think approximately 4,000-square-foot concrete driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| will adversely impact our drainage situation back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| And those pictures we're sending around, we're just showing you what we have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| So we are here to ask council to support the appeal and to vote for the resolution to overturn MPC's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=862)|
| 0:14:35| Now, I am a myself and Nancy and Lynn and Jeff DeRohan are probably the most impacted property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=875)|
| 0:14:46| We are going to be looking at a structure from in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=886)|
| 0:14:53| It will be across obviously on the other people's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| but a structure that I believe I can safely say will be at least 30 feet high from my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| From the property owner's view, it will only be 15 feet high and also screened by trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=903)|
| 0:15:11| And I talked to Plans and Reviews today and they said, hey, it doesn't matter how tall it is in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=911)|
| 0:15:18| The only thing that matters is how tall it is in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| And I explained to that rep, he said it could be 150 feet in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=922)|
| 0:15:27| And that's --it has to do with the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=927)|
| 0:15:31| And I explained to him, the back is the only thing that matters to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| That's what I'm going to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| That's what Nancy is going to be looking at every day, Lynn and Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| So we want you to consider that, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=941)|
| 0:15:46| And we are asking here that we go back to an 1,100-square-foot footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=946)|
| 0:15:52| which will be less onerous than a 1,500-square-foot footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| And if I may, I would just like to ask some of the representatives from the neighborhood to stand, if they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=959)|
| 0:16:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| We surveyed 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| We were able to get in touch with 37 property owners within 200 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=976)|
| 0:16:22| Of those 37 property owners, we found no property owners who were in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=982)|
| 0:16:27| So if I may, I would like to, at this time, hand off to Ms. Goswitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=987)|
| 0:16:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Mayor, excuse me just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Yes, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Mr. Prosser is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Would you explain your photos to make sure that Council understands where those photos are taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| The photos that show the running water were taken from 7320 Parliament Drive, the property of Jeff and Lynn DeRowan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1004)|
| 0:16:54| And that's just to show you the runoff that occurs there every time we get a big rain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1014)|
| 0:17:01| The photos that show my feeble efforts at stabilizing that bank are to demonstrate to you that I've spent a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1021)|
| 0:17:12| and Nancy spent a lot of time stacking those rocks, trying to get them right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| You'll see we've tried to drive them in the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And when it rains hard, the rocks go downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| So it's a drainage issue that we feel will be severely impacted by this construction because of the additional impermeable surfaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1044)|
| 0:17:39| All of those photos are about drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1066)|
| 0:17:47| Ma'am, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Jennifer Goswitz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| I live at 7304 Misty Meadow Place in Westmoreland Hills Subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| Thank you all for listening to us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1077)|
| 0:17:58| I'm wearing two hats here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| One, I am a homeowner and have been there for about 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| The second hat I'm wearing is I'm a realtor and have been licensed as a broker since 1985 in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| I work for Remax Realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| I'm fully aware of the carriage house, garage apartment, whatever, guest house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| whatever the different name that the channels have gone through on this house that's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| I do know Carol Phillips not well, just someone I've seen in passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| She seems like a very lovely person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| None of us are here today because this is personal at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| But she lives in a beautiful home of high quality and nobody here is complaining about her home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| It's a lovely home, one of the prettiest homes on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1123)|
| 0:18:45| That's not why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| Our neighborhood has been such that it is a nicer in neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1127)|
| 0:18:53| The people there have pride in their ownership there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| They feel like we live in a nice area and they don't want to see basically two houses on one lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| There is a house toward the end of the cul-de-sac that's a very large house on about three lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| that would maybe lend itself to something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| This property is more of a property that any of you that look at a lot of lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| sometimes we say a lot that goes more straight down this way, kind of a shotgun, versus a rectangular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1160)|
| 0:19:27| If their lot were more rectangular, it might make sense for them to build something on the side of their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Theirs is more of a shotgun and so they want to build basically a second home behind their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| As far as the effects of all the homeowners, as far as I'm concerned as a realtor and as a homeowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1178)|
| 0:19:47| I cannot see this where I am from, so that's not why I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| But I'm here to explain to you that all of the people on Parliament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| there's a lot of people on Parliament, and the ones on Bridgestone, even on that side of their building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1196)|
| 0:20:02| they're going to look outside and see basically a beautiful home and then a whole other home behind that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| There's really nothing else there or really in any other subdivision of Westmoreland Hills that has something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1209)|
| 0:20:18| Especially the Prosser's and several other people, they're going to walk out into their backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| and it's going to look like there's a house, then another house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| My experience as a real estate agent, when I go and show properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| you might have somebody from out of town and you're showing them 10, 12, 15 homes in one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1231)|
| 0:20:37| You take them in, they go in, they love the front, they love the inside of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| you take them out to the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| If you take them out the back side of that property and there is a big guest house or garage house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1243)|
| 0:20:50| or whatever you want to call it, I don't care what you call it, it's a big tall structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| And then there's another house in front of it and nobody else has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| They're not going to buy that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1260)|
| 0:21:03| They're going to look at me and say, let's go, I'm eliminating this house from my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| So while it may not affect my house personally at that moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| every time a house goes for sale on Parliament or on Bridgestone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| and you walk that person in there and they see the house, they love it, they want to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| they go outside and go, no, wait, I'm not looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| I'm not looking at that when I come out in my backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1286)|
| 0:21:30| They can't sell their home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Not only can they not sell it if they could get somebody to buy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| the value of their property has gone down drastically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| Now, if that happens to the Prosser's and the next family and the next family and the next family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| what happens is it's a ripple effect for that whole neighborhood, whether you see it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| This lot was never intended to have two households form one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| And that's what's actually going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1315)|
| 0:21:58| This is, again, nothing personal against these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| If they need that kind of space, maybe this isn't the right place for them to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| But if you all go along with this, you are going to devalue everybody's home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1326)|
| 0:22:12| including mine, if you allow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| This is not in keeping with the subdivision, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Now, against the appeal to speak is Benjamin Moorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1343)|
| 0:22:33| Please state your name and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Benny Moorman, president of Benchmark Associates, 10308 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| We provided a letter and a copy of the plans to each of the council members for their review by e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| I would ask that those items be made a part of public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| I would also like to make you aware that due to our plans and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| we have already obtained a building permit to construct the plans as approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| Those plans are for an 1,100-square-foot footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1386)|
| 0:23:13| Our intentions, because of our plans to merge two families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| is that we start construction in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1396)|
| 0:23:24| The thing about the plans is they are for an 1,100-square-foot structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| It is a detached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| And it was designed in a manner that when we get to putting everything together and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1411)|
| 0:23:40| if we need the additional 400-square-foot that we were afforded through MPC's use on review and approval and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1420)|
| 0:23:49| we would be able to continue on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| We went through a great a lot, a large amount of effort, cost, time in meeting that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1431)|
| 0:23:58| And we would really like to not be faced with retracing those footprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| I mentioned, as far as property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I would call your attention to the fact that that has been presented to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And as a result, I have contacted numerous realtors and appraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| I was assured by each and every one that as long as the improvements are done tastefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1457)|
| 0:24:24| they would not be detrimental to property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| I do not want to harm my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| In fact, they mentioned that if it's done tastefully, it could add to the property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Is it going to change the character as the adjoining neighbors have right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| I'm not denying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| They've been afforded the look of a larger rear yard than they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1480)|
| 0:24:47| But the fact is, this is this property owner's rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| And she should be entitled to utilize her property as long as it falls within the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1491)|
| 0:24:58| And it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| As far as the drainage and the pictures you've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| we're not arguing the fact that there is a volume of water that runs through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| and that the methods that have been utilized to try to combat that or whatever has not been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| We're not arguing that fact at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| There is a 50-foot drainage easement 25 feet over into Ms. Phillips' rear yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| and 25 feet over into the adjoining rear yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| I've been involved with the property for four years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| and I've not seen it get outside that 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| And our planned improvements are not inside that 50 feet area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| I did hire an engineer to look at our plans even when it was a 1,500-square-foot structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| And his findings was that that drainage way is draining a 95-acre basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1553)|
| 0:26:02| And that is the result of what's causing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1562)|
| 0:26:05| Our improvements would be minimal to no effect in his professional opinion on that drainage way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| Any drainage that would come off our improvements would already be gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| before the multitude of that water even gets there from the other 95 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1576)|
| 0:26:26| And I feel at this time that you need to know that I'm glad to see I'm speaking highly of Ms. Phillips today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1586)|
| 0:26:35| because up until today there has been numerous misleading statements and correspondence to MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1595)|
| 0:26:41| that contain slanderous statements about Ms. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1601)|
| 0:26:46| They discriminated against her in their correspondence within the HOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1606)|
| 0:26:52| She has not been privy to their actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| She's not been copied on e-mails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| She has been excluded in every way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1616)|
| 0:27:01| Given an opportunity to relocate, we would gladly remove ourselves from this environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1621)|
| 0:27:08| It's really been hard on Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1628)|
| 0:27:10| She's struggled with the aggressiveness of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Sir, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1635)|
| 0:27:17| In closing, I wish to apologize to you all for having to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1637)|
| 0:27:21| I'm sympathetic with your desires to serve the community and the time that you give in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| I wish you could spend your time on more deserving issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| However, I would welcome your support in denying the appeal as presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Should the circumstances arise that we need the additional storage area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| it would be a great relief to know that we have avoided having to encounter this process again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| when we've already met those facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Now the appellants have up to two minutes for rebuttal if you should choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1667)|
| 0:27:53| I would like to say, and I was remiss not saying it before, Carol Phillips has been a wonderful neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1673)|
| 0:27:58| She's an icon in Rocky Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| This is not personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Carol Phillips has been a wonderful neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| Carol Phillips doesn't show up at these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1683)|
| 0:28:05| Maybe she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| I haven't seen her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Mr. Moorman is her spokesman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1689)|
| 0:28:10| So, and I don't know of any slanderous comments about Ms. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| That would be totally out of bounds, and she's a wonderful person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| I'm sure Mr. Moorman is a good person as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| This is the only opportunity and the only place we have to overturn this MPC decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1702)|
| 0:28:32| If we don't get it overturned here, it's going to live forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| So we do ask your support to overturn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| With regard to Mr. Moorman's hydrologist, his expert, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| it strains the credibility to think that another 5,500 square feet of impermeable material will not add to the drainage problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1727)|
| 0:28:56| And I'm certainly not a hydrologist myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| I would not be able to document that other than it does strain the credibility there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1740)|
| 0:29:09| So we ask for your support for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1749)|
| 0:29:16| Oh, and one other thing, if I've got a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Mr. Moorman's experts say it will not impact my property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| Our expert says it will impact the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| The one thing I know for sure is if our expert is right, I've got nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1771)|
| 0:29:37| I can't come back to you folks when I get ready to sell that home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| Lynn and Jeff can't do that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| Please bear that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| And thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| First of all, I want to say that in the last week or ten days that I've had the opportunity to talk to not only the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| and the Neighborhood Association, but also to Mr. Moorman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| And I want to say that both groups have been very cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| And there has been no slanderous remarks made to me one way or the other about either one of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1810)|
| 0:30:17| What we have, though, is really an unfortunate situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| Any time we on council have to get involved with neighborhoods that have a dispute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| And it has been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| You've heard what one side has to say about the value of their homes and what one side has to say about drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| And all of us know we can get experts that can go either way on what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| But a couple of things that I would like to say that in looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| and in reviewing what MPC did and what our standards are that Mr. Frost went over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1847)|
| 0:30:55| is that in my opinion and in going out onto the site and talking with the different folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| and talking with the folks that are going to be impacted by this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| and in your package you've got the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| You should have received the plans that Mr. Moorman has a building permit for, 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Once again, one of the things that I think we need to keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1876)|
| 0:31:20| whether we're talking 1,500 or 1,100, is that you almost double that in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| We're talking a two-story structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| We're also talking about a structure that in the adjacent homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1888)|
| 0:31:32| right around the immediate area that we're talking about looking at where this structure will go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1892)|
| 0:31:38| there are no outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| The houses are rather close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| I hope that some of you have had the opportunity to drive out and look at the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| and see how the neighborhood has developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| I want to say that from that standpoint that I think that one of the things that I've looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1909)|
| 0:31:58| is that whether or not the building that is being done, and by the way, it is an attractive building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| It is a building that's going to have the garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| It has three garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| It has an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| It has open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| It also has a bathroom up on the second floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| As I said, it is an attractive building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| But I'm concerned about it in terms of the size and being incompatible with the neighborhood in those particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| especially those two streets where the houses are located close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1947)|
| 0:32:31| It's also and I understand what Mr. Moorman is saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| and I understand what the neighbors are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| It is their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| And those folks have had the privilege of being able to look at this property for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| And we do know that there will be an 1,100-square-foot structure that goes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| 1,100 square feet plus another 1,000, a 2,100-square-foot structure down in the center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| down away from the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| I feel personally that it is incompatible with the existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| I think the size and location of accessory buildings in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| if you look at them, you'll find that most of the pool houses are much smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| You'll find that even the house at the end of the road that has three structures is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| as the lady from the real estate agency said, sits on three different lots at the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=1996)|
| 0:33:22| Much bigger house, much more space, and a lot more space between the houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2002)|
| 0:33:26| which really makes a difference in terms of where this is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2006)|
| 0:33:31| The other thing that I want to address, and just to let council know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| the drainage problem, I had been out, I guess I was on council, maybe it wasn't even six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2015)|
| 0:33:40| and I got a telephone call from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| And I had been up and down that creek several times with some of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2022)|
| 0:33:46| And I think the pictures that you see of the stones in the creek, a couple times I've been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| it was almost as though there were no stones left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| And we went from not only the adjacent property where Mr. Mormon is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| but we went all the way up to the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| And there is a problem there, and it's a problem that probably the city needs to address at some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| in terms of the drainage through there, because it does overflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| The rocks are moving down the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| They go down and bring them back, put them back up on the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| and eventually, hopefully, this will be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| But, again, I think that it is hard for me to comprehend that if you're going to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| four or five thousand square feet of hard surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| that there wouldn't be some drainage or additional drainage problem there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| So I think that's one of the things that we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| I think also that, and I'll go back to the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| which is one of the things that we look at when we talk about use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| I think that, again, a structure this far away from the existing house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| and as large as it is, I think that is a potential problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| It is good to know that, as far as any kind of compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| that the neighborhood realizes that Mr. Moorman can go ahead and build an 1,100 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| which he has gotten his building permit for and is ready to go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| So I really feel that, in some ways, there are some compromise here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2109)|
| 0:35:14| in terms of being allowed to do what you are allowed to do in terms of with 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| So, again, kind of to summarize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2120)|
| 0:35:23| I really feel that what is being proposed is really not in harmony with the general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| of what the intent of the zoning regulations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| I think that that's one of the things that we need to look at very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| Will it injure the value of the homes around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| I think, as Mr. Prosser says, probably none of us really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| I'm sure that we can get people to appraise one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| I'm sure Mr. Wallace can address that situation where you have different realtors go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| and they look at different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| I do know that the homes in that area are well cared for, well kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| And I would be concerned also, if I were there, in terms of having, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| another structure, another house in the center of an area which is surrounded by homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| So with that and with those reasons that I've mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| I'm really going to move that we approve the appeal that's been put before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| I'm a little confused, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson a question or two since the MPC wrestled with the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| As I look at these regulations in Section 4 of the Mr. Prosser talked about Section 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2197)|
| 0:36:44| but Section 4 deals with accessory use buildings and structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Do I understand correctly that it is a permitted use to build something 1,100 square feet or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| but once you go over that, you get a use on review for up to 1,500 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| In other words, there are different tiers of structures that one can have as an accessory building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| Mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| Yes, you've characterized that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| The code allows for accessory buildings on lots greater than one acre up to 1,100 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2234)|
| 0:37:23| as a use by right and then up to 1,500 square feet as a use permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2243)|
| 0:37:31| So anything between 1,100 feet and 1,500 feet would require going through the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2251)|
| 0:37:39| Any accessory structure greater than 1,500 square feet is not permitted at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| And following on that same line, it's a little confusing after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| but it looked like this thing started as a carriage house with residential use and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2270)|
| 0:37:57| and that got changed and withdrawn because you cannot have two residential structures on an R1 lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| Is that how we got here to this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| The application that the Planning Commission had before it was merely for an accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| containing a garage, an office, and storage space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| There was never any mention in the application of an additional dwelling unit or an additional house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2297)|
| 0:38:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Well, that's in our packet, and maybe that's how it started with the neighborhood issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| because I noticed letters talking about 4,000 square feet and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| Tell me on the 1,100 square feet, Mr. Greave mentioned, I guess there's a distinction between how big is the footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2315)|
| 0:38:46| and when do you have two stories and, therefore, more internal usable square footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| Would you tell me how that works in regard to Section 4 and accessory uses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2332)|
| 0:38:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| The code speaks to 1,500 square feet of building coverage, not floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2338)|
| 0:39:07| So it would be the footprint that is the determinant of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| The size of the footprint and not how much usable space is inside the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2356)|
| 0:39:17| And then you have a height restriction, but it meets that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Did they have to come to you at all if they wanted to build an 1,100 square foot or less structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2361)|
| 0:39:27| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| That is a use by right and simply pulling a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| So that kicks it over to the engineering side of the world about are you building a proper type building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| with the right features to protect public safety and whatnot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| That application would be to permits and inspections, and then it would be tested against the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2389)|
| 0:39:50| If we look at the fact that this might be 1,100 square feet or someday 1,500,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2390)|
| 0:39:55| if the use on review is present because he could expand it somehow, the footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2395)|
| 0:40:03| did that bring the MPC at all into the situation where we're looking at that one criteria that Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2403)|
| 0:40:13| Frost read, which had to do with the amount of whether there was damage to the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2413)|
| 0:40:21| or to the community somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Let me see if I can find that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| It was in section three, and it was item number six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| The nature of the development in the surrounding area is not such as to pose a potential hazard to the proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2428)|
| 0:40:34| or create an undesirable environment for the proposed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| I'm talking about that criteria in section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| It's A6, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| Did you look at this environmental runoff question in the MPC since you were dealing with a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2442)|
| 0:40:49| under a use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Did you have to tackle, are you going to have too much runoff or accelerated runoff because you have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| what do they say, 4,000 square foot driveway that's going to be a water chute or something into this system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2455)|
| 0:41:02| We did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2462)|
| 0:41:04| The total proposed impervious surface did not trigger the threshold for even getting a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| for a stormwater protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| There's some number for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Usually it's one acre of disturbed surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| And the applicant did provide the letter from the engineer showing that this was at the bottom of a 95 acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2484)|
| 0:41:34| drainage basin and that the stormwater from this particular lot would be well on its way downstream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2494)|
| 0:41:40| before the stormwater from the basin above would get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| I'm not sure I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| You're saying it doesn't accelerate the flow somehow because it's at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| There's a timing issue involved in stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| The nature of this particular drainage basin is such that stormwater from this lot would be well away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2515)|
| 0:42:03| from the area by the time that the bulk of the stormwater from the drainage basin above would be at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| If I could ask you one more question, that is, what if this were somehow converted to a residential use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| Would that be in violation of the zoning use on review that we have or the zoning code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| That would be a violation of the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| Of the R1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| But if it's used as either storage or garage parking, it would fit the R1 zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2547)|
| 0:42:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Councilman Wallace's life has been on too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| Would you like for him to go next?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2563)|
| 0:42:45| Okay, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| I'd like to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Who wants to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Now, this is a tough issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| And given that I live nearby in the Westmoreland area, given that I've been a realtor for almost 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2575)|
| 0:43:04| and understand architecture of homes and additions, I've taken quite a bit of look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2584)|
| 0:43:11| This lot is larger than the other lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| It's an acre lot as opposed to many of the other lots it backs up to up on Parliament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| And that puts it in a different category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| That being an acre, their use by right is 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| And they have the right to ask for 1,500 square feet for a footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2606)|
| 0:43:31| Outbuildings are typical in Westmoreland Hills, Unit 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| There's several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2616)|
| 0:43:37| There's obviously multiple units in Westmoreland Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| We're talking about Unit 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| There are multiple properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2621)|
| 0:43:44| Probably over 10% of the properties have outbuildings of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Most of those are, like you said, like Councilman Greaves said, there tend to be pool houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| But a lot of them are on smaller lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2635)|
| 0:43:58| Many homes have multiple garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2638)|
| 0:44:00| That's probably not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2640)|
| 0:44:02| Some of them are detached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| But most of them are attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| And then many homes have additional driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Many homes have additional parking area and non-pervious areas in their yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| which would make it – it's tough to say whether it's compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| I think it's very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Significantly injure the value of adjacent property until the fear of the unknown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2665)|
| 0:44:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| Until it's built, until it's seen, until it's known, the fear of that is definitely questionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| And it would initially until it's probably built and it's known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| I don't think that, as in Article 5, it points out the useful –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| you know, it won't injure the value of the adjacent property by noise or lights or fumes or odors or vibration, traffic, congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2687)|
| 0:44:56| It will build by appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| And appearance is not one of those that's listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| It's the size of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| It's a typical –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| I guess in the back it'd be simply a two-story house with a roof on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| That would be about 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| It's closer to their lot line than it is to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| And that does make it significantly different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| But it's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| It's a very subjective call on a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| My one question to Mark is, does a use on review ever expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| He's not planning on using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| He's got a building permit for 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| If he doesn't build it, does that use on review ever expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2736)|
| 0:45:43| Generally, the use on review runs with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| We have on occasion put some time constraints into use on review approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2746)|
| 0:45:55| But in general, it goes with the land as long as that particular use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2755)|
| 0:46:02| and that particular site plan remains consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| So he wouldn't have to come back – if he approved the 1,500 square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| he wouldn't have to come back and – that would be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| He'd have to get a building permit for that and then just add on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| If he were to change any element of the plan that was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2778)|
| 0:46:24| he would have to come back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| But if he were to build it as he submitted it and keep it in that form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2787)|
| 0:46:37| it goes in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| He seems to be comfortable with 1,100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| He's willing to get a building permit for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| And I think if he's comfortable with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| I'm not sure that would warrant us giving him any more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2809)|
| 0:46:59| It's a tough call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| I think it's very, very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| It's one man's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| I could argue both sides of the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2822)|
| 0:47:07| Certainly, I think the greatest fear is the fear of the unknown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| It's not built yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2833)|
| 0:47:14| Yes, I'm going to address my question to Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| And thank you for your remarks, and I'm going to support your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| But I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| I've heard detached garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| I've heard carriage house, accessory building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| What is the proper term for the building that's being proposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| It may not even really make any difference, but I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| The zoning ordinance has a definition for accessory building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| and this meets that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| There are no living quarters in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| and so it doesn't qualify as a dwelling unit or a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| So, therefore, it would not be a carriage house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| Generally, a carriage house is thought of not only as a garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| but as a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2883)|
| 0:48:05| It sounds like everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2891)|
| 0:48:12| Well, again, I want to say, and George has some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Pull your mic down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Pull my what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| We want to hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| I think George has some good points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| and I know that he's struggled with this as much as I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| I do continue, though, to come back to the fact that it was interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| George, you made a comment that this is a two-story house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| And when you think about it, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| That's what I've struggled with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| that we have a structure that is in this particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| that is a two-story structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| and it's a very attractive structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| But it is, to me, it is incompatible with the surrounding area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| which is those two streets that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| And so when I look at what the development standards have to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| that's why I go back with both the aspect about the harmony of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2946)|
| 0:49:11| and also about the compatibility of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| I also think that there's no doubt that it is unknown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| in terms of the values and the values of the homes that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| and there is a certain fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| When you're on the property, whether you're on the Mormon property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| or whether you're on the adjacent property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| there is this issue of, as you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| a two-story house sitting down where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| A lot of the structures and a lot of the houses in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| in terms of driving around and actually walking the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| and looking at the structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2985)|
| 0:49:47| there are a number of houses that have three- and four-car garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2987)|
| 0:49:50| but they're attached to the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| And so there, again, there's a certain harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| in what is being done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| The ones that are the larger, quote, accessory buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| in some cases those are much closer to the house than what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| So this is really put further down where it almost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| when we talk about an accessory building or talk about a detached building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| if anything, this really reflects what a detached building really is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| because it is a good distance from the main house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| as opposed to the rest of the ones in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| So there, again, I agree that it's been difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3024)|
| 0:50:29| I know it's been difficult for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| It's been difficult for Mr. Moorman, the situation that he has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| But I think that by him going ahead and getting his building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| the day before yesterday for 1,100 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| that there, again, that he can proceed with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| so that we're not stopping him from the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| in order to go ahead and build an accessory building at that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| So, again, I move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Well, see, it's a two-story, no matter whether it's 1,500 or 1,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| I mean, it's still going to be, it's still the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3063)|
| 0:51:05| I mean, I think that's, you know, you've still got the same structure there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3065)|
| 0:51:08| It's still going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| It's still going to look just like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| So, I mean, that doesn't change, just the size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3077)|
| 0:51:18| I mean, I'm just making that, you know, but you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3081)|
| 0:51:22| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3082)|
| 0:51:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Councilman Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3084)|
| 0:51:25| I just want to check with Council to be sure I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| So whether we approve the appeal or deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| an 1,100-square-foot structure can be built based on the building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| under existing zoning laws, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3099)|
| 0:51:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3101)|
| 0:51:42| As you heard Mr. Donaldson say and also in your packet of what came to City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| there's a little grid that discusses the size of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| And if your lot is a certain size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3111)|
| 0:51:53| it's allowed as of right to build a certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| Section three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| And according to the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3117)|
| 0:51:58| it's allowed as of right for an 1,100-square-foot building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| And if I could, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| Mr. Moorman, would you mind coming back to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| Is there any chance that regardless of how this goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| when you're building a structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3135)|
| 0:52:17| that you could look at the driveway and use impervious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| I mean pervious material that lets water go down instead of runoff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| I mean, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| is there some way to build this better in the process of doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Interesting you'd bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| Ms. Phillips's residence today is one of the only ones that does have an impervious driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| I get confused by words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3157)|
| 0:52:38| Is pervious means water in and impervious means water over the top?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| Impervious means it runs off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| She has a pervious driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| So it soaks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3164)|
| 0:52:45| Her current driveway is brick papers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| one of the only ones in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3170)|
| 0:52:52| She's got an acre-sized lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| So currently, with her acre-sized lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3174)|
| 0:52:58| her only impervious surface is a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| If you look at the properties throughout the community in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3182)|
| 0:53:07| her impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| if you counted the existing driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| would be in the lower percentile of the residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3192)|
| 0:53:17| There are some residences out there that have over 60 percent impervious surface over the entire property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3197)|
| 0:53:25| They're having more runoff, you're saying, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| Well, I mean, they may have a smaller lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| but they're sitting there with a three-quarter acre lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| and 60 percent of it is impervious surface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| But back to my original question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| is that something you would consider doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| as you extend the driveway to reach the back building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| We might consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| I can't at this point say that it's within the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| But I would tell you that the amount of impervious surface post-construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3227)|
| 0:53:52| even if her existing driveway was impervious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3232)|
| 0:53:55| and it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| it does absorb some runoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| is below the norm out there, way below the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I've got it that was submitted to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| I don't know if I can put my fingers on it right away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| because of the volume of stuff that's went in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| I think I can, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| and I'd like to make you all aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| Her impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| and that's treating her existing driveway as being the typical concrete driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| is currently 11.21 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| Of the total area of the lot, is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| 11.21 percent of her lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3276)|
| 0:54:38| So she's got an acre-sized lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| just over a tenth of an acre is impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| which is not really true because she does have brick pavers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| Post-construction, her impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| if you included the existing driveway as impervious surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3291)|
| 0:54:54| 14.64 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3294)|
| 0:54:57| Not a large increase, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| And that was with a 1,500-square-foot footprint as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| You look through the neighborhood, that is well below the norm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| As I said, there is one property out there that is just extremely covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3310)|
| 0:55:20| Are you looking at that detailed table that was in our packet, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| that went before MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| That would be, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| And one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| You're going to the back of the lot because you have a drainage easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| in the front of the lot you can't build on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| We have a sewer line that goes through the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3337)|
| 0:55:40| We have a considerable number of trees on the property that one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3340)|
| 0:55:45| immediate neighbors beside us requested that who, to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| is in support of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I know Mr. Prosser said that they got nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| almost nobody that was in support of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| I can tell you verbally they told us they had no problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| They are an immediate neighbor to the right side of the dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| And they said, just don't tear out the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| Just don't tear out the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| That's part of our plan and we're avoiding an existing sewer line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3370)|
| 0:56:16| The neighbor on the other side of our property that also fronts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| Bridgestone, if we tried to move this up and attach it to the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| you talk about somebody that's really impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| I mean, it would be in his back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| And so we are trying to be sympathetic with the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| and there are some restrictions on the property that are placing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| structure where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Thank you for answering the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| In reading through the materials in the package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I'm concerned that there hasn't been a greater effort on the part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3409)|
| 0:56:55| two parties to actually meet face-to-face and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| In reading through the materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| it seems that meetings have been held that one party was not included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| Maybe that was by choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Maybe that was by design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| I really would feel a lot better about this if there had been more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3434)|
| 0:57:19| conversation between the two parties instead of what appears to be squaring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3439)|
| 0:57:25| off and drawing a line in the sand or maybe down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3445)|
| 0:57:30| So that disturbs me about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| I'm in sympathy with both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| But at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| it bothers me that there's not been more conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| more attempt to come up with some kind of a better understanding than we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3459)|
| 0:57:45| seeing from the evidence in the package and the amount of emails we've gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3465)|
| 0:57:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| We have a motion and a second to approve the appeal of the Homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3483)|
| 0:58:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| The motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3485)|
| 0:58:06| The motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Or the appeal is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| I'd like to say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| I don't agree with the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| You are voting against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| So it is 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| And the appeal is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| Ms. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| 11A, a resolution to add the honorary street name of IBEW 760 Drive to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3509)|
| 0:58:35| portion of Roseman Drive between Bill Williams Avenue and Branson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3522)|
| 0:58:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3526)|

| 0:58:48| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3528)|

| 0:58:50| The motion is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3530)|

| 0:58:55| agreement with the Knoxville Area Urban League to transfer to it any interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3535)|
| 0:58:59| in program income, promissory notes, and accounts receivable associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3539)|
| 0:59:04| with the Empowerment Zone Small Business Loan Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3548)|
| 0:59:09| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3549)|
| 0:59:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3551)|
| 0:59:12| There's a young lady in the back from the Urban League, and I wonder if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| she wouldn't mind stepping up to the podium and telling us something she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3555)|
| 0:59:20| told me in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3560)|
| 0:59:21| But I think it's very interesting, and that is part of the reason why they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| are doing what they're doing in order to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| And I think it's helpful to our citizens to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| My name is Phyllis Nichols, 9711 Valley Woods Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you to Mayor and Council for entertaining our resolution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3576)|
| 0:59:45| The Urban League has been facilitating this program in partnership with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3585)|
| 0:59:51| the city since 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| And a program with the intent that it not be something that is just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3594)|
| 1:00:03| short-term program, but that's something that would be a long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3603)|
| 1:00:10| commitment to economic development in our lower and low-to-mod communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3610)|
| 1:00:20| Our track record has been good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3620)|
| 1:00:24| I think the outcomes of what we've been able to achieve in partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| with the city and the community development financial institution is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| opportunity to leverage what we have done with the Empowerment Zone Small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3634)|
| 1:00:40| Business Loan Program to develop a partnership with the treasury to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| continue to do this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| It enables us to not only bring additional capital to the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Knoxville, but also to work with additional small businesses to enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| businesses that are already established, to create jobs, to also bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| financial literacy training and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3667)|
| 1:01:11| It's a unique program in that it must only be through a nonprofit that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3671)|
| 1:01:19| does not have any ties to the government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3679)|
| 1:01:24| So that is we've been working actually with the Office of Community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| Development for several years for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| And so we're hoping to all of the fruits of the labor of what we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| working on together that we'll be able to be successful with your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| So you love us, but without a divorce you can't get that next level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3705)|
| 1:01:49| approval from the federal government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Well, we don't have to call it that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| We think that there are roots and wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3713)|
| 1:01:57| And so we work together to develop roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| And so I think now with the support of wings, we can bring an additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3720)|
| 1:02:06| program to the city that we would not otherwise be able to bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| Further leverage that effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you much for your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you, Ms. Nichols.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| Also want to recognize Felix Harris, who's out there, who has been the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3738)|
| 1:02:21| loan manager for the program all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3741)|

| 1:02:28| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| I just want to take this opportunity to thank Ms. Nichols for the very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| fine work that she and the Urban League have done through the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| serving the inner city community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| And this community is much better off for the very fine work that they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=3767)|

| 1:27:00| I know it's a major job, and some of them may be too small to even try to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5220)|
| 1:27:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5227)|
| 1:27:08| These are all large firms that were involved in this design contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| But Cannon Cannon is a women-owned farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| Angie Cannon works with her husband, Harold Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5232)|
| 1:27:15| It's a women-owned farm that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| So we're very proud to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| I know that we're trying to increase the city's use of minority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5238)|
| 1:27:24| and women-owned businesses, and so I just wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5247)|
| 1:27:28| This is a place where we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| We're absolutely doing that on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| There may be some subcontracting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5251)|
| 1:27:33| Hopefully we'll be with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5253)|
| 1:27:36| You hope and we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5256)|
| 1:27:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5257)|
| 1:27:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| I'm very excited about this as well, and I'm certainly supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| Unfortunately, my firm does work for Cannon and Cannon, so I have to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| It's quite painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| Do you want to go out in the audience and maybe represent them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5276)|
| 1:27:57| Councilman Delvopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| I'm excited about the project, too, contrary to popular belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| I was concerned about the amount of money for the design work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Scratching around, it appears we've paid roughly a million dollars to Vaughan and Milton over the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| It was $996,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| And they designed a lot of these roads that are mentioned in the AIS as things that we're going to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| and redo and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| They did a lot of the design work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| And then we paid Hargreaves and Associates about $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| They had a $535,000 contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| And I see now that we're coming up to close to $700,000, $667,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| And I was just concerned that it seemed like a lot of money thrown at the design of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| And I realize perhaps it has evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5323)|
| 1:28:45| It's more than just a simple five-acre passive park and you've got all that river interface.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| But I was concerned that it seemed like we're designing our hearts away here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| And I was just curious if there wasn't a less expensive way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5335)|
| 1:28:59| Trust me, we tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| We tried hard to get here at the lowest dollar possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| This is the way it worked out in the professional world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| And Angie or Jason could step up and talk about that if you would want that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| But remember, half of this is for construction management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| Only half of it is for design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| And once again, talking purchasing, Evans this afternoon, he says he's saying roughly run 10 to 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| If there's construction management, they're usually closer to 12 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| We have a total project here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| We think this first phase may be up to 7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| So we're way below the design, those percentages in design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5375)|
| 1:29:36| And we're sitting on roughly, what, $8 million left in our fund for the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5381)|
| 1:29:42| That's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5383)|
| 1:29:44| My other question was in the AIS, there's a reference to an arboretum in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| And I was just curious why we've got this wonderful Knoxville Botanical Garden and arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5388)|
| 1:29:53| Why are we replicating that in our five-acre park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| Well, there's lots of statuses of arboretums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| There's lots of places around town that would achieve arboretum status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5399)|
| 1:30:03| So as we develop the planting plan out here, that's certainly one of the goals is to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| That was one of the goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| I should mention, when we got into this, this plan has been thoroughly vetted to a lot of public process back about four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| And this is what the public came with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5417)|
| 1:30:19| We didn't choose to redesign the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| We chose to take what was here, run with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Once we get some cost estimates in, we may do some value engineering at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| I was hoping McFrugal or someone would show up and find a cheaper way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5429)|
| 1:30:33| But I appreciate what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| And I think that it's one of the things that's going to help spark that whole South Waterfront development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| with the residential and the other pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| We're very hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| And we're very confident that will happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| Hold tight on those purse strings, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| I saw it said up to 667.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| I assure you that we will spend the fewest dollars necessary to complete this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| We have many things that we want to spend our money on in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| And so I assure you that we share that desire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| We're all on board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5469)|
| 1:31:10| We're all on board for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| I have one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5472)|
| 1:31:13| Bob, do you have any developers that have taken any interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| If you guys would come through with this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5479)|
| 1:31:21| that they're going to be interested in one of these designated lots that you've talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5481)|
| 1:31:25| The short answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Those lots, most of those lots are under control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| As you know, developer lots, the Connelly and Stevens team that was here at the beginning five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| they're very interested to see what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| And if we take the right first steps, I think you'll see they'll be in there behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| Because five years ago, this was kind of going to be in conjunction with their development, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5509)|
| 1:31:50| And now we're kind of building it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5510)|
| 1:31:51| We're going to get out in front of the development and make sure that we get it started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| And there's a lot of demand for the park throughout south Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| If there's no development at all, there's a lot of demand for this kind of park throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5518)|
| 1:32:02| I think having the bathrooms and the restrooms on the south side will be big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| You'll recall I announced at the budget here, at the budget luncheon last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| that our goal was to catalyze this, to use this as a catalyst.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| And as we're coming out of this recession, we're seeing more and more interest in development in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5534)|
| 1:32:20| We feel like this is a good step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| As was mentioned, this is good for all of the citizens of Knoxville to have this public park like this on the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5541)|
| 1:32:29| And we believe then that it will lead to future development by the property owners that are adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5549)|
| 1:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5560)|
| 1:32:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| We have one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| So the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| One abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| 11M, a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an amendment to a contract between the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5572)|
| 1:32:59| and Knoxville Zoological Gardens so as to allow for the sublease of rooftops to host solar energy systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5587)|
| 1:33:09| I think you probably want to say something and then I want to say something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| What I would like to do is recognize that Jim Volna is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Please stand, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| Jim, as you all know, has been the director for 21 years, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| And he is, fortunately for him maybe, unfortunately for us, he is retiring at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5605)|
| 1:33:32| And we just want to recognize you and thank you for the excellent job that you have done at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5612)|
| 1:33:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5618)|
| 1:33:52| Thank you very, very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| It's really been a pleasure and an honor for me to do this all these years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5634)|
| 1:33:59| I've always said I have the best job in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| And that still goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| No, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5647)|
| 1:34:08| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| We'll have to fight for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5649)|
| 1:34:11| Let's get the Tigers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| Well, every once in a while it's a chore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| If I may, I would like to introduce the interim director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| Yes, I was going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5663)|
| 1:34:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Lisa New has been with Knoxville Zoo for 22 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5665)|
| 1:34:30| She's actually been there longer than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| And she's had a number of positions while there and has worked herself up to now interim director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5673)|
| 1:34:39| but has led the animal collection for 12 years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| So brings a lot of expertise to the position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| And the zoo is in very, very good hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5687)|
| 1:34:52| And we have a tremendous board, too, that is going to keep the place going really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| I think we have a few members of that board here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| One of them will speak in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Thank you, and thank you, Lisa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| We look forward to working with you in your interim role as executive director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| Thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Mayor Brown and I both serve on the zoo board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| And as we have looked at ways to make the zoo stronger and better than it is, and also to manage costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5713)|
| 1:35:21| sustainability jumped to the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| And so Lisa New initiated contact with Susanna Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| And they put their heads together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| And they noted that a sausage maker in this area has gotten very much into solar energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| And that company would be Wamplers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| And so this would amend the contract the zoo and the city have so that we could go on with some solar energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| systems, which will save the zoo money in the short term as well as the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| We're not going to make sausage, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5753)|
| 1:35:54| We're not making sausage at the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| No, we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| But we are going to be having some very strong cost-saving steps in sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| And so I want to thank Lisa for taking the leadership on that before she became the interim director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5763)|
| 1:36:09| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5771)|
| 1:36:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5772)|
| 1:36:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5775)|
| 1:36:16| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| 12A, an ordinance amending Chapter 2 of the Knoxville City Code to delete the existing Article 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5778)|
| 1:36:26| and to add a new Article 2, Division 13, creating a Department of Public Assembly Facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| and the Public Assembly Facilities Advisory Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5792)|
| 1:36:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5796)|
| 1:36:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5799)|
| 1:36:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5800)|
| 1:36:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5801)|
| 1:36:42| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5804)|
| 1:36:45| We are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5805)|
| 1:36:46| If I could just ask one thing for Charles, would you, when you get a chance, look at Page 287, that's Section 2-434.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5806)|
| 1:36:55| I didn't quite see where the 3rd District had an appointment on this board, and I was just curious if that was a mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| or a typo or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| The 3rd District has a person who has, I think, two years left in his term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| He was a fairly recent appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| So that's probably why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| I noticed that also, but I also know that he.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| I didn't know if it was an omission that we had to correct this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Every council district and every at-large council person has an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| And what we had to do in that long kind of complicated paragraph there was to get them, under this new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5845)|
| 1:37:35| get them staggered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5855)|
| 1:37:36| And we've got some terms that are inconsistent or they're coming off at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| So we're trying to get a good rotation with a set schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5862)|
| 1:37:47| And that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5867)|
| 1:37:48| And that at-large member then will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5871)|
| 1:37:52| Each of you will now be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| In fact, Jackie Clay, who handles boards and appointments, board and agency appointments for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5873)|
| 1:37:59| she will be contacting you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| And also the 1st District Councilman, well, Vice Mayor Pavlis, he has an appointment as well because your appointment is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5881)|
| 1:38:12| the term is expiring in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| There's a few others that will be expiring this year in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5895)|
| 1:38:19| And Jackie will be letting you all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5899)|
| 1:38:21| So start thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| We do, this resolution calls for term limits for the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| And so you can look and Jackie can let you know how long the person has been serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5907)|
| 1:38:32| And then you can reappoint the person or appoint somebody new depending on their status and your desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5912)|
| 1:38:40| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5920)|
| 1:38:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5921)|
| 1:38:42| I was just afraid we had an omission, just a technical drop or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| If I may, I would like to thank Ron Mills for his work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5926)|
| 1:38:50| He put a lot of work into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| But you all probably don't know what an avid proofreader your mayor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| And Ron and the mayor worked together to make sure that everybody got their necessary appointment in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5936)|
| 1:39:03| They both spent a lot of time on making sure this was done correctly and getting the terms staggered appropriately and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5943)|
| 1:39:09| I was amazed at the type of legalistic proofreading that your mayor is capable of doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| But I don't care to do it often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| That's why we have a legal team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| Did you have Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5964)|
| 1:39:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5965)|
| 1:39:26| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5968)|
| 1:39:29| We're finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| Actually, we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5973)|
| 1:39:36| Then I will go ahead and use public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5978)|
| 1:39:39| Mayor, I didn't know what the administration, what you folks are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| This concerns East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| And I know that we're moving the police station out of East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| I know that we had it there for, I think, what, 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| Fifteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| And I'm very familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| We were the architects for the police center there as well as some of the other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| And my concern is that I know we've all been watching and seeing how East Town Mall is struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| And I was wondering what kind of effect this was having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| I know that the rent was more than what these other places are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| But what are we doing in terms of trying to help East Town Mall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6014)|
| 1:40:19| I guess that's what I'm interested in doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Because I think taking the police out of there may make a big difference from the standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6021)|
| 1:40:25| of just the whole idea of safety and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| So I am concerned about East Town Mall and what's happening in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6029)|
| 1:40:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6034)|
| 1:40:35| We are concerned about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| I will tell you that the, I think we've had a discussion before about just the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6037)|
| 1:40:43| and that the nature of malls and the commercial, the retail part of malls is changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6043)|
| 1:40:51| you know, across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| We are, however, investing in that area because whether it restays a mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| or becomes something else in the future, we are, right now, maybe Jim Hagerman can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6058)|
| 1:41:05| We are making improvements to Millertown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6065)|
| 1:41:10| Do you want to talk about that, just the investment we're making there right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| This is Jim Hagerman, director of engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6074)|
| 1:41:20| Millertown Pike is going to get a, there's a real traffic bottleneck at the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| That's going to get widened, an additional turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| That should relieve some of the congestion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| There's also a major project going on at Washington Pike, the other side of the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6093)|
| 1:41:39| to attempt to relieve some of the congestion there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| And that's a widening project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| We're still in the environmental phase on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| So there's a little bit of design and environmental studies going on with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6108)|
| 1:41:54| So it's going to be easier to navigate around that area, get in and out of the mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6114)|
| 1:42:02| and we're also looking at the possibility of doing some with MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6122)|
| 1:42:10| looking at some, what do you call them, corridor overlay, corridor district overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6130)|
| 1:42:20| for the Washington Pike area to see if we can make that work better as a business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6140)|
| 1:42:28| and generally look nicer and fit together better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6148)|
| 1:42:33| Well, I was just curious, did the mall not want to really work with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6153)|
| 1:42:35| in order to keep the police stationed there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| I mean, what was the, what was kind of the history there on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| I'll call on our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| We've had a great relationship with the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| I was one of the officers that first went into the mall back around 97 or 98,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| and it was a great marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| As time has gone by, the rent has continually gone up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| and there was a lot of efforts made to be sure that we could stay in the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| But with the mall being for sale and some of these new properties coming available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| and the rent increases and we were able to get more square footage in these new facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| it was just a great time for us to leave, and it's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| We know it will have some impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| It's kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| The mall is struggling, but all of the surrounding businesses, Lowe's and Target and Kohl's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6203)|
| 1:43:29| as I understand it, continue to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| And so I'm sure there's a lot of economic reasons, but as you look across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| malls in general are starting to struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| And so there certainly was a lot of discussion, and they wanted us to stay and we wanted to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| But as the cost went up, we just had to seek other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Councilman Gallo, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6231)|
| 1:43:52| I'll just follow up on that, but you are still going to provide them adequate police protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| so that there will be this sense of safety that Councilman Greer was talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6236)|
| 1:44:01| Absolutely, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| Okay, and we have somebody that signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| Vinny Anastasio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| Is that person here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6249)|
| 1:44:13| Vinny Anastasio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6253)|
| 1:44:17| Okay, so he's not here, so there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| Happy holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| We'll see you next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| Merry Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265121220?start=6264)|
