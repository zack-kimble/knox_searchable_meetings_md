| 0:01:21| We have ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=82)|
| 0:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| Madam Clerk, would you please introduce the first item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| The item is the 2019-RZ request of James S. Monday, Robert A. Monday Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| for rezoning from agricultural to L.I. Linden Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| The property is located at 8810 Balgrove Road, parcel ID 13827401, in Commission District 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=92)|
| 0:01:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Mr. Green, could you give us a quick overview?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=106)|
| 0:01:47| By a vote of 13-0, the Planning Commission recommended approval of rezoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=107)|
| 0:01:54| E.C. Employment Center for this 2.8-acre parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=114)|
| 0:01:57| The Employment Center zone replaced the L.I. Linden Industrial zone in the rural area in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| 2001 when that policy plan was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| The major difference between the E.C., the Employment Center, and the L.I. Linden Industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| zone is that the E.C. zone requires plan approval by the Planning Commission for any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| or redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| Both require significant setbacks, no parking in the setbacks, landscaping, buffers from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=138)|
| 0:02:24| adjacent residential and agricultural zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Again, the major difference between the Employment Center and the Linden Industrial is the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=147)|
| 0:02:32| for plan approval by the Planning Commission, providing an opportunity for public input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=152)|
| 0:02:37| and public review of the plans for development and redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| Again, the growth policy plan does not permit the L.I. designation in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| It does specifically require the E.C. designation in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=167)|
| 0:02:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| And is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| The Chair will now grant the applicant the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| So, sir, go ahead and just introduce yourself, state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| The way this will work, I don't have any opposition here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=191)|
| 0:03:15| Otherwise, I usually allow both, but if you could clarify exactly what you're asking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| and the body will make a decision moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| My name is Rob Monday, and my address is 902 Kermit Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=207)|
| 0:03:34| That's my place of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| So I'm the property manager for a 55,000-square-foot building in far south Knoxville at 8810 Valgro Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=217)|
| 0:03:45| and I took this project on about 24 months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| And since that time, we have been working really, really hard to address important issues in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=228)|
| 0:03:54| This property is better known as the Camel Manufacturing Facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=234)|
| 0:04:01| I got a quick education on the history when I took on the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=241)|
| 0:04:05| but Camel Manufacturing was actually founded at Valgro Road in 1919,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| and that's been an industrial area since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=251)|
| 0:04:16| They're a manufacturer that serves the U.S. government and the U.S. military,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=256)|
| 0:04:20| and in the 1980s, they actually relocated to a facility up in Pioneer, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| and they sold off the buildings that are currently at Valgro Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| And so there's a rich history there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=269)|
| 0:04:32| The subject property that we're here to talk about today, it's 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| It successfully coexisted with the surrounding community for a very, very long time without any known complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=276)|
| 0:04:42| This is a building that's built for capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| It's got high ceilings, 30, 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| It's got wide open spans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| This is the type of building that could be attractive to a light industrial corporate user| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| that could bring real business to south Knoxville, but it's sitting vacant right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| And a lot of that is due to the ambiguity and the confusion around the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| and so we kind of embarked on a journey about a year ago to try to correct that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=304)|
| 0:05:10| And, you know, when you look at this property, everything about it says that it should be light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=310)|
| 0:05:17| It's been light industrial ever since the building was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| The existing use is light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| The sector plan says that this building, quote, unquote, should have light industrial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| But when the policy plan was put in place and the map was put in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| we believe there was just an error in how they constituted that map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=334)|
| 0:05:38| I mean, this area has been an industrial zone for so long, and it has obviously been a center of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=338)|
| 0:05:46| So the purpose of my standing in front of you today is to try to correct that issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=346)|
| 0:05:51| and to set this property up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| This is an area that has dealt with, has had a pretty difficult path to business viability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=353)|
| 0:06:00| and we're getting there, but one of the cornerstones of setting this property up for success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=360)|
| 0:06:05| is having the proper zoning mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| When you look at the EC zoning, you know, there are only three places in Knox County where EC zoning exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| They are Carnes Valley Business Park, the Midway Business Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=374)|
| 0:06:19| and then there are two parcels at Valgro Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=379)|
| 0:06:23| In all of Knox County, there is one single existing building that has EC zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| The reason all the other parcels that are EC zoned, and there are quite a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| are vacant parcels that are ready for new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| And we can acknowledge that employment center zoning has its merits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| and that it's a wonderful future planning tool to put forth new business parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| that will have all the things that we want to provide for in our future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| The problem is when you take those standards that were created relatively recently in the last couple of decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=412)|
| 0:07:00| and you apply them to a 50-year-old building, the requirements are not kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| And when you get down to the nuts and bolts of what does this mean for the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| I'll tell you what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=430)|
| 0:07:11| It means that it's going to be very, very difficult to get a business open in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| And we've seen that with some of the other EC zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| And so I guess the real point of what I'm trying to say is that getting the correct zoning mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=440)|
| 0:07:32| and having a zoning that a tenant can open in without a year of going through hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=452)|
| 0:07:39| and making changes is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| And sometimes prospective tenants and the relationships that you build with prospective tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=463)|
| 0:07:47| to get them into buildings can be incredibly fragile because they have other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| And so we don't think that employment center zoning is going to set this property up for success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=472)|
| 0:07:58| And when you step back and you realize that this area has been industrial for a very long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| that it's coexisted in this area for a very long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=483)|

| 0:08:10| we just feel that this is, you know, the county commission is the body that has the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=490)|
| 0:08:15| to be the final word on these sorts of decisions and to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=495)|
| 0:08:18| And in this case, I truly believe that the right thing is to give this property the light industrial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| that the sector plan says that it should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=508)|

| 0:08:37| So Commissioner Daley first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=517)|

| 0:10:28| LI has no minimum lot size requirement on the building, and that is 5.60.05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=628)|
| 0:10:38| Landscape requirements vary greatly between an EC zone and LI zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| I'm not even sure with the EC zone that the current property can even fit into this landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=644)|
| 0:10:53| requirements without destroying part of the building and having a cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| It is very tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Part of that landscape requirements is that 1,000 square feet of landscaping for every 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=660)|
| 0:11:08| of building space and plant a tree that maintains a height of 40 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| That would be tough to do at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| It would just be almost impossible to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| Gerald, I'm only following that 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| I know that, but hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| I just wanted to say, I don't know whether to say now or later, but the LI requires 500 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=688)|
| 0:11:38| for every 20,000 of landscaping for every 20,000 square feet of parking and the same tree requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| This would be an existing non-conforming building, so those requirements would not come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=705)|
| 0:11:50| and there's more latitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| I understand it's a conundrum because we have a zone, the only one that's permitted under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| Dirk policy plan here, but doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| The LI doesn't really fit because of its requirements, and this is an old non-conforming use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| and we have to allow some latitude because it is an existing non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=727)|
| 0:12:13| Mr. Sanders could probably speak better to that than I, but through the plan approval process for the EC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| the planning commission could vary some of those standards or accommodate them because of an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=738)|
| 0:12:26| non-conforming use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| I think in summary what this points up is, again, the need to update the general growth plan for the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| and address issues like Mr. Mundy's property and many others throughout the county that don't fit into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=754)|
| 0:12:41| the round pegs that don't fit into the square holes that the growth policy plan has created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=768)|
| 0:12:50| The current light industrial building has the loading dock in front of the building, correct, Rob?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=770)|
| 0:12:56| It does have six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Six, which is not allowed in the EC zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=777)|
| 0:13:03| Mr. Mundy would have to completely redo, well, not now since you've got six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=783)|
| 0:13:08| but you'd have to get rid of that front dock if you have to go with the EC's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=788)|
| 0:13:13| This requirement stands for Mr. Mundy could not have a loading dock due to the EC zone in front of his building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=793)|
| 0:13:23| Real quickly, right across the street was the paint ball that was light industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| and we down zoned to agricultural, so a lot of industrial has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| This has all been light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| I might add, Commissioner Daley, I think Bullet Boat is right out there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| There's right around Caddy Corner to there is where they're already making light industrial Bullet Boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=817)|
| 0:13:43| In 2001 with the growth plan, the Valgrove Industrial Park should have been zoned and mapped as LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=823)|
| 0:13:50| This is where I think we've made the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| It should have been LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| This area's classification needs to be corrected and zoned as LI as requested by Mr. Mundy, and I believe that totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=834)|
| 0:14:03| At our May zoning meeting, Commission approved an error in the sector plan for 3815 Shotsman Lane from O to LI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=843)|
| 0:14:13| due to an error in the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| We have an error, in my opinion, we have an error in the south sector plan today on Mr. Mundy's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=856)|
| 0:14:24| The land use was approved by KKCP on a 12-0 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| This request came before us, and we also approved it back in last month's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| Mr. Mundy is asking that his property be corrected as current to LI as the past use, and it always has been industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=876)|
| 0:14:47| And I am a south Knoxville native, and I've been there in Camelton and Bullet Bass Boats and the Stare Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=887)|
| 0:14:57| and they've been there for years, and they're still there, and we need to get this building back to use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| and it needs to go back to LI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| So I would like to make a motion at this time if I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=904)|
| 0:15:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| My motion is to have 8-H-19-RZ rezone from A Agricultural to LI Light Industrial due to an error in zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=910)|
| 0:15:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| I second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=927)|
| 0:15:28| So we have a proper motion from Commissioner Daley with a second by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| Commissioner Daley, I second your, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=931)|
| 0:15:33| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=933)|
| 0:15:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=935)|
| 0:15:37| Mr. Green, like Commissioner Daley said, the immediate property to the west is already LI, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=937)|
| 0:15:48| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Is it possible that there was errors made years ago that when they did the zoning for this parcel, they just got it wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=951)|
| 0:16:03| That's entirely possible, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=972)|
| 0:16:13| I might weigh in on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| You all may remember a few years ago when Arthur was representing the paintball folks, and paintball and airsoft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=974)|
| 0:16:21| or maybe I think it was actually more airsoft than paintball, but it could have been a dual-use field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| and I had particular interest in that use because my son at the time, one of the daily obsessions was airsoft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| and was following that closely, toured out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| I know the property even though I wasn't able to meet Mr. Monday out there to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| Also, during the Bass Tournament, we got a VIP tour out there of the Bullet Boat Factory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| which is adjacent to that particular property, and I know the owner of that particular light industrial application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| which is an incredibly efficient small manufacturer business here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| So I guess having walked that property on multiple occasions, the only thing I didn't like, it may have been that factory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| but there was one place out there that had some mean dogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| I remember when we got out there, they kind of scared me a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| But, you know, that was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| I think everything that Commissioner Daley has brought up is very reasonable and very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1036)|
| 0:17:21| Back to the issue of a mistake, I remember specifically when Arthur was here and we were talking about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| was what's so unique, and for those of you who haven't been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| this property, if you're looking the way you view it if you're driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1049)|
| 0:17:34| and when we were first rolling out our codes for Knox County, I guess in the early 70s, late 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| that's one of those areas, if you were driving down the highway there, and if you were looking to the left or to the right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| you would have no idea that any of these buildings were even out there because they were behind the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1064)|
| 0:17:50| So it's very likely when we did that initial setting of our zoning codes for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1070)|
| 0:17:57| that whoever was doing that way back in the day didn't even know they were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| So that, to me, is more of the uncomplicated but most likely way how some of that stuff may potentially have been mis-zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1082)|
| 0:18:10| So what I'm saying is I will be supportive of Mr. Daley's resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| That's a great joke. I just knew there was a joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| You know, there were some scary dogs out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| I remember when I went out there to look at it before the paintball vote, and by Sunday I stayed in the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| So with that said, I see no other lights. That motion is properly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| All in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1112)|

| 0:19:08| As noted, 12-0 on the consent agenda, the Planning Commission recommended approval of the agricultural zoning for this 2.5-acre parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1148)|

| 0:19:42| Okay, the Chair will look for a motion on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1182)|

| 0:20:48| Okay, the Chair will look to Commissioner Beeler for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| I move that we approve per the recommendation of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and we lock agricultural zonings in that district. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1255)|
| 0:20:59| We have a proper motion from Commissioner Beeler with a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1259)|
| 0:21:03| Any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| I know you're moving the properties together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| If we talk today, it looks like a pretty simple, smart deal for the horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| We could just get that one in between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| I know. I know. I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| These horse deals, sometimes you have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| I call them naysayers when they come out against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1278)|
| 0:21:21| So, that said, all in favor, please say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1281)|
| 0:21:26| All against, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1286)|

| 0:21:33| I talked to him today about the horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Yes, I heard that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| Item 5-F-20-RZ is a request of Primus Land Company for rezoning from A Agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1299)|

| 0:21:57| All right, thank you. Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| By a vote of 11-1, the Planning Commission recommended approval of the PR zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| at a density of up to four dwelling units per acre for this 22-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| finding that zoning would be compliant with the land use designation of the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| and the development that would follow could be accommodated by the existing infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1333)|
| 0:22:18| All right, thank you. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1338)|
| 0:22:21| All right, thank you. Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| Okay, I see two hands. Is that right? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Well, what we'll do tonight is I'm going to allow the applicant to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| Josh, I'll give you five minutes, and then the opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| I'll extend the same courtesy to talk about the property or the challenge to what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1356)|
| 0:22:44| Josh Sanderson, 4909 Ball Road, representing Primus Land Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| This is a property we bought a year or two ago trying to do another Smithville subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1368)|
| 0:22:56| We originally asked for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| In reality, we know that the land won't even yield five units an acre with the constraints of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1378)|
| 0:23:06| So we reduced it in the MPC meeting to four units per acre, which is exactly what we think it will yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| It's consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| We're surrounded by other properties that have five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1396)|
| 0:23:21| I know you have had some opposition, and I've talked to a few individuals about traffic, stormwater, school impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1401)|
| 0:23:31| The list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| And we get this on all of our subdivisions or all of our properties that we rezone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| and we are very compassionate to the needs of the homeowners that we are surrounded by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| And when we get more information from Knox County Engineering and a third-party engineering firm that we've hired to do a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1424)|
| 0:23:55| it will dictate our layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| And I think that's a lot of the confusion or maybe a lot of the conversation from the opposition is, how is this layout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| What's your access points?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| How many units will it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Again, I'm here to ask for zoning right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| That's the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| We have hired a traffic impact study or a third party to do a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| We have not got those results back yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| So the second we get those back, we'll be finalizing our concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| I'll reach out to the neighbors on both sides, Blacks Ferry and Patriot's Way, schedule a meeting with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1466)|
| 0:24:34| and see if we can at least come to some sort of agreement that benefits not only the owners on Patriot's Way, on Blacks Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1474)|
| 0:24:43| and in the whole Karnes community, but just in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| Another subdivision we had was right down the road called Emory Brook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| It's at the intersection of Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| We went in front of you all to get it rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| You all rezoned it successfully at 4.2 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| The concept plan and the traffic impact study warranted a left turn lane and a right turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| So in my opinion, the county, the constituents, the citizens of the area got a better intersection because of our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1510)|
| 0:25:23| The traffic impact study said we had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| Knox County said we had to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| We came together with TDOT, with Knox County, and ourselves and did a three-way partnership to improve that intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1527)|
| 0:25:34| in our opinion, benefits the entire area of that, or the region of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| This could be the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| Again, don't know where we are on the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| Should have it within weeks, but it will obviously impact our concept, which we'll go back in front of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1545)|
| 0:25:52| and we'll be sharing our concept with the opposition and the citizens around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| I will yield the rest of my time to answering any questions that you all have out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1561)|
| 0:26:02| What was the name of that intersection, sir, that you just referenced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| Yeah, it's Kate Road in West Emory, right next to Barrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| We'll write down straight from Barrington, Kate Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1572)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| And I know we've got a couple of folks from the opposition on that, and if both of you all would like to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1578)|
| 0:26:25| Unless you've got a designated speaker or Mr. Frazier, you know, kind of, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| We're pretty flexible on this, just I want to make sure you know you're being heard on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| And there may be some Q&A as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| So what's more likely to happen is after you've shared your information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| some of the county commissioners may have some questions and may ask them of you all and or follow up Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1602)|
| 0:26:47| But, you know, starting right off, we'll give you five minutes, and if you need a little bit more, we want to be fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| just let us know because some of the commissioners may have some follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| And, yes, we have got quite a few e-mails on this one, so I do want to make sure you're being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| Can you come to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1619)|

| 0:27:05| Is it five minutes for me and five minutes for Mr. Frazier, or is it the total five minutes for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| Well, I think we gave Mr. Sanderson about five minutes or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| How many did we, oh, we're running to timer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| How long did you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1634)|
| 0:27:16| About two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| So, yeah, you had two minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1637)|
| 0:27:18| But, yeah, just go full five, and honestly, we want to make sure you're heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| Okay, but I also want to be able to Mr. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1642)|

| 0:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| I want to be very fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| My name is Julie Corn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| I do live on Carpenter Road, 7511 Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| I have been a resident in the Carnes community since 1969, so I'm 50 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| My family has been there 80-something years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| And through social media, I've kind of become the spokesperson for the Carnes community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1666)|
| 0:27:53| not only in a huge opposition for the continued construction in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| but we also have other areas of concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| We have road issues that need to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Our infrastructure is nowhere near able to accommodate, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1684)|
| 0:28:12| any more construction until some of that is taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| My whole point is there's what I consider to be a chain link.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| We have new development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| I've just looked at the statistic right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| We have 862 new homes in Knox County just in the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| The Carnes community is a very small community by any stretch of the imagination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| so we feel like there's a lot of homes that are being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| There are 13 Smith-built developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| None of them have been under construction and are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| There's three currently under construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| and this one that is planned as approved from the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| just a couple of weeks ago will be the fourth one under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| We have just spent $8 million on a connector from Carnes Valley to Hardin Valley Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1742)|
| 0:29:09| and no concern about the rest of the infrastructure for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| We have roads that you cannot drive a school bus on and a car at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| One person has to hit the ditch, and it's usually the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| We have kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| We have overpopulated school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| I looked at the statistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1768)|
| 0:29:30| We have 17 to 1 ratio for our students and teachers, which is above the state standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| We have since, on my statistic, from 2000 to 2009,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1778)|
| 0:29:45| we have had 3,000 homes that's within a 10-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| and we are already slated halfway to that point right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and the year is not even but just barely halfway done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1796)|
| 0:30:03| Let me give you some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| The road that either this subdivision is going to come out on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| or is going to navigate into are strictly residential areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| that have been there since 1970-71, Northampton Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1814)|
| 0:30:18| I have spoken to some of those residents in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| They have lived there since the development and the conception of their neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| They will move their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| They will leave the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| They have raised their families there, and to completely uproot a whole family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| because they don't want the headache and the congestion of bringing a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| out of an area that a lady sold there in Carnes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| out their street to destroy where their general area is for their swimming pool is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| There's been no concession of talking to any of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| The road itself, if you come out of Patriot Way and you turn left onto Carpenter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1857)|
| 0:31:03| if you'll allow me to read some numbers, because we took measurements of the road on Carpenter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1863)|
| 0:31:09| which some of this traffic will come out on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| It will feed out of it, and then we have the infamous West Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| Harrell Road, and Carpenter Road, Malfunction Junction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| I'm sure you all remember that from back in the day here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| There's been four wrecks within the last three months that I have gotten information from the THP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| One of them I witnessed myself right in front of me right at that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1891)|
| 0:31:36| I know we talk about a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1896)|
| 0:31:38| We've talked about a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| We've talked about a red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| No red light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| State says, yeah, it's in the planning commission, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| They keep saying we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| I don't know until it takes someone that's going to be killed that we're going to get a red light there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| So now we're going to take 300 and something more cars a day and dump into West Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1913)|
| 0:31:59| which is 0.3 miles from that intersection to Black Street Road, which is also a pig's trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1919)|
| 0:32:10| Excuse my country Karnes language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| I mean, it's horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| You can't even go anywhere in Karnes right now as it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| let alone when school's in session, people are going to and from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| I mean, it's horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1945)|
| 0:32:27| I grew up on Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1947)|
| 0:32:28| I can't even turn left off of Carpenter Road to go to Emery Road to get to where I need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Karnes has two major roads, Oak Ridge Highway and Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| Those are the only two ways in, the only two ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| All I'm asking for is some concession for this community to be able to provide safety for our residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| have our infrastructure improved dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| Our schools, we've just now decided we're going to put a new school because Karnes Elementary School is overcrowded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1977)|
| 0:33:04| Well, you've got more homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| You've got more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| You've got more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| You've got more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| You've got more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| See the circle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| More kids, more schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| And it keeps going and going and going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And my question is, when does it stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| When do you have an $8 million intersection when you can't even fix Gray-Hendrix Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| You can't even pave the end of Carpenter Road where it looks like there is a drop-off of about eight feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2004)|
| 0:33:34| Lord only knows when you meet a car there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| and half the people that live on Carpenter Road know how to drive that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| but the people that do not live on Carpenter Road have no concept of what it's like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2020)|
| 0:33:46| Meet a school bus on that road between 4.30 and 5 o'clock in the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2026)|
| 0:33:52| You better hope you found a driveway to pull off into because you won't be moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| Somebody's going to be in the ditch, and it's not going to be the Knox County school bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| There are places in the road that are 15 feet across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| There's another road intersection that's 15 feet across, and this is only halfway down Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| So we need road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| We need road construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| We need infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| And, I mean, the people of Carnes, yes, we moan and groan and bitch and complain about, you know, another subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2060)|
| 0:34:28| but we've got to fix the problems in Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| Okay, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| I do recognize the light from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| So, Commissioner Jay, have you got a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I have a question for Mr. Snowman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| I would love to let both of them talk first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| Okay, Mr. Frazier, would you like to go ahead right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2085)|
| 0:34:50| Greetings from the Carnes community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| My name is Kenneth Frazier, 6111 Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| I appreciate your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| I live on Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I've lived on Patriot Way for quite a few years, three or so decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2104)|
| 0:35:15| Development and progress are not the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2115)|
| 0:35:20| You can develop without progress, and what we're asking for is progress with development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| That's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| With that, I don't think that I've heard of one neighborhood community shouldering the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2131)|
| 0:35:41| burden of the traffic from a new community, which is what they're asking to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| They're asking to take this 84 homes, which I think was 4 homes per acre, 4.2 homes per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Northampton Commons is on the order of 1.3 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| The density is quite marked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| I've read some of the comments that have gone back and forth with emails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| We communicate with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Many of the people in Northampton Commons wanted to be here tonight, but a lot of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| fall in the high-risk category because you do have older people that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| My neighbors are 77 and 81 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2187)|
| 0:36:34| So they picked me to come and stand before you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2194)|
| 0:36:44| We know that the future development that was on the original plat map, and what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| going to hear is that Patriot Way was stubbed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| Instead of having a cul-de-sac, it was just bobbed off at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2213)|
| 0:36:59| There was a tract of land that had future development written on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| I would like to say that that future development is now past development because Ricky Pratt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| the Frasers, and the Bealers are that future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| What they're saying is that Patriot Way was meant to have another development glommed onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2237)|
| 0:37:26| Really, it's only just three houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| I think the traffic studies that at least I was told about would be about 1,100 cars per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| That's a 325% increase above what we already have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| We don't have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| We don't have lane markings or even shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| It's just a neighborhood road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| To shoulder the burden of another 80 or so homes, man, it just doesn't really make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2272)|
| 0:38:01| In order to have true progress with the development, I'm all for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2281)|
| 0:38:06| Hey, Knoxville's growing, and it's going to continue to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| Carnes has the land, so it's going to grow towards Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| We might as well go ahead and put the roads in first to make sure that everybody's safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2294)|
| 0:38:22| We need to put in sound barriers, put in ordinances of how many houses per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| because, hey, four houses an acre is really close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| This development, if you look at it from a satellite view, the development at Kate Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2312)|
| 0:38:38| I'm sorry, what was your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2318)|
| 0:38:40| Josh, that Josh was talking about, it looks weird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2320)|
| 0:38:46| The houses aren't that close together in this area, so it's kind of, it doesn't fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2326)|
| 0:38:58| And in order for us to fit or to make this fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| we are going to have to come up with some infrastructure solutions first before we build the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| so that we can all live in peace and harmony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| Can't we all just get along?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2353)|
| 0:39:17| Thank you, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Spoken like a true relative of the legend Tank Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2358)|
| 0:39:24| All right, and that is true, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Mr. Frazier and I were visiting earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| I do have a couple of commissioners that, all right, Josh, I'll let you go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| and then I know that Commissioner Jay and Commissioner Biggs do have a couple of follow-up questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| and they may be for Josh, you, or the residents, or Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| But, Josh, if you'd like to respond, I know they had some extra time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| and I do want to make sure that you get some extra time to talk to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Just one quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| Again, we've got to have a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| We don't know if we're tying into Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| We don't even know if we'll even come close to touching Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2393)|
| 0:39:56| So I know they're compassionate about the situation, but, again, we're here for the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| We might just have an entrance onto West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| We don't know right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| So the zoning with four units per acre that's consistent with the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| and based on staff recommendations is what we're asking the commission to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| And I'm here for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2413)|
| 0:40:14| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2416)|
| 0:40:27| Yes, sir, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| When I inquired about this area earlier, you talked to me about a new intersection that TDOT is going to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2428)|
| 0:40:40| to sort of connect Carpenter and Harrell across the way from each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| and straighten that out and put a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| The state identified that jointly with us as a high crash location, as this lady mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2449)|
| 0:40:56| and they secured safety funding for that project, but that funding was cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| So I think maybe last month or maybe the month prior to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| this body approved an expenditure for the county to spend a little over a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| to acquire the rights of way, which will primarily include the acquisition of that one commercial business on the corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2471)|
| 0:41:18| where the road on the north will come to Harrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2478)|
| 0:41:28| Carpenter will come to Harrell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| My apologies about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| So we are hopeful to get right-of-way plans on that in the next few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2491)|
| 0:41:36| and start acquiring that right-of-way as soon as the budget is – hopefully the budget is approved in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| But the TDOT funding for actually putting the infrastructure in there has been cut so far, you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| Yes, but our appropriation of a million dollars in this upcoming fiscal 21 budget will make the project whole again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| I guess where I'm getting to is if we make – even if we do acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| if TDOT doesn't have money to supplement it, that we're talking about a minimum of two, three, four years away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| Well, it's my understanding that TDOT does have the construction money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2531)|
| 0:42:15| They just needed some help with the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| I see. Okay. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| So it's my understanding from them that they – as soon as we get the right-of-way purchased, they would commence with construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| And when – what's the best case scenario timeline on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| I would think probably summer of next year we'd get started for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| Okay. And then also the summer 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| And then are there any planned improvements along West Emory, starting at Oak Ridge Highway and going the other direction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2560)|
| 0:42:52| We're also working with the state about the possibility of some partnership at Byington Beaver Ridge at Emory – or Carnes Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2572)|
| 0:43:03| That's a three-way intersection at Two Legs Stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| We have done an analysis and looked at a roundabout and a traffic signal there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| And based on that analysis, find that the traffic signal and turn lanes is warranted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| But Two Legs of that are state-controlled, so we would like for them to put in at least two-thirds of that funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2597)|
| 0:43:23| And once again, they're struggling with finding the funding, but we're committed to trying to partner with them to fix that intersection as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2603)|
| 0:43:31| And then finally, any improvements on the way for Carpenter Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| There is – a while back another developer had a subdivision north of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2617)|
| 0:43:44| Prior to him commencing that subdivision, we would require him to widen Carpenter Road to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2624)|
| 0:43:50| That project hasn't moved forward, so in lieu of that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| Is that all of Carpenter Road? I'm sorry for jumping in so quickly. Is that all of Carpenter Road to be widened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2635)|
| 0:44:00| From Emory to his development. And it would be north of Patriot Way, so it would include the area that this traffic would be adjoining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| And obviously TDOT is going to improve a decent portion of Carpenter to make that alignment tie in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| I don't know if it will go quite to Patriot Way, but they will have a – you know, several –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| they'll have a pretty decent improvement there as part of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And is there any improvement to Blacks Ferry Road in the works at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| No, sir. Not at Knox County or at TDOT that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| Okay. Thanks for your information, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| And I'd love to hear from the commissioner in this district. I have some additional comments, but I'll hold onto those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2675)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah, I know. He's – I'm going to get Commissioner Biggs, and then we'll go to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I'd like to hear from Brad, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Well, I think that – obviously that – one question, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| Do you have access on Emory Road? Do you have property on Emory Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| Yes, sir. This does front West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| Okay. The map that I looked at on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| It doesn't, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| It doesn't. On the map on MPC, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| I'm sorry. So we're – it's a larger parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| It shows only 22 acres because the front of it is zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| So if we get this approved, we're going to get rid of the commercial up front and no need for commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2710)|
| 0:45:16| and we'll just have the residential rezoned, the same zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| So did you buy the church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| No. The church is next door to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| But if you look at the zoning map, the CA, that's ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| That's the additional parcel of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| We're just zoning the agriculture land behind it, the 22 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Are you talking about the east south corner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| It would be the south. It would be the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| South east corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| It's got about 250 feet of frontage on West Emory of commercially – currently zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| and we didn't want to give up the commercial until we knew where we sat with the zoning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| So once this goes through, if this does go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| we will follow this up to reduce that – downzone that from commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| so there won't be commercial on West Emory and rezone it to the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| How far would a road that comes there be from the intersection of Blacks Ferry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2769)|
| 0:46:15| Blacks Ferry, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| It'd have to be a calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| It'd be the – what's the speed limit on West Emory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| 35, 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| It'd have to be at least minimum 400 feet, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| Again, I haven't even thought through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2785)|
| 0:46:31| And, John, before you go, John, you and I have had this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| and Jim and I have had this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| If the traffic study says Patriot Way is the preferred outlet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| what are ways that we can make that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2802)|
| 0:46:47| I guess this question is for you or Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| What are ways that we can make that safer for the residents if that were the proposed traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| For us as the developer, we'd be more willing to sit down with the existing surrounding landowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| and homeowners right there and propose sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| sidewalks down to Carpenters, sidewalks just around the amenity area that they have there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| I noticed today there's probably 30 people at the pool and about 10 cars parked on Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| We could possibly do a parking lot or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| Again, we haven't jumped into there, but we are willing to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| if the traffic study says you need to access Patriot Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2847)|
| 0:47:32| we will compensate in an amenity fashion the homeowners existing that we impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2852)|
| 0:47:38| With either sidewalks, I saw there was no street lighting, possible street lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| Improving that whole pool situation and amenity area right there, we're willing to sit down with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2863)|
| 0:47:49| Again, they'd have to sign off on it too, but we're willing to sit down and play ball with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| I've got a question for Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2874)|
| 0:47:59| Let's say that TDOT comes back and says you can't use Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2879)|
| 0:48:05| but we're forcing you to Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2885)|
| 0:48:10| Is there a feasible way that – I know we've got that development somewhere up north of Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2890)|
| 0:48:18| Would that be part of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| Okay, you make Carpenter up to Patriot Way 20-foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2901)|
| 0:48:24| I don't know how that discussion works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| I think to Josh's point, a lot of that conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| it's hard for me to accurately give good answers until we get that traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2912)|
| 0:48:37| because obviously some traffic would be diverted down, I guess, North Hampton, whatever that other street name is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2917)|
| 0:48:45| So I would kind of want to reserve judgment on that until I saw what the trip distribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2925)|
| 0:48:50| and the numbers looked like before making an informed decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| I'm done for right now, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| He actually raised his hand, this gentleman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| Okay, yes, Mr. Fraser, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| Thanks again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| Kenneth Fraser, 6111 Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| As far as the traffic goes, I have watched the traffic back up from Herald Road and Carpenter on West Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2955)|
| 0:49:30| It will back up all the way to the entrance of North Hampton Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| So the natural outlet for people trying to bypass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| if they're able to go from Blacks Ferry all the way over to Carpenter Road via Patriot Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| I think that the traffic studies are actually going to come out low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| because people are going to try to avoid that natural traffic jam that's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| It's already there without the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| And with the light, it's going to be worse, especially if you add that many more residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| And Smithville is not the only builder that's building on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| There have been developments being built there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3011)|
| 0:50:18| It's just now becoming very congested, which is why it's getting the attention from TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3018)|
| 0:50:30| She mentioned three accidents in the last three weeks or four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| There's probably more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| So I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Patriot Way is not a road that's meant to have a lot of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3039)|
| 0:50:47| As a matter of fact, it's meant to just have the traffic of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| I mean, it's designed to have that many houses on it, the houses that have been there for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3051)|
| 0:50:57| So please consider that when you're thinking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Go out to Patriot Way and look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| We're talking about having a street that should have double yellow lines down the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| with white lines going down the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| This thing does not have any lane markings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| It is a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| It's a lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| So please consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3080)|
| 0:51:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Yes, ma'am, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3086)|
| 0:51:27| Speak brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| I know I want to try to get through all the commissioners and their questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| Okay, 30 seconds or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| How was the traffic study done during this whole pandemic thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3093)|
| 0:51:39| Because if that's the case, schools are not in session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| People are not working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| People are not getting out and busying themselves on their day-to-day life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| So that needs to be taken into consideration for this traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3108)|
| 0:51:52| So I just wanted to throw that out there because I don't think the numbers are going to be very accurate, if at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3123)|
| 0:52:04| Commissioner Biggs, we want to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3124)|
| 0:52:05| Although, did you say that he answered your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| No, I'd like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| Commissioner Biggs, it's to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| Actually, Director Stoddard, I've got a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| So, and then Mr. Green as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3133)|
| 0:52:18| Number one, I went out there and looked at the property in Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3138)|
| 0:52:22| That is a dangerous, dangerous curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| Is there any right-of-way, requiring any right-of-way that we could take almost like a three-lane type ordeal, turning in and turning out for that entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3145)|
| 0:52:37| And Commissioner Andrews is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3157)|
| 0:52:40| I would like to see something done on Carpenter from Patriot Way down if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3160)|
| 0:52:45| I went out there, and it's vital to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| And if there's going to be future expansion out there, it's just something that I feel like needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3168)|
| 0:52:54| If you want to go ahead and answer, then I'll ask Mr. Green a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Commissioner, we've looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| We always look at everything from cost-benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| The amount of work and cost it would take to fix the Blacks Ferry intersection is quite substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3183)|
| 0:53:11| There isn't that much traffic in the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3191)|
| 0:53:14| I think people kind of recognize it being a little bit hazardous and avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| We actually considered making it a ride-in, ride-out, or maybe even closing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3198)|
| 0:53:23| But in our eyes, based on the traffic and the crashes that are occurring at Blacks Ferry, it would be hard for me to recommend a large-scale improvement to that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3203)|
| 0:53:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3213)|
| 0:53:34| Mr. Green, we spoke about the development that might be happening up Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| How many units per acre is that, and do you have the address by any chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| I don't have it available, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3227)|
| 0:53:48| I believe it was about four units an acre, but it is north of Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| Approved, gosh, about a year ago, the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| I was trying to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| So for clarification, concept plan was approved, you think, about a year ago, so it wasn't a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3244)|
| 0:54:09| It's as far as a concept plan has actually been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| I just heard Mr. Green say concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| Is that where it is, or a concept plan has been approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3258)|
| 0:54:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| It was zoned and a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| Zoned and concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| So we've done both the zoning for us, and then concept plan was approved by Planning Commission for that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3262)|
| 0:54:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3267)|
| 0:54:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3271)|
| 0:54:32| This question is for Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| So if I understood, you're going to be taking the commercial property that you guys already own or have an option on and add that to this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3276)|
| 0:54:45| How many acres is the commercial track?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3285)|
| 0:54:49| Two and a half acres, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| It's just the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| It's enough to get a sanitation or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3295)|
| 0:54:56| So you've got about 22 and a quarter on the other and about two and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| It's a 24-acre track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| 24-acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| How many homes are you planning on putting on the total parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Ninety-six is, I think, what we keep coming to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3313)|
| 0:55:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3315)|
| 0:55:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3316)|
| 0:55:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| Jim, our Patriot Way and North Hampton Boulevard, other than the boulevard part, are those standard residential 26-foot roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| I looked at that a few moments ago, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| I haven't measured them, but based on a Google Street view, they appear to be 26-foot wide, curved residential streets like what you would see in most subdivisions in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3332)|
| 0:55:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| I just have some general comments, and I'm sure we're going to get down to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3348)|
| 0:55:53| I drove this area, and I couldn't imagine turning on Blacks Ferry Road at all onto Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3353)|
| 0:56:02| I couldn't hardly imagine Carpenter Road being an intersection that Harold Road is not going to continue to add more and more pressure, even with a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3362)|
| 0:56:13| I agree with one of our speakers that we're not even close to school time, and we're barely back open as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| And it's already kind of madness over in that area to a point of gridlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| When I think of West Emory, this is a huge corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| This is a huge connector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| We're about to approve a huge amount of money on Coward Mill Road in an area that's not nearly populated to accommodate a new school, and appropriately so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3396)|
| 0:56:50| I think it's a great example of getting ahead of the problem that we know is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| But here is an area that is a problem that's already here, and we've ignored it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3414)|
| 0:57:00| And we're hoping that TDOT, I mean, I've been around long enough to know that if it has anything to do with TDOT, you might as well wait two to ten years to see it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3420)|
| 0:57:11| and to add more development and more development and more development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| I mean, this is the equivalent of going to the doctor for the last five years and him saying you're about to have a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3435)|
| 0:57:21| and then going out and eating double cheeseburgers and wondering why you ended up in the emergency room that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| I just can't understand why we would continue to add more development on an area that is already packed to the gills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| Patriot Way, this is a neighborhood street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| This is not a thoroughfare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| Blacks Ferry Road is as dangerous as it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| This is one that I think is a bad idea two to five years ahead of its time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| If we have real plans to help Carpenter Road and help the neighbors that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| if we have real plans to work with the state on widening Emery Road, the entire thing, then great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| Let's keep our development pipeline open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| But this is one I don't think I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| I don't think the infrastructure is there, and I think we're getting to a point where we're about to have a real heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| and we're hoping that things will figure out after the fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| and this is not one that's going to help in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3494)|
| 0:58:19| I'm a property rights guy, and I am a development supporter because I do know we have a growing community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| But to add more growth in an area that is already at the stopping point just doesn't seem like it's smart for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3514)|
| 0:58:35| Mr. Sanderson, I know, but I also have Commissioner Daley's light is weighed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3515)|
| 0:58:40| Are you responding, Mr. J.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| For the first time, Smithfield Homes is ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| This isn't something we need tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| We're not going to be on the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| This is years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| We're not going to be breaking ground on this for 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| We're finally planning ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3531)|
| 0:58:53| So whatever infrastructure needs to happen with the county and everything else, we're getting ahead of it, too, to let you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| There's another 300-acre farm right down the street that we own that we're going to get ahead of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| So this is us as a developer doing our part with the county to get ahead of these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| to make sure you all know what farms are going to be zoned and what farms are going to be subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| This one will have the first footer dug in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3552)|
| 0:59:15| So we'll have plenty of time to get in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| Right now, we have plenty of locations and cars we're building out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| So, again, this is us getting ahead of things, giving you all the opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3560)|
| 0:59:24| Mr. Chairman, if I could just jump back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| If that's the case, then you come to the table with the traffic study done, the road improvements you're going to do done, the concept plan done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3566)|
| 0:59:33| You come ahead of the game and say, we know how we're going to help accommodate these neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| but we're blindly hoping that you're going to come to that after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| But zoning and traffic study don't have anything to do with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| It's concept plan and traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| We don't know how it lays out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| There's no point of giving a traffic study if it's not zoned properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| But you're asking for zoning before you have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| I mean, this is kind of where we get into a little bit of our issues all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| We don't have a sense of what's going to happen before we decide to zone it a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| And this is one where you need to have the whole package together a little bit before we just say, okay, we hope for the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3604)|
| 1:00:11| Because it does infect a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3611)|
| 1:00:15| It impacts a lot of people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| And so I think, you know, I don't mind having a little bit of delay to wait until you come up with more of a solution to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3617)|
| 1:00:25| I guess that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| As a developer, we need the zoning before we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| A traffic impact study is very expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| And before we move forward, if you all say this isn't going to be zoned except for one unit per acre, we're not going to get a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3631)|
| 1:00:38| We're not going to need to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| So it starts with a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| The conversation starts with a zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| You all could honestly zone this property 20 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| It's only going to fit 96 houses on it, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| You all could zone it anything you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| And it's only going to fit the stormwater, rules with stormwater, the traffic impact study, the utilities will dictate this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3652)|
| 1:01:03| Zone it 20, single family, and it will only have four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| So I'm passionate about it because it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| Development is so hard now to do affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| For us to take more, more, more, more time to get some of these things that we don't know the answers to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3675)|
| 1:01:21| first thing starts with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| That's the only thing I know right now is that we need this property that is more than consistent with the density of the area at four units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3682)|
| 1:01:31| And that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| Commissioner Daley, then Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| I understand road problems, and I'm going to have road problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3699)|
| 1:01:42| There's going to be one coming up next month in front of Kay, box planting for 174 units on Governor John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3702)|
| 1:01:50| which you can get on Governor John Severe Highway now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| But this is about zoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| It's not about roads and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Her question is before us tonight is four per acre adequate or too much for this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3718)|
| 1:02:06| And that's what we need to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3726)|
| 1:02:08| And that is Mr. Sanderson is asking for four units per acre, and that's what we need to be looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3728)|
| 1:02:15| And the concept plan will have the road studies and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| So tonight we need to be looking at the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| That's what we need to be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| That was kind of what I wanted to say is there's a process to it, and you start with zoning before you start spending money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| There is a review process, use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| At that point, engineering, MPC get together, and they determine what road improvements after the study is done need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3760)|
| 1:02:50| Maybe it's more than they ever want to try to attempt, and nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| Maybe with the subdivision to the north widening to Patriot Way and them going the rest of the way out, Carpenter Road gets fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3775)|
| 1:03:05| I think at this point it is all about density, compatibility, and how it fits into the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3785)|
| 1:03:12| And then the next stage is engineering, how does it work, or does it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3792)|
| 1:03:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3800)|
| 1:03:21| Mr. Frazier, and then your hand came up, but I also recognize Commissioner Gill has got a question as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3801)|
| 1:03:26| So, Mr. Frazier, if you've got something you want to add in, and then we'll start wrapping it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| All I really want to say is if it's really about just density, then the density is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3813)|
| 1:03:40| Northampton Commons is 1.2, 1.4 homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| They are asking for four, and it's more than double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| So, if we're looking at the current situation with the traffic, and we're talking about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3828)|
| 1:03:55| then really what we need to be discussing tonight maybe is that the density shouldn't be four homes per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| Maybe it should be two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3840)|
| 1:04:03| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| I yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3847)|
| 1:04:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, because that was the direction I wanted to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3848)|
| 1:04:11| But let me make the acknowledgment, because by email and phone calls to me was to acknowledge lots of opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3851)|
| 1:04:19| So, let me first say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| But four years ago when I sat in this seat talking about Knox County's growth plan or nonexistent growth plan that needed to be developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3861)|
| 1:04:29| we continued to come to the point of a conversation that we have to deal with the infrastructure in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| But let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| We don't want to pay for infrastructure in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| That's infrastructure in this county in terms of broadband, infrastructure in this county in terms of our roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| infrastructure for our public works, infrastructure for the health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| We don't want to discuss what it is going to take to deal with the poor infrastructure in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3889)|
| 1:04:57| It is growing, and we continue to drive decisions, decisions and people drive decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| in a manner in which we don't want to have a critical conversation about what it's going to take to develop this county in an appropriate manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3903)|
| 1:05:12| So, let me first say and acknowledge that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3912)|
| 1:05:15| And the second thing is we may be here to answer the question about density and the land use of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| but those decisions impact the neighbors in that area as well as this community in terms of schools, storm water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3922)|
| 1:05:31| in terms of accessibility and the traffic that impacts all of us in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| We're not ready to make some hard decisions, but you may not like part of those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3937)|
| 1:05:42| because with those decisions come long-term planning, tax increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| and other infrastructure conversations that need to be had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| Commissioner Skidmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| This question is for Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| I noticed on the slope analysis that your office prepared, and it says that they recommended 3.75 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Did the planning commission just up it up to an even number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| Staff and the planning commission, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| But the ideal would be 3.75 according to your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3978)|
| 1:06:23| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3983)|
| 1:06:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3984)|
| 1:06:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3985)|
| 1:06:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| One final question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| And, Mr. Fraser, I'm going to ask you this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| So, Mr. Sanderson had mentioned about adding sidewalks and some extra amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3991)|
| 1:06:36| I'm looking at the layout of y'all's neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| I mean, what's your general take on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| I mean, is that something, if this gets approved, I have no idea how the vote's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| People are all over the place on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| But if this gets approved, is that something that, as the designated spokesperson for the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| is that something that, and obviously you're not obligating anything to anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| but, I mean, what's your gut take on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| It would be if this, or if it goes through at 3.75 or a lower level or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| but is that an offer to help with the amenities for the perpetuate way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4029)|
| 1:07:16| Is that something that you think that your neighborhood would even be open to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4036)|
| 1:07:20| I have heard the sidewalk and the parking lot suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4040)|
| 1:07:25| I can tell you right now, the commons area, that's kind of a complicated thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| because that's an organization that doesn't necessarily include the people inside of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| The Northampton Commons pool is a separate entity from Northampton Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| As far as the sidewalks, which side of the street would you go down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| Whose yard would you cut up for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| I don't, that did not go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| I can just say that that idea was not taken very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4078)|
| 1:08:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4088)|
| 1:08:09| One question back to Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| With the commercial property on that front area, and you said that's about two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| if that two acres were added back in or rezoned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| would that be a rezoning that would ask for zero units per construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| that would not change the size of the build here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| or would that just kind of be plugged back in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| Because I could see if this approves at 96, your number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| and then if you go back and get that commercial area, would that change that or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4112)|
| 1:08:39| No, that 96 is the 96.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4119)|
| 1:08:41| That's the entire 24 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| With or without the commercial footage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| With the commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| I'm going to go to Commissioner Smith and back to Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Mr. Frazier, I'm sorry to make you come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| But, Joshua, he's on his way up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4135)|
| 1:08:57| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4137)|
| 1:08:59| If the traffic impact study comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| and the only feasible way out is through this commercial piece of property directly onto Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| Mr. Frazier, would you all still oppose it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4151)|
| 1:09:15| Are you saying that if the egress and ingress for this development came out directly onto Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4155)|
| 1:09:26| the only thing that I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| and these are from the people that are going to be directly adjacent to that particular development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| is that they would want a privacy fence of some sort to separate it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| Because we know that the houses are going to be jammed up closely to the backyards of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| That's the only thing that I've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| An evergreen buffer or privacy fence or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| A sound buffer of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| But taking the traffic out of your neighborhood is your main objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4199)|
| 1:10:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Very good, clarifying question, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Yeah, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| You've got a question for Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| If you have two acres commercial down there, technically to put a road in you only need 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4210)|
| 1:10:18| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| That would still leave you commercial property down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4219)|
| 1:10:22| so it probably would not add anything to I'm sure you would just slice off what you needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4222)|
| 1:10:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| We are roughly laying this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| We're not even considering commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| We don't want to do commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4234)|
| 1:10:35| We're not commercial people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| This is a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4236)|
| 1:10:39| We kept the commercial as a bargaining chip for this zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| so if this can get approved at four years an acre, that will be on next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| or whenever we get on the agenda to remove that commercial completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| and rezone it the same zoning that we get tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4251)|
| 1:10:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4257)|
| 1:10:58| And, Gerald, I have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| It's kind of off topic, but across the street on Emory, I see a PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| Is that plant commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| What is that doing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4267)|
| 1:11:08| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| That was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| I could ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4272)|
| 1:11:13| You might have been on the commission when it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4273)|
| 1:11:20| I'm going to cut you on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| He's got me next month on the cut on the way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| Ma'am, I saw your hand go up, and then I'm going to go back to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4288)|
| 1:11:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Thank you all so much for being generous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Mr. Smith, regarding completely right down onto Emory Road, that is a huge blind curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4296)|
| 1:11:42| You're going to have Blacksberry, which will be, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| maybe 50 feet from the proposed entrance that you were asking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| and then another 50 to 100 feet, maybe a little bit more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| You're going to have the entrance to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| so you're going to have an entrance to one neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| an entrance to another neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4319)|
| 1:12:01| and an entrance to Blacksberry Road that Mr. J had mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| So you're going to have three pretty significant entrance and exits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4327)|
| 1:12:14| just wind up literally side by side onto Emory Road, which is already a crazy way to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4334)|
| 1:12:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Have you got that sitting there looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| Have you scaled that sitting there looking at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4352)|
| 1:12:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| I'm going to go back and order lights with Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4357)|
| 1:12:38| and then I'm going to go back to Commissioner J unless you all want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| I just have a super quick question for Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| Jim's doing public math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| I don't know if that's smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| I think he can walk and map and chew gum at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| 131, this area that we're talking about, this is all state-controlled area, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| Yes, yes, State Route 131, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| What's the likelihood of the state on a road that they know is a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| granting access to a completely new road on a couple hundred feet from a blind curve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| In your expert experience with the?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| I think if I were the state, I would want to limit my access points along the main route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| just because of the fact that the more access points you have, the more conflict points you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| So that would be my thought if I was the state traffic engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4407)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Hey, stay right there, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Quick question, and I don't even know if Mr. Sanders or Josh is interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| First question I have is, so you got Blacks Ferry, and we talked about eliminating Blacks Ferry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| and you got all this property that Smithville got under contract, I assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4428)|
| 1:13:54| Will we be able, with what they own and the work we could do with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| is to eliminate or move Blacks Ferry up the road a little bit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| And I'd have to defer to Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| I don't think they control the corner intersection there, the corner property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4446)|
| 1:14:11| I think there's a couple of properties between their property and the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4451)|
| 1:14:19| Okay, I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| It would be nice, but I think the key point is that one corner property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| because it sits so much in elevation above it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| You'd probably have to do a significant amount of grading to get that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Well, I was looking at the CA, thinking it was in the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| My next question is for Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4478)|
| 1:14:39| I was looking at this agricultural zoning that it currently has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| but the owner of it currently is an apartment, Spring Place Apartments Limited Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4483)|
| 1:14:50| Is that you all, Josh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| Okay, but you couldn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| My question is, I'm just making sure we couldn't do worse with the current zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| with putting apartments on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Sorry, you know, it was a 1031 exchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| We sold apartments down in Spring Place and Loudoun County, and we 1031-ed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4502)|
| 1:15:06| So we went ahead and bought this land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| I was just making sure we couldn't do apartments on this land as it currently sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| As current zoning, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| Keep in mind, though, with planned residential, you could do apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4514)|
| 1:15:18| but only at the density approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| I think Jim had a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4523)|
| 1:15:24| Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| To your point, Randy, it's about 1,300 feet from the center line of North Hampton Commons Boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| to Blacks Ferry, so about 1,300 feet is the separation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| What would they require to be if they granted that access?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| What are the distances on both sides of those that you would require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| Gerald, do you know in the subregs what the spacing requirements on an arterial is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4549)|
| 1:15:54| They would meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4554)|
| 1:15:55| It would be 400 or 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| About 500 at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4558)|
| 1:15:59| So, yeah, I think they would meet that spacing requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| I know we're all still doing research on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| My personal take on it would be the easiest way for this one just personally would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4571)|
| 1:16:16| if you could find a way to make it work without accessing through Patriot Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| But what I'm hearing is that we're wondering whether the state would actually approve that access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4580)|
| 1:16:26| But anyhow, we do need to get back to the vote and see if anybody wants to make a motion on this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| to get things moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| The vote is specific to the density on this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| And I do appreciate everybody looking at this for both the big picture and the small picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4600)|
| 1:16:45| I guess my issue is with obviously what it does, what the impact does on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4605)|
| 1:16:55| I think that the zoning is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| But I wish there was a better fix or a more clear picture of what that does traffic-wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| I have full confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4625)|
| 1:17:08| Some comments have been made tonight about ignoring the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4628)|
| 1:17:15| If it weren't for this commission putting Carpenter and Harrell Road back on the drawing board, it was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4635)|
| 1:17:24| And so we're not ignoring the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| I've asked Jim for this for six or seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| I've asked for a traffic change at Byington, Solway, and Emory for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4653)|
| 1:17:39| These are all state routes, and we have no control over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4659)|
| 1:17:44| Now, we could do better on Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| I'd love to close Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| I'd never turn left out of Blacks Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| I always turn right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| But also hardly ever turn left out of my road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| I can't pass two cars without slowing down or stopping on my road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4675)|
| 1:18:00| That behind me is going to be probably three to four an acre very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4680)|
| 1:18:07| I mean, I have longed for this county to have a long-term traffic plan in every district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| You go to the 8th District, you go to the 9th District, the roads are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| And we're growing, and we've got to figure, you know, Hardin Valley is the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4698)|
| 1:18:22| I drive west of Emory twice a day, every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| And it is busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| And there are times at Carpenter Road and Harrell Road that you can't turn left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4708)|
| 1:18:34| You've got to go right and make a loop or make another turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| But I think tonight we're voting on the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| And I hope that as the plan is presented, the traffic study is presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| that it is a heavy upgrade in safety around the area when it's placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4727)|
| 1:18:54| And so I'm going to make a motion that we approve what Planning Commission has approved through MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4734)|
| 1:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| And that was for four units an acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| So we have a motion for approval per Planning Commission recommendations from Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| I heard Commissioner Daley has a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| So we have a motion from Commissioner Anders, a second from Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4763)|
| 1:19:24| Additional discussion from Mr. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4764)|
| 1:19:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4769)|
| 1:19:30| I'd like to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| And I realize this is at the beginning stages of the development of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| and we can't mandate road improvements and all that at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| So what I'd like to do is make a substitute motion to use the density that the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4784)|
| 1:19:52| used in their slope analysis and make it for 3.75 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4792)|
| 1:19:58| which is basically a reduction of six home sites on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| We have a substitute motion proposed by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| It dies for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| Back to you, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Where are you approaching?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| Is there any additional discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=4828)|

| 1:30:02| By the vote of 7-5, the Planning Commission recommended approval of planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| zoning at a density of up to 2.5 dwelling units an acre because that density is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| with the slope analysis for the property, a significant amount of which is in the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5411)|

| 1:30:17| There was quite a bit of discussion among the planning commissioners as to whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| three dwelling units an acre was appropriate or the 2.5 dwelling units an acre was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| 2.5 dwelling units an acre won out by a slight margin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5429)|
| 1:30:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5434)|
| 1:30:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| And I see the applicant is present and I have any opposition walked in in the last little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| I'm going to look to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| He's got a slide on first, but there may be some other questions as well about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5444)|
| 1:30:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| Just being honest, this is a pretty nice piece of property, but I think it's an excellent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5449)|
| 1:30:57| opportunity for the county and the landowner or the new developer to use the mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| the special district, to maybe add some green space, maybe talk about some amenities for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| And I think, I hope that Ms. Rowland will take that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| You'll take that to her that I'm not committing the county to anything, but as the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5475)|
| 1:31:22| might be interested, I think it would behoove them and the county to get together to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5482)|
| 1:31:25| if we can create something kind of neat for the community right there, along with some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| density and development as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| And we completely agree, and that's why we are asking for the three dwelling units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| acre, because that gives us more flexibility in being creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| I mean, most of the time I'm up here representing a developer that has something in mind for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5502)|
| 1:31:47| the property, and it's a bit unique that tonight I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| I'm representing a landowner who has some foresight to see if she is able to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| piece of property rezoned to this density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| It makes it more marketable and allows more flexible consideration for green space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| I mean, this property is bounded on three sides by Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| There's a lot of opportunity for things to be done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| But in order to do that, there has to be some financial flexibility incentive for the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5531)|
| 1:32:16| whomever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| It's not under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| There's not a developer that is earmarked for this piece of property right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| But whomever that may be, by allowing the additional density, it helps with that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5543)|
| 1:32:29| You know, one of the conversations that came up during the planning commission, the initial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| vote was to approve the density at three dwelling units an acre, and that was a 6-6 tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5553)|
| 1:32:39| There were two commissioners missing from that vote, and I do believe had they been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5559)|
| 1:32:44| that probably would have made the difference in what the planning commission's recommendation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5564)|
| 1:32:49| But the vote was a 6-6 tie, and then Commissioner Boyer, in order to allow the development to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| go forward with the rezoning, voted yes for both the rezonings at three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5573)|
| 1:33:00| and two and a half dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| But this is not something that was mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| The planned development process that was recently adopted by the county would allow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5588)|
| 1:33:13| had that been a tool available, I understand that this is something that we might be able to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| instead of the density, but that's not allowed in the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| And the bulk of this property, 210 acres, is within that rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5602)|
| 1:33:30| If only we had some more foresight, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| Well, our only option then is for the three dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| I mean, a common tactic for a developer, someone who would come in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| I want five dwelling units an acre, to give and take in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| That wasn't even available because of the rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| Three dwelling units an acre is all we can ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| The two and a half came from a function of the hillside protection, which are guidelines only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5632)|
| 1:33:59| It's not something that we're bound by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5639)|
| 1:34:01| And if you factor in the hillside protection analysis, it does come out to two and a half dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| Most of the steeper topography is actually in that 38-acre sliver that's to the east of Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5648)|
| 1:34:18| that's actually currently in the planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5658)|
| 1:34:24| The part that's in the rural area is a lot more sloped, less sloped, gentle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5664)|
| 1:34:31| 170 acres would not require any consideration for the hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| So, again, I'm asking for this commission to consider three dwelling units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5676)|
| 1:34:41| because I think that will allow this commission and the planning department at the concept phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| additional phases, to really present the best development possible for this really unique piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| I'd like to make a motion that we approve with three dwelling units per acre on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5698)|
| 1:34:59| Okay, we have a motion from Commissioner Anders to approve it three with a second from Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5699)|
| 1:35:03| It was the first one I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5703)|
| 1:35:04| A few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5704)|
| 1:35:05| Do you all mind if I jump in first with the questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Ben, I drove that property today from stem to stern in my Jeep to the far end right out near the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| through the fields that hadn't even been cut yet for hay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| Actually, I ran into the owner when I went out there to take a look at it, and she gave me a tour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5718)|
| 1:35:24| So, yeah, one of the best properties in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5724)|
| 1:35:28| It's just an absolutely gorgeous farm, and I know part of her kids are spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| And, you know, actually it seemed as if she didn't really want to initially set, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| there's that far back end that looks like the peninsula out near the creek that might be the area where her interest is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| but she does want to get the entire property changed really just to give flexibility over the next 10 years or 15 or 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5744)|
| 1:35:52| I personally didn't detect any super sense of urgency on that to act on selling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5752)|
| 1:35:59| although, you know, she did mention she had spoken to, you know, one of our local developers more recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5759)|
| 1:36:06| Although looking in the past on that property, one thing that confused me a little bit on the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5766)|
| 1:36:10| is some of the stuff that you submitted had some of the drawings and the sketches from Mr. Campbell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| were in part of your packet that you sent to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| And at first, frankly, when I spoke to her, I said, you know, I mean, I met the dog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| But then I said, now, have you got an option with Darby Campbell on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5783)|
| 1:36:27| You know, kind of what's going on, and it really threw her off because of some of those past documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5787)|
| 1:36:31| And I know Mr. Campbell has got some property adjacent to it, but I mean, I guess how come that paperwork from that past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5791)|
| 1:36:37| ended up in that packet there and that's really not anything that's relevant to this current property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5797)|
| 1:36:42| During the process, we had to go through and get a certificate of appropriateness for the TCDA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| and part of that conversation was whether or not this was consistent with other densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| and other developments in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| And also, you know, it demonstrates that ultimately it might not be built out of the three dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5816)|
| 1:37:03| just like that property that adjacent to the south, the Hayden Hill development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| was approved at three dwelling units an acre but ultimately was built out at 1.96, I believe, is what the actual density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5828)|
| 1:37:15| It just shows that you can improve the overall density to allow the flexibility to allow it to be more marketable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5835)|
| 1:37:22| and be consistent with what is there in the area itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| So I wasn't trying to project that that was a potential buyer for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| Okay, yeah, I just knew Mr. Campbell had a property adjacent to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| which is actually old Dr. Campbell's old farm from way back in the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| I guess when he passed, Mr. Current Campbell must have inherited it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| So anywho, that kind of helps clarify my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| Is there any additional follow-up questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| That motion is promptly before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| It's been first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=5877)|

| 1:43:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6190)|

| 1:43:12| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| Yeah, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| Yeah, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6197)|
| 1:43:18| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Go ahead, Mr. Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| I hate to prolong the meeting, but Mr. Sanderson's item, primos, it was 5F20RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6200)|
| 1:43:31| We do this from time to time when you have a motion to approve something that doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6211)|
| 1:43:36| carry enough votes, sometimes we'll quickly move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| The courts have instructed us that when you make a motion, it needs to carry a majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| of the commission to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6225)|
| 1:43:47| Well, in that case, we had a motion to approve that didn't receive the sufficient votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6227)|
| 1:43:54| That item is still in front of you for action, and you should continue to make motions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6234)|
| 1:43:59| take votes until a motion and a second carries six votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| It didn't pass, so we need to have an official make a motion for something that either passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6245)|
| 1:44:11| or doesn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6251)|
| 1:44:12| That was a motion in the affirmative that did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| So we need to have a motion pass to move forward from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6256)|
| 1:44:20| Thank you for that clarification, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6263)|
| 1:44:24| So we can entertain an additional motion on this one, because nothing happened, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| on this one, so we need to go back and tidy it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| And Chairman, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6271)|
| 1:44:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6273)|
| 1:44:34| I guess the other recommendation...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| You've got the option to withdraw, probably, right now, since it's still in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| Yeah, well, it's going to get zoned one way or the other, and I know there's a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| from staff at 3.75, and if that's what the commission wants to zone it, so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| But those six units, seven units, whatever ends up being lost, that's the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6290)|
| 1:44:56| the streetlights, the parking, any amenities or any money we put into Patriot's Way or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6296)|
| 1:45:01| North Hampton Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6301)|
| 1:45:03| We will have no incentive to participate with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6303)|
| 1:45:08| We'll just do our normal, come off West Emory and tie into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6308)|
| 1:45:13| Or, if the traffic impact study makes us tie into Patriot's Way anyways, which is a boulevard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| entrance, and a boulevard entrance can house, from Knox County's math, 150 units on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6319)|
| 1:45:26| with only one entrance, a boulevard entrance, and they only have 24 on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| I have a feeling when we get our concept, staff's going to say, you've got to tie into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| Patriot's Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| So, when they make that recommendation and force us to tie into Patriot's Way, we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| to be able to go with sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| We want to improve the amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| With the lesser zoning, we're not going to have any incentive to do so, and we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| going to tie into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| They're not going to be happy, we're not going to be happy, and Knox County's not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| be happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Okay, one thing I'd like this body to consider on this particular item would be, I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6353)|
| 1:45:59| the residents have already left, I think, but I'd personally, Josh, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6359)|
| 1:46:05| I'd like to see this one move forward to next month so that the residents who were here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| earlier, I don't want it to create any perception that this came back up after we had had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| vote that they perceived that it was concluded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6374)|
| 1:46:18| One way or the other, something will happen on this one, so I would rather have this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6378)|
| 1:46:24| pushed forward to next month to have another vote on it than to feel like we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6384)|
| 1:46:30| to rush through a vote one way or another after some of the residents who were speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| up against this had came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| Yes, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| Yeah, I think this requires a little bit more thought through and discussion and engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| with both homeowners, our engineering, public works staff, and this is a much bigger discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| so I'd like to make a motion to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6415)|
| 1:46:56| 30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6416)|
| 1:46:57| 60 or 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| That's it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| His motion is to postpone for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Yeah, I think we're going to be right back here in just a matter of weeks, and I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6424)|
| 1:47:10| think this gives an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| I mean, look, you all have developed lots of stuff in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| This gives an opportunity to sit down, really engage with the homeowners, which you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6436)|
| 1:47:21| you have, but they say you haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6441)|
| 1:47:23| I think engineering and public works, TDOT, I think there's other opportunities, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| just think getting right back here in July is not going to help solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6447)|
| 1:47:31| Just for the record, you just approved 750 units on a piece of land with no traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6451)|
| 1:47:39| You all didn't talk about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6459)|
| 1:47:42| And now I've got 96 lots we're trying to put in, and the 750 lots, you all didn't talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6468)|
| 1:47:49| You made the second motion, and now you want to postpone me 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| I'm willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| That is fair to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| They walked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| I was walking out until the law director stopped me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6475)|
| 1:48:00| 30 days in here next month is, I agree, but you all just approved 750 units with no conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6480)|
| 1:48:08| and we're talking about 96 on a developer that you know we're going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6488)|
| 1:48:14| That's my response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| I made the motion, so if somebody wants to do a substitute motion, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6497)|
| 1:48:21| But there hasn't been a second yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| I'm sorry, there hasn't been a second to your motion yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| Is there a second to your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| Okay, that motion dies for lack of a second unless I'm saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| Okay, Commissioner Beeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| I was just going to ask Josh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| I was going to ask Josh, are you requesting a 30-day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6520)|
| 1:48:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6522)|
| 1:48:43| I move for a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6523)|
| 1:48:45| Okay, we have a motion from Commissioner Beeler for a 30-day with a second by Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| All right, that is what is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| Okay, looking around at Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| All right, any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| Yes, Commissioner Gill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Yes, and this is just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| I think I can appreciate if you want a 30-day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| but there are a lot of information that commissioners get, and the information is vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| so we don't make blind ñ I don't make blind decisions without actually reading the level of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| that is attached to every file in this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| So I can appreciate that observation, and I think because the opposition had left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| this is an opportunity to make sure we're all on the same page at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6567)|
| 1:49:32| All right, that seems fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| All right, Commissioner Smith and Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| All right, Commissioner Daly, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| 30 days is enough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| We've discussed this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| We are not going to know where the road comes in until there is a traffic study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| So Josh can meet with the neighborhood, but he's not going to have any answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| He's not going to know whether it's coming up at Patriots Point Way or Emory Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6603)|
| 1:50:07| until a traffic study is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6607)|
| 1:50:09| So 30 days is enough time to come back and have the residents ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| and I agree to have the residents come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6614)|
| 1:50:17| and then this is about density is what this is going to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6621)|
| 1:50:22| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| And back to you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6623)|
| 1:50:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6625)|
| 1:50:26| I was just going to go back to something you said about the previous zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6626)|
| 1:50:29| We did it at 10 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| I was kind of shocked by that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| because I think we all assume that it's assisted living at 10 units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| It's going to have very low influence in traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| but now that it's zoned, somebody wants to put apartments on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| All right, that motion is probably before us for a 30-day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| Opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| Is there any additional items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6658)|
| 1:51:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6660)|
| 1:51:01| All right, any announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6661)|
| 1:51:05| Yes, Commissioner Garrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| I'll leave you with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6669)|
| 1:51:10| Commissioner Anders said something about foresight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| I remember it made me think of something my grandfather said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| If we had the foresight that we have, the hindsight, we'd know a damn sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| I'll leave it at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| That's a great line, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| Good luck to you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| Mr. Carringer has an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| Well, I just wanted to ask my colleagues to pray for my daughter-in-law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| and son who are expecting our first grandson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| He's due August 8th, but she has been admitted to UT yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| until they have to take the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| So God is good, and I know God is in control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| but I appreciate prayers that everything will be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-200622-zoning?start=6714)|
