| 0:09:38| Is this going to be new funds we have to come up with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| The last Ã±I think it was the last meeting we had let you all Ã±you all had approved a capital lease for $5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=581)|
| 0:09:55| for the purchase of and the renovation of this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| assuming that the state does not provide some funding to that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| So it was up to $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| So that's where this would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=606)|
| 0:10:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| That's where it's covered from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| Go ahead, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| When will you know if the state will participate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=618)|
| 0:10:20| And do you think, can we make this break even without the state, or will we be in a negative position?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=620)|
| 0:10:28| So what will happen is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| I know that the mayor has been in constant contact with the governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=630)|
| 0:10:34| and they're having dialogue about whether the state's going to put their portion in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| So we'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| We will proceed as if maybe they're not, just to be safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=642)|
| 0:10:46| And we have to get our capital note approved by the state comptroller's office anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=646)|
| 0:10:51| And so we can't still break even without it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| We'll just Ã±what we'll have to do is build into our contracts with the other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| The piece of the capital that we're putting in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| So eventually we would have broke even on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| You have a way or a method to bill Scott or Union or Hamblin or Granger or whoever it might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=669)|
| 0:11:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| What we're doing currently is we're working with those counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| and we will keep the current contract in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=678)|
| 0:11:21| And then future years, if the state doesn't come through with the funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| then we'll have to look at some sort of mechanism to build those things in to reimburse for the capital note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| This is a professional services contract, so it's not put out for bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| I'll let Hugh Holt answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| He's the expert, not I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| While he's coming, Chris, one question, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| Have these other counties been notified of what we're doing and that we might have to bump them to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=714)|
| 0:12:01| Yeah, they've been Ã±a portion have yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| and I think the others we are in constant contact with and we're setting up meetings for this coming week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=725)|
| 0:12:14| Commissioner Hammond, this is a service that the state says that these services will not be competitively bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=734)|
| 0:12:23| They're to be negotiated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| And the reason that we selected Barbara McMurray and specifically Mike Dooley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=746)|
| 0:12:32| the vice president of Barbara McMurray, is his extensive background in health care design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=752)|
| 0:12:39| So other people were contacted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| Were other people contacted instead of negotiation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| I talked with some of our engineers and some of the people that will be working on this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| and they all recommended Mr. Dooley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| So, again, I'm trying to figure out in my own mind, we did not contact other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Only one company was given the opportunity to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=780)|
| 0:13:03| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Is that what I'm hearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| And a lot of it had to do with the timeline that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| We have less than a year to hire an architect and subsequent engineers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| and then go through a competitive bid process to hire a contractor to do the build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| and have all that completed by December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| That's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| Hey, Hugh, did you want to mention the rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| Oh, and the rate that Barbara McMurray will be charging the county is less than the state fee schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| In fact, it's less than a percent under state or more than a percent under state fee schedule for a restoration project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=818)|
| 0:13:50| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| We have a motion on the floor and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=838)|
| 0:14:00| On page 9, item number 24, amending resolution R-13-9-805,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=840)|
| 0:14:09| previously approved by the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| determining the method of disposal of property owned by Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=852)|
| 0:14:15| and locate 3106 Waterplant Road by the negotiated exchange and sale with Tracy K. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=855)|
| 0:14:22| Rufus Haynes Smith III, James Thomas Smith, and Rufus H. Smith, Jr. & Company, LLC, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=862)|
| 0:14:30| I'd like to make a motion to send this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| That recommendation is tied to the previous buy-sell-trade contract that we had on the piece of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=884)|
| 0:14:45| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| On page 11, item number 31, this is establishing a fee in the amount of $25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=889)|
| 0:14:57| for the assurance of a cremation permit for the office of the Knox County Medical Examiner, resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=897)|
| 0:15:04| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| Is that just a standard fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| I mean, I've heard all the controversy about a crematorium and Fountain City and those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| I believe this is a permit to conduct a cremation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| and I guess it's a standard fee that the pathology lab had charged prior to or a state or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=923)|
| 0:15:30| What I'm going to do is I'm going to turn this over to Jason Lay in the office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| He's been working extensively on this project in conjunction with the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=934)|
| 0:15:39| so he can probably answer all your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| Jason Lay, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| The medical examiner has to sign off on every cremation done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| So some funeral homes asked us why we are not charging this fee like other counties in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=951)|
| 0:16:00| and so we saw it as an opportunity to boost some revenue since we are encumbering some expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| by taking over this department, and it's in line with other counties, so we thought, why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=965)|
| 0:16:13| I guess that's the only service Knox County is up in, like, Fountain City area, isn't it, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| All that controversy with the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| So just one, as we know of, is there in Knox County, one cremation service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Not that that's relevant to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| My understanding is whether it be a funeral home, if you want to be cremated, they have to sign off on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=991)|
| 0:16:39| whether it be a case they're handling or if that is just the person's wishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=999)|
| 0:16:44| they have to sign off on every cremation done in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1010)|
| 0:16:51| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| So, Jason, this would be passed down then to the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| In other words, this is per incident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| If an ex-funeral home says, I've got Mrs. Jones, I want to have her cremated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1023)|
| 0:17:09| to do that from the medical examiner, and I'm sure the funeral home passes that down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| That's my understanding, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Yes, this doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| To clear this up, Ed, I think you had a question about the crematoriums in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| This doesn't specify which crematorium is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| It just has to happen in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| There's one in Knox County, which is the new one in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| But prior to that, the only one close by was in, I believe, in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| So, yeah, but this doesn't specify which one will be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| It's just something they have to sign off on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| So we're collecting a fee now for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| So even if the one in Blount County were used, we would collect the fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1073)|
| 0:17:56| If the death occurred in Knox County, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| We've got a motion on the floor in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Item number 32 is approving an agreement with the University Health Systems, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| doing business as University of Tennessee Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| whereby Knox County provides post-mortem examination services for the University of Tennessee Medical Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| Knox County will receive $70,000 per year payable in equal monthly installments of $5,833.33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1101)|
| 0:18:29| to provide said services, Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1117)|

| 0:19:37| for the conveyance of certain easements on property known as Fulton High School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| for the furtherance of the City's First Creek Greenway Project, Resolution 909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| This is the product of that veto that we had to go through last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1185)|
| 0:19:50| just due to the fact there were some legal issues about the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| It had to come into the General Fund and then be redispersed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| So I'm going to make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1197)|
| 0:20:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Chris, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1206)|
| 0:20:15| I don't have a problem with the amount that we've got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1215)|
| 0:20:17| I especially don't have a problem with it going to Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| I mean, every principal can use $14,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| What's going to be our in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| Say we sell rural high school and we get $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| Is it going to come back to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| Are we setting a precedent here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| What are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1235)|
| 0:20:37| I think it's two different issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| What will happen with rural high school is the schools will surplus that to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| and then at that point we will sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| And then from that point, the TCA code says that goes back to the General Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| and sell the county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1253)|
| 0:20:55| This was different in the sense that the property wasn't surplused to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1255)|
| 0:21:00| It was kind of like an annexation from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| and they paid the schools a certain portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| So I think what this resolution does is this brings it back to the General Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1266)|
| 0:21:11| as sale of county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| And then all this is doing is appropriating that money to the schools for Fulton High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| And so it will go to the schools as a transfer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| and then they will, I guess, somehow get that to Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| And then that's how their accounting works over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| They pay for those championship rings maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| It could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Congratulations to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Mr. Law Director, do you want to say anything on that, Wayne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1297)|
| 0:21:39| I want to just make sure that stuff in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| Yeah, this is really it was pulled off for a procedural thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| When you sell county property that's titled to the county, it has to go to the General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1307)|
| 0:21:53| And then the only way that money can be distributed from this body to any other body within Knox County is through appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1313)|
| 0:22:01| So this is the act of appropriating the money that was, I think, kind of talked about in the original sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1321)|
| 0:22:07| So it's just a technical thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1333)|

| 0:22:21| Page 13, item number 36,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1341)|
| 0:22:24| approving an agreement with Marble Alley Development, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| for the sale and purchase of 13 parcels collectively known as the State Street property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1347)|
| 0:22:32| which agreements provide for the purchase of up to 13 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| With those parcels not purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| remaining is an option to purchase through December 31, 2018, Resolution 910.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1358)|
| 0:22:48| We've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1372)|
| 0:22:53| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Law Director, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Yeah, we do have a slide amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| Instead of 2018, it would be 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1378)|
| 0:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| There's a maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Who's the maker of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| Commissioner Boyles and Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1387)|
| 0:23:08| Do you all agree with the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| So it will pass as amended to 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Does anybody have any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1394)|
| 0:23:16| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| Buzz is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Buzz, would you mind speaking to it and just catch us up a bit on the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1399)|
| 0:23:29| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Buzz Goss, 110 West Summit Hill Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| Commissioner Norman, thanks for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| Where we stand right now is our architects are expected to have their documents finished this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| so that we can submit them to the city for permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| And once we get that permit, then we can take that back to our lending institution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| and all the other folks involved in getting this deal under construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| And we expect right now to close on the acquisition of the first eight parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1432)|
| 0:23:58| which were recently converted into one lot by MPC mid-February, I think is the date of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| And then construction will start immediately, and we expect that to take us late into 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| which is why I came back and asked if you could give me a couple extra years on the remaining acre and a quarter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1452)|
| 0:24:17| because I can't get anything done until I'm finished with this construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1457)|
| 0:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Describe the construction in the first phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| I guess I neglected to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| This first phase is approximately 240 new residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| We had been asked by the Downtown Design Review Board to try to make some retail happen on the lower levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| and I've stepped out towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| In fact, I'm engaging Oliver Smith to help me market those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| but I can't guarantee I can get any retailers to sign leases until I'm done, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| But in addition to the 240 plus or minus lofts, we'll be building our own parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| which this board and the IBD have helped us with of 350 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Part of what we did when we converted the entire eight parcels into one parcel is we gave some right-of-way to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| in hopes that they would go in and do their street improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| The sidewalks down there are deplorable at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| But the reason to give them that right-of-way is so that they can also do some additional on-street parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| which would help the entire neighborhood of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| And I believe that current number of spaces we're projecting are 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| All of this is new construction that you're talking about in the first phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| This entire Marble Alley project will be new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| One quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| So, Buzz, when will you be breaking ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1546)|
| 0:25:48| February, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| We expect to close on the loan and acquire the property in February and as soon as possible thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1550)|
| 0:25:55| And when will I lose my recycling center down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| You'll never lose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1559)|
| 0:26:00| It'll just have to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| The city, I've been after them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| I think they're going to put it over by the safety building, I believe, right there next to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| But that will, I mean, about spring you'll be breaking ground probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS131209?start=1577)|
