| 0:04:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Yeah, it's good to see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Man, what a crew we got here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=274)|
| 0:04:37| It's so funny, Kim said, can we be just kind of casual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| I'm like, well, I think you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| But...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=282)|
| 0:04:43| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| Did we already do something wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| No, you didn't do anything wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| But with that, I'll just go ahead and turn it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| If you'll just give your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=289)|
| 0:04:53| I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| That was kind of a post-show sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| So you just ruined it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Kim Bumpus, 301 South K Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| Basically, what we're here to do, and I'm going to step away from that so that it can be casual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| We are going to kind of give you a baseline understanding of what a convention and visitor's bureau is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=312)|
| 0:05:19| And ours in Knoxville just happens to be called Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| And as we all know, over the last year, we've kind of gone through a lot of transformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=323)|
| 0:05:28| And what we wanted to do is really show you kind of the team and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| And we're going to do it in kind of a different fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| And it's going to work a little bit differently than what we had intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| because we did not want to have you all have to move around and do a lot of crazy activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| So we're going to do all the activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=347)|
| 0:05:49| So you're going to have to get super excited and support them as they stand up and do their show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| But they didn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=355)|
| 0:05:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| Yeah, and they're going to actually stand up and talk really loud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| So you all might want to turn all your microphones in, and that might capture them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| Or they could all, you know, like huddle up on this, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| Yeah, in about 35 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=377)|
| 0:06:19| So you've got to focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=379)|
| 0:06:20| If you pass the test, you get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| So what we're going to do is kind of a reverse speed dating opportunity, a Visit Knoxville 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=382)|
| 0:06:29| And each team is going to stand up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| and they're going to tell you a little bit about who they are and what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| And really what this is, it's not anything over the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| It is a baseline understanding of what the depth of a convention and visitors bureau is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| And I think that's important as we go forward for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Kim, I hate to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Let me interrupt you one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=414)|
| 0:06:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| You're all going to speak into the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=416)|
| 0:06:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| I guess that's, is that good now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| You think so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| All right, cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| So we want to give a baseline understanding of what a convention and visitors bureau is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| so that people can really start to understand and know why to celebrate what it is we have in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| and what tourism means, because I think that is a missed opportunity of the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| I think that everyone kind of has an idea of what they think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| but it may or may not be right in line with what exactly a convention and visitor bureau is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| what they do, and what they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| So this is actually going to even add an extra depth to our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| So they're going to kind of huddle up here and kind of go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=458)|
| 0:07:43| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| Davis, if you want to pass out the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=465)|
| 0:07:48| what we're going to give you is kind of a 101 guide to what they're going to be talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=468)|
| 0:07:53| They're going to introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| We're also going to give you a resource book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| Some of you already have this, but those that don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| this will give you who the board of directors and who the staff is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| And we're going to go that route, and they're going to each do it in a series of teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| in about 20 minutes apiece, and we'll pause for questions after each team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| And that's going to really focus on sales and service, marketing, and then visitor services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=492)|
| 0:08:17| And I think after that, everyone will have a baseline understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| and as we move forward, people will be able to make even better recommendations on how we can do it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=501)|
| 0:08:27| So with that, Leanna, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=507)|
| 0:08:39| We'll just take turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| We'll take turns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| And when I get done, we can just step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| That be okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=523)|
| 0:08:44| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Grab that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=525)|
| 0:08:51| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| I am Leanna Ballew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| I am senior director of sales and services at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| I have been with Visit Knoxville for about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Prior to that, I was with the Knoxville Convention Center as their director of sales and marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=540)|
| 0:09:05| In our sales and services department, we are responsible for identifying, fostering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=545)|
| 0:09:10| and actualizing conventions, trade shows, tournaments, meetings to come to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=550)|
| 0:09:19| And through that with our sales department, we achieve that by going to numerous trade shows, blitzes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=559)|
| 0:09:25| which sales blitzes are where our team goes to, say, Washington, D.C., or Atlanta, or Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=565)|
| 0:09:33| and have appointments that we make with qualified meeting planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| We also do site visits where we bring particular groups into Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| show them around specifics of what would cater to their group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| We also do familiarization tours, which I think some of you have been involved with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| biscuit making over at the convention center before, or some of the other activities that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=592)|
| 0:09:58| The fam tour is where we bring a group of meeting planners to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| and just kind of wow them with what we have to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=604)|
| 0:10:07| They usually come in, it's usually about a day and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| and they'll come in and we'll take them to the hotels, to the attractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| and just show them how great it is to be in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| On the other side of that, we do the services for that, for our groups that come in, which involves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| and I'm going to let them each tell you kind of what is involved with what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=622)|
| 0:10:26| but that is where we provide pretty much anything once they get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| We're their meeting planner once they get here, a local contact for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| for visitor's guides, or most anything they need once they get to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| And with that, I would like to start with Jennifer and let them each introduce themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| Good afternoon, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Can you hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=650)|
| 0:10:51| Good, excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| My name is Jennifer Morris, and I am the Director of Sports Sales for Visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=652)|
| 0:10:57| which is a great, fun job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| I've been with Visit Knoxville for about four and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| and prior to that was with the Knoxville Convention Center in sales for five and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| Enjoy this job so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| We have a great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| We have a great sports community and a great team to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| Some of the things that I do on a daily basis are sales calls to various national governing bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=678)|
| 0:11:25| as well as bid packages and just determining what type of sports events are good fits for our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=685)|
| 0:11:33| Some neat things that I've been doing lately, I was able to take a trip to Indianapolis early winter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| to go visit with some of the national governing bodies that are in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| USA Diving, USA Track and Field, and USA Gymnastics are all in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| so it was a great opportunity to go there, meet with all of them at various times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| and sort of learn even more about how our needs can fit with each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| I was able to attend in January the NCAA trade show where I got to meet with numerous championship directors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| of all the various division sports there as well as another one coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| which is the National Association of Sports Commissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| where we have one-on-one appointments with various event organizers and planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=732)|
| 0:12:18| where we have an opportunity to take about seven to eight minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| and figure out if our cities are good fits for their events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=741)|
| 0:12:27| Probably my favorite part about the job is being able to bring clients into Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| and a lot of the sales directors will probably say the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| People are always so pleasantly surprised at what they see and what Knoxville has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| I've actually got one flying in tomorrow morning at 8.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| so I'm going to be with them all day tomorrow and Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| and believe they're going to be leaving here pleasantly surprised at what they see as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| So, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Hi, my name is Pearl Dorsey. I'm one of the sales directors at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=776)|
| 0:13:01| I've been there two years. I'm a native of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Prior to that, I was with Comcast for 13 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| and some of my markets, just to touch base on some of my markets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| I have the corporate, government, and the state association market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=790)|
| 0:13:15| and I do sales blitzes around the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=795)|
| 0:13:18| I was in Chattanooga last month making sales calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| and I'll be in Nashville next week making sales calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| trying to maintain the business relationships so that we can remain in the rotation for the state meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=804)|
| 0:13:33| In June, I'll be going to collaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| Like Jennifer mentioned, we attend trade shows where it's like reverse speed dating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| We meet with the planners to just see if they have business for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=820)|
| 0:13:47| My favorite part about the job, like Jennifer said, I love bringing people into Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| because they get here and it's like, oh, I didn't know Knoxville had that to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=831)|
| 0:13:56| But I enjoy my teammates, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=836)|
| 0:14:03| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=843)|
| 0:14:05| My name is Tammy Ivey, and I am actually the newest member of the Visit Knoxville team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| and I'm definitely not new to sales and hospitality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| I come from my prior position was with the Holiday Inn and the Hampton Inn at Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| and have over 30 years in sales and hospitality experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| But I think the one thing that I love most about my job now is being able to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=864)|
| 0:14:31| all the hotels in Knoxville and their sales team and just to be an addition to their sales team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=871)|
| 0:14:36| and also just to represent this beautiful city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| The markets that I'm responsible for are pretty much your social markets and social and motor coach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=880)|
| 0:14:49| known as the Smurf market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| One of the things that has been my fondest memory so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| we did a fan recently in April, and we had a lady that was visiting from L.A.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| and she mentioned when she got here, she said, people have bugged me and bugged me about coming to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=904)|
| 0:15:10| and I finally am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| And she said, I thought I was going to come in and say thank you, but no thank you, and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| And she said, but I am completely overwhelmed with this city and all that it has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| And just with her, there's huge potential of national and regional events for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| So just being able to experience that with a team and the success that we were able to show her with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=930)|
| 0:15:38| and to have somebody love it as much as I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| So glad to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=940)|
| 0:15:46| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| My name is Christy Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| I've been with Visit Knoxville for almost two years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| and prior to my CBB experience, I have 14 years of hotel experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| Totally get the heads and beds philosophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and of course my main goal is to bring conventions to Knoxville and fill our hotels and convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=962)|
| 0:16:08| Some of the ways that we do that, I just got back from a large convention in Las Vegas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=968)|
| 0:16:16| and we have one-on-one appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| And I met with 28 meeting planners that all have, hopefully, potential business for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=978)|
| 0:16:25| I did receive three, hopefully I've got two more on the way, RFPs coming back from that convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=985)|
| 0:16:33| We do travel a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| I'm getting ready to travel to another similar convention in Orlando.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| It's called Helms Briscoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Helms Briscoe is a third-party company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1000)|
| 0:16:43| It's all meeting planners, and it's the same setup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| We'll have one-on-one appointments, and I'll have the opportunity to talk with them for five minutes each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| and to let them know what Knoxville has to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| And I always try to find out, like, what can we tell you about Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| And sometimes they'll say, we just want to hear your southern accent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| It's obvious I'm from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| I've always lived in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| Very passionate about this area and love it with all my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| And my goal is to sell it the best of my ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| And my markets are, my main markets, which is the bulk of my business, is the scientific market and the hobby market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1039)|
| 0:17:27| Two extreme markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| So we work with scientists on one end and chicken farmers on the other end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| I love them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| Now I'm going to turn it over to services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1057)|
| 0:17:42| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| I'm Kelly Gibson, and I am Director of Event Operations at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| And I have been with the company now for a little over six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| As Christy said, I am in our services department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Christina and I work very closely and kind of divide up the groups that are coming into Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| We, again, are part of the sales team and we kind of see ourselves as an extension of the sales team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| We work very closely with all of our sales directors in looking at, when they are looking at groups, trying to bring them to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1087)|
| 0:18:15| we kind of say that we're the realist and we kind of look at all the things that they need and say, oh, yes, we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1095)|
| 0:18:21| And we're the ones who kind of look at the numbers and just make sure that things are doable and we provide ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| You know, this group may be a great match for this attraction or we can do different fun activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| And then, again, once the group says, yes, we're choosing Knoxville, we're coming, we work with them and are basically their local event planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1114)|
| 0:18:43| As you all know, most of these planners are from other cities and are not familiar with who they should call for bus providers or a caterer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1123)|
| 0:18:53| or if they want to do an off-site function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| So we're here to help them, give them ideas, again, work closely with all of our attractions and our partners to give them opportunities to have groups come to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1136)|
| 0:19:07| Just really anything and everything that the planner may need to put on their event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| We have lots of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| We're going into our, we're busy all year long, but we're going into our really busy season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| And, you know, we also, as I said, an extension of the sales team, we know that if we're doing our job, then they will want to come back to Knoxville for future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1160)|
| 0:19:30| So we're here just to make it a great experience for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| And hopefully they will see what Knoxville has to offer and want to come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| And I'm going to turn it over to Christina and let her tell you a little bit about what she does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| Hi, my name is Christina Clayton, and I am the Client Services Manager at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| Kelly kind of covered what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| We kind of divide up the groups, and I usually work, well, actually, I work with all four of the directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1192)|
| 0:19:59| Just got back from a pre-promote in South Carolina for Professional Outdoor Media Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| They're going to be a really great group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| They're going to bring over a million dollars in editorials, outdoor editorials for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| So I think that that's going to be a really great event that I've been working really hard on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| But basically, Kelly covered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| No, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I just work with her in services, and I'm going to turn it over to Rachel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Good evening, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1228)|
| 0:20:30| How are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| All right, stretch it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Okay, so I am Rachel Ellis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| I am the Community Partnership Director here at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| I have been with the company for seven years, born and raised, and I know a lot of your faces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| and I'm so glad to see you this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| I have the pleasure of working with our volunteers, which is a part of Team Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| which is our volunteer corps here with the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| We have a little over 3,000 volunteers, and we do have about 100 who are fairly active.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| Obviously, our volunteers are very interested in what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Obviously, our volunteers are very interested in sports events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| and all these lovely ladies, they bring in so many different events that need volunteers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| They do everything from registration to Knoxville information booths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| to help guide them to the proper restaurants or activities that they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| They also take care of things like checking credentials and all kinds of good, fun stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| So we would welcome anybody who would like to be a volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1281)|
| 0:21:25| I know Mr. Greve over here has a lovely wife who's a wonderful volunteer of ours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| and we are greatly appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1289)|
| 0:21:32| I also have the opportunity to work with our local and national companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| to raise funds for Boomsday, which, P.S., is 156 days away, so get excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| So Boomsday is obviously a large part of what we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| and I take care of, along with our team, everything from logistics to food vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1307)|
| 0:21:54| again, sponsors and all the things that come with bringing sponsors into town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| being creative and coming up with ideas and working with the vice mayor on some ideas with South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| and just really having a good time and being creative with our 26th year of Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1324)|
| 0:22:09| I also have the opportunity to raise funds and work with our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| on some of the different sporting events that come in town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| or any other events that the ladies bring in that might need some help on their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| So do you guys have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| Sure. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1346)|
| 0:22:31| Well, that is really the biggest department that we have, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| so you don't have to sit through quite that many again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1356)|
| 0:22:39| but they are the awesome department of sales and service, and they do a lot, as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| and we're packing it in more in small, digestible ways in which you can receive the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1364)|
| 0:22:51| That's why they're dividing it up and just kind of telling it to you from their own perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| Obviously, very unscripted, so that's a good thing because that makes it more exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| So thank you all very much. We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| And if you have any questions about sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1383)|
| 0:23:06| How do you all want to do this? Do you want to ask questions per group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| I just want to find out why no men made the cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| We're saving those for the next round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| I would say one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| I forget who did the motor coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| If you're not in the business, you might want to just expand on that just briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| what that actually is, what that market is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| Oh, calling on groups that come in, obviously, on chartered buses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| whether helping them find ideas that are in Knoxville, especially like with the Civil War anniversary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1416)|
| 0:23:45| If they aren't already coming, give them ideas of why to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| And then I recently attended the Tennessee Motor Coach Association that was held here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| and then I've got plans to go to some other state associations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| and just meet with the motor coach owners and get them in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| Wow, crazy seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| Seniors, youth, students. There's a lot of student tours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| What that really benefits is a lot of our festivals and the different things that we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| Dogwood is a big attractor to the motor coach market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| Back in the day, we used to have tons and tons of motor coaches that would come in and drive the trails and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| Now, a lot of things have shifted over the years, and maybe that's not exactly what we want to happen anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| but we do want those motor coaches to come to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And Tammy does a really great job, and she's brand new to the team, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| so she's kind of learning about it as she's jumping into it because she does come from an extensive hotel background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| Are there any other questions on sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| I know that's a lot of information, and it basically covers the trade shows we go to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1490)|
| 0:24:55| the site visits that we bring to town, all of the different things that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| The FAMS, I think that they touched on, which is where we bring a bunch of meeting planners together all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| But, you know, it's a really deep activity because it's like a turnkey opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| You know, we're booking the group, but then you have to kind of service the group when it gets here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| and that's where the whole team kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1518)|
| 0:25:20| Kim, let me ask you, is there a buzz about the Civil War celebration that's coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| I mean, is that going to be a big, potentially a big win for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| The sesquicentennial activities, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yes, I've learned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| I actually never could say it until about a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| Sesquicentennial, if you want me to teach you all how to say that, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I learned how to say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| It is a commemoration, but it is going to be a really big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| and we will be actually announcing some of those events over the next month or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| We're really just now working in partnership with the group that's putting those activities together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| But, yeah, it's going to be a big deal, and the signature event for that will be in 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| and that will be Knoxville's opportunity to host their state sesquicentennial event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| whereas some of our other partners have already hosted theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| I worked with two of those ladies who will go unnamed, and thanks for no Nick stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| Well, they actually wanted to work those in, but I pulled those back, so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| So we will go to the marketing department now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| They will come up, and here's where you'll meet some of our male employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1590)|
| 0:26:41| Well, hello, hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| I'm Kim Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| I'm the senior director of marketing communications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| I know a bunch of your faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| I work with you pretty much on a weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| The marketing team for Visit Knoxville is almost just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| We really just kind of market Knoxville to be a premier destination for leisure and meeting groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1613)|
| 0:26:58| We kind of focus on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Kind of three pillars that we really focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| One of those ways that we market grassroots-wise is with media relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1622)|
| 0:27:08| We work very, very closely with our local, our regional, and our national media to get coverage on Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1628)|
| 0:27:15| to get that PR story, to get the stories in the magazines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| That can be everything from a southern living to a meeting convention south type magazine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| We're constantly talking about trying to figure out what different journalists want, what editors want, different things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| One of the things that we do on a pretty normal basis that Kathryn and I just finished last week was we go on media blitzes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1651)|
| 0:27:38| We go to different areas, kind of like our target cities, and we talk to newspapers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| We talk to magazine editors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| We talk to freelance writers about either visiting Knoxville or writing about Knoxville, things that we have going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1665)|
| 0:27:51| We can talk about everything from our urban wilderness to all the arts going on to festivals like Dogwood Art, Biscuit Festival,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1671)|
| 0:27:59| Boomsday, Christmas in the City, Festival on the Fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| These are things that they're writing that folks can read about and they can come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Last week I was in Lexington, Cincinnati, and Columbus, Ohio, talking to about 20 different editors and different things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| and probably secured about six or seven stories and working on about four or five others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Those are just really good mentions for us as a city about why people want to travel here and what they can do and different things on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| We also are very big into bringing those writers here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| We also, like CELS, we also do FAMS, where we bring a group of meeting planners together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| We have one coming up at the end of April, but we're going to highlight two things, Dogwood Arts and the Rosini Festival| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| and everything that's going on with our unique culinary and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1717)|
| 0:28:41| These folks go back, and a lot of times if you're looking through some of your magazines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| like a Garden and Gun or a Southern Living or a Smoky Mountain Living that comes out of Asheville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| and you see a story on Knoxville, a lot of times that's come somehow usually through our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| They'll call and we'll either work with those writers and bring them here or send photographs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| We have a lot of different things that we do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| Another big area that we're going to go on, that Catherine's going to go on, is communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| We really look at how we communicate to the visitor, to the potential visitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| and also to locals. How do we tell locals what's going on in our town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| Our website is a big part of that. Our app is a big part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Councilman De La Boca worked very closely with Catherine and I, our entire team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1758)|
| 0:29:22| to kind of drive that process of launching the Visit Knoxville app.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1762)|
| 0:29:27| If you haven't got it, go to your app store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| If you have a smartphone for Android or iPhones, download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| My favorite part on there is something called What's Happening Now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Find out what's going on. If you're like, what's going on this weekend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| Or you have a constituent that says, hey, I want to know what's going on downtown or in North Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| however it is, then you can kind of just drive them to that app and it has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1785)|
| 0:29:49| My favorite story about that we were laughing about as we were putting it together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| was we couldn't figure out why in the world, when we had the app loading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| that there was only two days of events happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| We're like, we know we have more than two days of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| It was loading maybe 100 things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| And so we were talking to our app developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| They said, well, you realize that you're only loading, we've got it set right now to only 100 events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| Let's put it at 1,000 or 2,000 and see if we can maybe get a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1811)|
| 0:30:16| We have a lot going on in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| And so it's just kind of really neat that you can kind of go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| We also are really big on a lot of our other communications things like our visitor guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1821)|
| 0:30:26| and our meeting planner guides and kind of seeing those things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| And then one of the other big things that we oversee is the marketing plan for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| And also the convention center and really promoting conventions that are on groups to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| I'm going to go ahead and turn it on over to my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1838)|
| 0:30:40| And they're going to kind of tell you a little bit what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| Hi, guys. My name is Catherine Saxon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| I'm the communications manager at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| I've actually been with the company about six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| I used to work down in the visitor center all throughout college in the cafe and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| So I've had kind of the firsthand experience with the leisure travelers who come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| As Kim mentioned, I do a lot with the communications, you know, working very closely with local, regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1861)|
| 0:31:07| and national media with the different things she spoke about, the media blitzes, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1867)|
| 0:31:13| if somebody needs an interview, information for a story, stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| I'm very excited about the upcoming FAM that we're going to be having in April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And then, you know, along with the communications, I've kind of rolled my old position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| into one with this new communications manager position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| I'm also in charge of our website and our social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1890)|
| 0:31:34| So when you are on our website, actually there's three platforms really that I wanted to tell you all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| It's our website, our mobile website, and then obviously the app we spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| So one really unique thing about that is, say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| one of you all noticed that there's something that needed to be updated for a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| I can easily go into the back end of our system, make that update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1913)|
| 0:31:57| and it will update it throughout all of our platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| So it's very, you know, efficient, get in there, get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| Yes, one and done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| So that's a great tool that we have, you know, got a lot of exciting things coming up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| with keeping on with the app, getting some more stuff with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| And then obviously our social media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| We do have our Facebook page, facebook.com backslash visit Knoxville TN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1942)|
| 0:32:27| We now have over 20,000 followers on that and are very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| We still have our Twitter account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| We have Vimeo accounts where we have our videos, and Brent's going to go more into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1955)|
| 0:32:41| and a YouTube account, and Pinterest is becoming very popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| so highlighting some of the scenic pictures that we have of our area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| So that's mostly kind of an all-encompassing look at what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| So thank you all so much, and I'm going to hand it over to Brent now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| I'm excited to be part of the manliest department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| No offense, Ed, but we are the manliest here, half of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| My name is Brent Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| I am the community outreach manager on the marketing team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1991)|
| 0:33:14| I'm originally from Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Spent most of my time in my career in the restaurant business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| and I got my start back with Bill Regas, Sobert Regas, in the late 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| and learned a lot from him in terms of what hospitality truly means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| So I'm very excited for what my job, what that means for my job here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2007)|
| 0:33:31| I'm working on two pretty large projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| The first is called the Community Outreach Stakeholder Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| and if you want to shorten that, it's called COSI, and I didn't plan that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| It just happened to work out that way, but it actually means something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| I'm getting ready to start a tour, more or less, of our tourism stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2027)|
| 0:33:55| This is a reconnect after the last year of what this group's been through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| and the changing of our whole organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| We felt like it was very important to go and reconnect with our tourism stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| who are in our city to rebuild relationships and to do kind of what we're doing here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| letting them know what it is that we are doing to help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| but also learning their business, their strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities and threats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| We're in the process of sending out a survey, a 46-question survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| that really dives down into all the details of their business that will help us study them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2066)|
| 0:34:32| and what will work best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| So we want to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| We want to make sure that they have all the resources they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| so when it comes down to them telling their own folks, their own customers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| their own patrons what to do in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| we want to be able to answer that question for them very, very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| We're going to go a step further, though, in these relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2087)|
| 0:34:50| and create sizzle videos for some of our properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| These will be 60-second videos that sell quickly and to the point that particular space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2094)|
| 0:35:02| So that's very helpful for our sales department as well as just our general leisure traveler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| when they're able to understand quickly something about a hotel, an attraction, an event, any of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| So we're creating a lot of video content for our properties coming up very soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| So that's the cozy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Another project that I'm very passionate about and very excited to be a part of is the Knoxville Mural Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| I'm an artist. I'm a musician here in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| I'm very, very passionate about Knoxville as an arts destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| And so this project really speaks to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2133)|
| 0:35:35| Working with members of the city and county, the Public Art Committee, the Central Business Improvement District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2135)|
| 0:35:42| we are moving forward with creating a mural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And we're starting with our building, the Visit Knoxville building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| And we're moving forward to create a process through which we can beautify the rest of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| and keep moving along with creating more murals that hopefully will bring people to Knoxville to see what it is that we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| Create a nice self-guided walking tour that people can look at their smart phones and see what piece they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2162)|
| 0:36:07| Walk throughout the city to see the murals that hopefully we'll get a chance to put up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2167)|
| 0:36:13| and embrace our artistic everything that we have to offer here, which is so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| So I'm at a great place, and I love what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| So thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| And this is the other guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| My name is Brad Keaton, and I'm a new addition to Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| I've been with Visit Knoxville almost three months now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| I'm the creative director, which means I get to have all the fun and create really fun flyers, posters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| I work very closely with the sales team for the people they bring in to do, like, books that has, like, a snapshot of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2205)|
| 0:36:54| It's an overall guide that we hand out to everybody to let everybody know what we have here and what we offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| And some of the really fun things to do here in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| Another thing I do is, of course, I make the posters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| I recently completed for the Shriners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| They're going to be coming in for a convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| It's a little pocket map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2230)|
| 0:37:12| Basically, it's just the size of a card, and what you can do is it just expands into a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| It has a map of Knoxville, and it also has, like, all the cool things that you can do and all their phone numbers and locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2237)|
| 0:37:23| So it's just kind of a quick reference guide for them to help them enjoy their visit while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| I recently also completed some posters for Rhythm and Bloom's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| So if you're out and about and you see some signs near the trolley, I worked on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| So I basically work close to a lot of local attractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| Recently, I completed a Ramsey House rack card to be displayed in our visitor center, as well as the Coomba Festival rack card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2262)|
| 0:37:51| So anything creative that comes through the pipeline, that's what I work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2271)|
| 0:37:55| I try to make it as much fun as possible to really sell our fine city and just kind of make it creative and have a good time with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2275)|
| 0:38:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| One question on the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Is it just downtown, or is it all the quadrants of the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| It goes around the downtown portion, and it kind of spreads out a little bit further, but it's mainly in the downtown region for a while they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2294)|
| 0:38:23| The Metropulse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| The center map with activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| Well, it's a little bit different than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| It's the same concept, but it folds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| It's kind of like we're talking about the Z-card map, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| It basically folds up, and it goes in their pocket, and then they can pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| And it's geared more to the conventioneer who's, you know, obviously either meeting at one of our downtown properties or the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2320)|
| 0:38:48| So it does have some sort of a downtown-centric focus, but as we move forward with a Z-card map and that vision, I think you'll see that branch into the other areas of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2328)|
| 0:38:59| Because right for this one, it was birthed out of a conversation with the Shriners that are meeting downtown, and then it kind of built from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2339)|
| 0:39:08| So it's really of our first run at a map like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| But, yeah, I think that's another opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| The hip pocket kind of thing you bring with the hotel desk or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| Yeah, and actually for them, I think it even has some activities in their schedule on the flip side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| So, I mean, it's a really neat thing that we could look at doing for other conventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| As far as it being overall practical for just that random leisure traveler, we don't know that it really is applicable there yet, but we're, you know, this is our first run at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2367)|
| 0:39:38| Are there any other questions as it relates to marketing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2378)|
| 0:39:43| I mean, marketing can get a lot deeper than where they went tonight, but that's kind of an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2383)|
| 0:39:50| We're just excited to soon see the sizzle video on city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| Really troll them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| We're going to film that here in about a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| Is everybody ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| We got some music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| So, any other questions there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| Are you trying to sell top skills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| It's a highly competitive thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| What's the edge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| Who are you talking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| What group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| What do you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| If you're talking about an edge, if you bring their convention, you know, competing with them, is there one particular thing that stands out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2428)|
| 0:40:38| Well, there's quite a few, and you can kind of tear that, and that means if you're on paper or they're actually standing right here in front of us doing a site visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2438)|
| 0:40:47| And on paper, Knoxville really speaks to people because of its regional location, its drivability, and its economical rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2447)|
| 0:40:56| That speaks to a lot of conventioneers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| But then when you go past that, when we get them here for a site visit, our closure rate is off the charts because of the friendliness of everyone in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2459)|
| 0:41:08| And, I mean, I know that sounds kind of crazy, but it is one of the biggest feedbacks we get from fans and site visits is literally when people are not from Knoxville and they're walking around Knoxville, Knoxvillians are some of the most genuine, nice people that they have ever met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2468)|
| 0:41:26| And I think that's going to go a really long way, especially when we step into the next phase of our promotion as a destination and we start talking to that leisure traveler about why Knoxville is a great weekend destination or a great extended stay destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2486)|
| 0:41:41| Hey, you're coming here for a convention, bring your family, and here's a reason why you stay an extra three days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| And it also lends to the repeat customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I mean, we've got a couple of events that have been coming here for 25 plus years, and a lot of that has to do with, yes, Knoxville is a great place to do business because they can find rates that meets their budgetary needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2510)|
| 0:42:02| But it's really the friendliness and the service that they get here and the sense of family and the sense of team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| And you don't get that everywhere you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I mean, our team travels a lot, and you just do, you honestly don't get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| So Knoxville has a real treasure in that, and sometimes we take that for granted because, you know, we live here and we look past it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2536)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| I thought that was a great question, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| In terms of sort of the flip side, what do you think is the biggest hurdle when people say that they have an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| What would be that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2560)|
| 0:42:43| We have 101 properties that make up 8,000 peak rooms in 101 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2563)|
| 0:42:49| So when you talk about obstacles, that would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| So when you're talking to a citywide, and let's say we want those big pieces of business, you want that piece of business that's going to bring 15,000 people, and they need 8,000 rooms on peak night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2573)|
| 0:43:04| And when we're out there selling against other destinations that can accomplish those 8,000 rooms in 10 properties, it then makes Knoxville a little bit of a hard sell on paper when we say, oh, hey, we can do that too, but it's 101 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2584)|
| 0:43:18| Here's how that lays out, and here's how we're going to get everyone from point A to point B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2598)|
| 0:43:24| It's not an obstacle that we can't get around as we book citywides all the time, but that is a really key thing for us to all just know in our hearts because that makes them have to work just a little bit harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2604)|
| 0:43:41| And what we do is we get really creative, and we present this more as almost like an open-air mall-type feeling, like, hey, you get a variety of product, a variety of rates, a variety of different things for your attendees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2621)|
| 0:43:54| Oh, yes, they do have exposure to the elements, but we have great elements here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| Well, not lately, but it's usually pretty mild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| So we sell it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| And I think another thing is is that we don't have a property that's connected to the convention center all enclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| That has never really stopped us from booking the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| It just makes it harder for us to book the business sometimes because if you have a scientific convention, which is big money, those are great things, and we have great partners with the University of Tennessee and ORNL, and we can bring those conventions to here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2660)|
| 0:44:38| But they're used to being at the Venetian in Las Vegas where they never literally step outside of the building, and you can set the whole Venetian on our downtown, and that's the size of what they're used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2678)|
| 0:44:50| So, again, that goes back to that open-air mall pitch of, yes, you're going to be in five different properties, but this is why that benefits you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2690)|
| 0:44:59| And we've been successful in doing that, but I think if you speak to, like, what are some of the things we have to really think creatively to get around, those are some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2699)|
| 0:45:08| And we really don't take no for an answer, so, you know, we always find a way to get around the obstacle, but those are some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2708)|
| 0:45:16| That's where our service team comes in, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| That's where Kelly gets in our car, and she starts driving people around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| So thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| What are some of the larger conventions involved, like the quilters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| Quilters, some of the ones that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Obviously, we have the National Street Rod Association that's been here for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| You've got Destination Imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| How many people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Street Rod is roughly about 15,000 people, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2741)|
| 0:45:49| One thing that we do find as a challenge in today's world that maybe wasn't there, backtrack, you know, 10 years, is it is harder for us to track the actual room pickup because people stay outside the blocks these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2749)|
| 0:46:02| With all of the third-party booking engines, Travelocity, cheap tickets, people have gotten really creative on how they find the best rate for them as the traveler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2762)|
| 0:46:12| So with that, we're trying to also, through the Cozy Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you, Brent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Is educate our hotels on how to track those rooms better because I can't tell you how many times a street rod, you can drive around all of our properties, and you can literally see their parking lot is full of street rod cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2778)|
| 0:46:32| But if you walk in and you say, hey, how many rooms did street rod pick up tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Oh, well, why is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| Would you have street rods in your parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| And they say, well, there's none of them are here for street rod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| But what that is, it's not them trying to say there's no street riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| It's they don't have sometimes with 101 properties and only six of those are full service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| You have a lot of limited properties with limited mindsets and limited resources and mindsets isn't a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2815)|
| 0:47:02| It just means they only know what they've been exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| So we have to do a better job of providing education opportunities as a CBB for those properties so they can understand rate only codes and different ways to track the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2826)|
| 0:47:18| And I think that that's a missed opportunity of the past, but that's what we're working on now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| So really, right now, for street rod, we go around and we count up the rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| And luckily, you know, they're around 6000 rooms on peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| But at the end of the day, you know, with 15000 people, they're probably using more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2851)|
| 0:47:36| So that's something that we're trying to trying to get our arms around as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| Winterfest had was at 20000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| Is 18 to 20000 people destination imagination actually is having a record year this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| Christie, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Yeah, 14000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| So, you know, we have some great pieces of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| And that's another thing to think about when everybody says new business, new business, new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| One of the things that we're trying to educate people on is hanging on to the business that we have and focusing on new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2887)|
| 0:48:14| Because I can't tell you how many times we've had to run Lexington or Louisville off Chilhowee Park during street rod.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2894)|
| 0:48:23| Because they're here and they're trying to talk to Jerry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| And we're like, yo, really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| So, you know, so we have to shoo them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2908)|
| 0:48:30| And it's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| I mean, it's healthy competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| But that's where we have to hang.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| We want to hang on to the repeat business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| We value that probably as much, if not more at times, than new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2917)|
| 0:48:42| Because it's easier to hang on to what you have and then fill in the holes than it is to lose everything that you have and have to go find all new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2922)|
| 0:48:48| So we have some great pieces of business on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| And we're putting some great pieces of business on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| So is there any other questions as it relates to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| So you taser the Louisville people and put them in a van?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| Pretty much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Well, that again, well, that goes down to that's really a CC function, Christina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| Yeah, little Clayton over there, she just grabs them up and ties them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2946)|
| 0:49:10| Don't fall into his trap, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| We'll be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| So, anyway, we only have one more presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| So we all know it's the night before a holiday weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| So we save the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| And I brought props.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| We have props.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| And they're all rolling their eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| It's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| Hi, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| My name is Lainey Shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| I'm Director of Visitor Services at Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| I've been with Visit Knoxville for about six years and been in the hospitality industry for about ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| So I really enjoy what I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| I came down to Visitor Services almost three years ago to run this department and just truly love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| Visitor Services is the first impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| We are the visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| We are that first impression with each local visitor and the locals that come in our visitor center as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| We realize that word of mouth and social media are at an all-time high right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| And we know that those are our best tools to get Knoxville out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3006)|
| 0:50:10| So we want to make sure that that visitor experience is a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| And we take that job very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Our team has a huge passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| One of them is missing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| She's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| She's missing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| But we have a huge passion for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| I myself have been here for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| I was transplanted from South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| So you can't get me back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| It's truly hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| I love our four seasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| And I love to talk to visitors about that and even people who are moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| So we have a great time in the visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| And we'll tell you a little bit more about that as we go through some of the positions that we have within our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Like I said, I'm Director of Visitor Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| So what falls under my job are a couple of different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| I am the liaison with the state of Tennessee Department of Tourism for our Tennessee Trails and Byways Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| I believe quite a few of you are very familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| I saw quite a few of you at the launch of our White Lightning Trail a few years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3057)|
| 0:51:01| But Knoxville actually sits on three different trails for the Trails and Byways Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3061)|
| 0:51:08| We are the trail leader of the White Lightning Trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| And we also sit on the Rocky Top and Top Secret trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| So we're very excited about that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| If you don't know about the Trails and Byways Program, that is a program the state of Tennessee started to cover all 95 counties in the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| trying to get people off the interstates and into some of these smaller cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| We obviously capture a lot of visitors, and we love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| But we want to make sure that these visitors are grabbing some of these great places that they might not know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| You know, Pizza Palace, Litton's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Some of these great places that we all know, but we want to make sure everyone else knows about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| And that's what these guides do for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| I also, for the company, am the liaison with WDVX radio station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Obviously, they have programming in our visitor center Monday through Saturday at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| I hope you guys have been out for a Blue Plate special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| If you haven't, I would love to see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3116)|
| 0:51:58| I also run our Gotta Know Knoxville Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| This is a monthly program where we are just working to extend our reach out to people who live and work in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3121)|
| 0:52:08| And just get them educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| It's kind of a Knoxville 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| We want them to make sure that they've got the right answers when visitors ask them a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| Again, extending our reach out to so many other people here in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3136)|
| 0:52:20| I also work with tour operators and AAA agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| Where our sales department does work with tour operators for overnight stays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| I work with tour operators who are just coming through Knoxville or stopping in for the day because a lot of them do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| And they want to just come in for a couple of hours or bring in a church group from just, you know, maybe 50 miles down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3154)|
| 0:52:41| Just come in for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| And so I handle those experiences for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I also handle distribution services for our company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| Where we distribute our visitor guide and our pad maps that we take out all throughout the Knoxville metro region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| And get those into hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| And then I handle, most recently have taken over building operations last fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| So that's been very exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3184)|
| 0:53:05| I'm learning a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| I'm learning how to use my ladybug hammer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| That's a big joke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| And then finally visitor center management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| Obviously the visitor center is my baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3193)|
| 0:53:15| I love it and have a lot of passion for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3195)|
| 0:53:18| I manage our assistant manager of visitor services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| And then you'll meet Kimberly here in a moment, our visitor center associate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| And then three part-time visitor center associates that handle our business as we are open seven days a week and only closed four days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3204)|
| 0:53:31| Obviously visitors are in our city during the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| And we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| We realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3215)|
| 0:53:36| And we're here for them to make sure that they have the right experience when they come into town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3216)|
| 0:53:41| As I said, Annie White, who is our assistant manager of visitor services, is not with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| She had some surgery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3226)|
| 0:53:47| So she's back home taking care of herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| But her responsibilities include visitor inquiry fulfillment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| Which means when someone calls in and asks for a visitor guide, we want to make sure we get that out to them immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| And any other things that they might be specifically interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| I too can say sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| A lot of people are coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| You like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3247)|
| 0:54:08| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3248)|
| 0:54:09| Sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| We can do that a couple times if you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| So we're having a huge influx of visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Very excited about the sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| And all of the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| I'm just going to keep doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| All about the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| And so we have some great driving trails and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| Different brochures in the visitor center that we can provide to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| So we make sure to get that information out to them in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| She handles brochure inventory and distribution in our visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Where you will have, you know, most visitor centers are just brochure racks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| We are so much more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3275)|
| 0:54:37| But we have to have the brochure racks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| And we love those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3278)|
| 0:54:39| People like to have things in their hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| And they come in and they get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3281)|
| 0:54:42| And get these great experiences that Kimberly will talk to you about in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| She also handles our ride-along program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3286)|
| 0:54:48| And this is something you would get in the mail if you asked for a visitor guide in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3288)|
| 0:54:53| You get this beautiful Knoxville envelope with a visitor guide in tow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3293)|
| 0:54:57| And we offer a ride-along program here with businesses here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3297)|
| 0:55:01| For a very, very minimal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| They can ride along with our visitor guide and be just right in front of that visitor who's planning a trip to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| We also offer that complimentary to our nonprofit organizations here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| So glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| The biggest part of Annie's job is merchandise and vendor relations in our gift shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| This is just an example of one of our baskets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| I believe you guys have seen these in the past, some of the things that we've put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| She works with local artists and vendors to make sure that we have not just the tchotchke items, the shot glasses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3325)|
| 0:55:32| the salt and pepper shakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3332)|
| 0:55:33| Those are great and a lot of people like to take them home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| But what a wonderful way to take home a gift by someone who lives here and makes things here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| So we have little story cards all throughout our visitor center showing who these artists are, what their story is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| why they decided to make these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| And it really makes an impact when someone's wanting to take home a little something personal as a remembrance of their trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| So that's a little bit about what I and Annie do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| I will turn it over to Kimberly Womack for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| You're a really hard act to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| Oh, my goodness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Sesquicentennial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| I'm going to be impressed when you can spell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Sorry, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I can spell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| A lot of spelling beef here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3375)|
| 0:56:16| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| My name is Kimberly Womack and I'm six feet tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| I'm really sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3382)|
| 0:56:23| I'll lean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| My name is Kimberly Womack and I work at the visitor center associate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3385)|
| 0:56:36| So I work at the front desk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| When you walk in the building, I'm sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| I greet and assist visitors as they come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3400)|
| 0:56:43| So I like the term leisure tourist, I think someone said, and that describes perfectly the person that I'm helping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| Also, local Knoxvillians will come in sometime and say, I've lived here for 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| and I've never been into the visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Tell me what I need to see in Knoxville, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| I've only been with Visit Knoxville since mid-January and I love all these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3422)|
| 0:57:10| Their love for Knoxville is absolutely infectious and I love it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3430)|
| 0:57:18| I love sort of bragging on Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| And I love it when someone comes into town and they've just stepped into the visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3443)|
| 0:57:28| They're like, I'm here for two hours, what do you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| And that's like, that's when I'm like, I shine, like paperwork goes flying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| I become like a brochure jockey and I kind of feel like a concierge for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3455)|
| 0:57:43| So I love it, so come see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| So the other thing I do is data capture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| So I'm capturing a lot of information about our visitorship, how many people are coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| and then I make quarterly reports for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| Another thing, I think my favorite thing is the kids corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3481)|
| 0:58:09| which is just a little corner in the visitor center where I set up coloring pages and crayons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3489)|
| 0:58:15| and it's basically where you can come and like park your child while you come talk to me about your plan for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3495)|
| 0:58:22| We also have Uniquely Kids Friday, which is every third Friday of the month, where I set out crafts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| and we also invite, for example, like an Iams naturalist will come and bring an owl| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| and do a little introduction, a little animal experience there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3513)|
| 0:58:38| And also I do some social media with Facebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3518)|
| 0:58:41| We have our own visitor center Facebook page, so I post first Friday artists that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| and also special events that are happening in the store or like sales and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| Did I forget something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| No, you did great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Happy Easter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3536)|
| 0:58:59| Kimberly is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| She has been with us just since January, and even though she lived here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| one of our first and foremost training things that we do is we get them, we hire them, bring them in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| and immediately kick them out the door and make sure they get into all these different attractions, museums, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| and that was really exciting for Kimberly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3553)|
| 0:59:15| She actually worked at Iams before she came on to visit Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| so even though she was out in that industry, getting her out into some of these museums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| ones she thought she might not enjoy, she ended up having a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| So that was very exciting, and that just allows her and our other visitor center associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| when we do that with them as well, allows them to get that personal experience when they're talking to that visitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| and that's really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| I mean, just saying, yeah, that's going to be a great museum for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Well, oh, yeah, I went there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| I shot hoops at the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| You know, I actually picked up something at James White's Fort and walked around all the cabins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| I mean, that's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| I didn't really have to jump very high when I was shooting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| She's so tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| I was six feet tall and I wore two-inch heels, and I just kind of went like boop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3595)|
| 0:59:59| It was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3599)|
| 1:00:00| She's good at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3600)|
| 1:00:01| Love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| Just wanted to very, just on the last note, mention a couple of things that we're very excited about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| that are recent additions to the visitor center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| Real quick, we added a visitor experience wall just recently where we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| or encouraging visitors to send a photograph of themselves having an experience in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| They can either post it to our Facebook page or they can e-mail it to Kimberly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| and we print that off and put that on a bulletin board there right beside the guest services desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| So this is creating a great visual for other visitors that come in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| gives us great talking points but also lets them see other people having a great time in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| Another thing, we added an iPad to the visitor center, and that's been very exciting for people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| We offer free Wi-Fi in the visitor center, and most everybody has a smart phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3645)|
| 1:00:49| but all of you that do know that they don't always work the way you want them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| So this iPad, while it does default, of course, to our mobile site that has tons of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| it also allows them to navigate wherever they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| If they need to grab onto their personal e-mail to get a confirmation number for their hotel room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| that they booked and forgot to bring with them or, you know, whatever they need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| they've got the flexibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| And the very last thing is our map of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| We're very excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| This has been hugely received, well received by our visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3675)|
| 1:01:18| They are pinpointing where they're visiting us from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| and I hope you guys will come into the visitor center soon and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| It's dotted profusely with little red pins everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3684)|
| 1:01:29| Visitors from Greenland, India, China, all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| It's very exciting, and we also offer them a little map, a little, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| a little notepad to leave a note for Knoxville, and they've done that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| We just thought there were going to be a couple notes around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| but we've had to add a big jar to put all those notes in because so many people are leaving us sweet notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| You know, this place is awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| I've never been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| I'm from Italy, and this place rocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| You have so much live music, you know, so many different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| So that's been really exciting and, again, another great visual for these visitors that are coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| and seeing us for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3724)|
| 1:02:05| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| Do you have in there the map of the urban wilderness, the trail system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| My name is Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| That's a real question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Now, see, I thought y'all were joking with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| I thought we were going back to don't entertain him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| If you say words like South Knoxville is open, you get him listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| No, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| We have all of our Greenways maps in the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| We have outdoor Knoxville stuff, everything in there for these outdoor visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| If there is someone, one of the things I forgot to mention, since it's a great thing that came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3756)|
| 1:02:41| if there is a visitor experience that we find that we have not approached yet for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3761)|
| 1:02:47| if we get asked the question once, we're on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| If we don't have something on it, whether they're not physically able to do it for themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| like I think Brad mentioned earlier, put something together for Kumba and that was Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3774)|
| 1:03:02| So we've done some brochures for those who were not able to do them for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| To make sure that that visitor experience is going to be great because we're going to have that information for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| Are you going to start offering food service again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| Microphone, son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| He asked if we were going to be offering food service again anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3799)|
| 1:03:24| Are you going to say it yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| Actually, probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| We have found that we've gotten really great reception from the locals on them being able to bring in their lunch for Blue Plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3813)|
| 1:03:42| And honestly, we have some little snacky stuff there for them to grab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| But at the end of the day, the visitor center, one of our expertise is really not running a cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3827)|
| 1:03:53| And we've also found on the two partnerships that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| it is not a profitable location for someone that does need to make a profit running a cafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| You know, we had a great relationship with Nancy Kendrick and the Coop Cafe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| and we were very honored to have them in our building for as long as we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| And we were very much a partner with her when she opened her new location and letting her out of our location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| because she just couldn't get the traffic that she needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| And I think where that boils down to is we're also a performance place at lunchtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| And, you know, if you're a cafe, you need to be able to turn tables and, you know, be able to service people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3868)|
| 1:04:34| When we've got 100 people crammed in there listening to the music, it's very hard for you to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3874)|
| 1:04:40| So I don't think that you'll see us go that route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| I honestly think that over time you'll see us remodel the downstairs so that we can maximize the space better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| which means changing the look of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| Is this the year we have a bluegrass festival?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| I hope. No. It's actually the year we talk about seriously planning that bluegrass festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| I think there's a lot of synergy out there right now on doing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3904)|
| 1:05:09| And we're honestly looking at doing some things right now with Boomsday this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| as it relates to tying a concert to it, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3915)|
| 1:05:20| Those things are we're in the talk. I said maybe, Rachel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Actually, now we are going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| So that's an awesome thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| Let me remind you of a couple of years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| No, no, no, no. I didn't say we were expanding to a three-day festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| I said we were adding a concert the day up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| But those are just things that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| And I think the cool thing there is that what that all means is that there's just a lot of people out there right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| that want to partner and that have really great ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| and then have the means in which to kind of bring some of that infrastructure to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| so that it doesn't all fall on Rachel, which it really should fall on Rachel as I think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3957)|
| 1:06:06| So, in fact, Rachel will be performing at Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| So, anyway, but, yeah, no, I think that, yes, we're definitely, we've got a lot of stuff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| We're in sort of a little region that can really draw from the surrounding states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| Yeah, you will be surprised that you're not the only one that's really kind of talking like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| I mean, I think there's a real chance to do something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3985)|
| 1:06:28| Twist that WDVX forum while you're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| Yeah, we have a great partnership with them, so we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| Does Kimberly or someone like that who's meeting folks coming in the visitor center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| did they ask what brought you to Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| How did you find out about us or why are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| Did you kind of poke at them a little bit to find out why they came to this door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| Oh, I poke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| It's more like a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| It's not people coming in and asking me for a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| It's like, where are you from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Why are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| What would you like to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| What are your interests?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| Where do you want to eat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| So, yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| Would you like to do a brain dump at the end of the day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| They're like backing out of the door, like, okay, we've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| We've got our list, brochures, thanks, bye-bye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| Let me recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4027)|
| 1:07:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4029)|
| 1:07:10| Segwaying off of that, there was a time, I think, when Knoxville had better music promotions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4030)|
| 1:07:16| I mean, you know, even AC with his interest locally was a lot stronger when I was younger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| promoting particular bands or whatever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| Of course, he's moved on to bigger festivals and bigger things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4047)|
| 1:07:30| but a friend of mine and I were talking, what do you all do exactly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| I mean, I know that's not your focus business, but working with smaller groups or bands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| especially with 90.3 and UT College of Rock, there's a big opportunity or missed opportunity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4059)|
| 1:07:46| because some people say, well, gosh, I just looked and saw or I just missed a band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| or a particular artist that I really would have loved to have seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4072)|
| 1:07:55| but they didn't even know they were in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| So, do you all do something on a smaller scale like that to promote a particular artist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| or do you think you would have a way to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| Well, I think that is definitely something that we're focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4083)|
| 1:08:06| and not necessarily just as it relates to concerts or the smaller concerts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4086)|
| 1:08:11| but we've heard that feedback on a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| Like, just in general, people think that there's not a lot going on in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| and that's because, you know, I hate to say it like this because it might step on toes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| but we have a whole lot of calendars out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| and what that means is it creates a lot of sporadic information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4108)|
| 1:08:32| And right now, we as a whole community and country are in this place called information overload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| So, as we push the information out there, a lot of people aren't looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| They're not reading it, and they're not receiving it, or they don't remember it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| or they got busy and distracted by a text, and so they didn't see this email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| So, that's a huge opportunity as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4132)|
| 1:08:55| I mean, I think one thing that we would love to do as we revamp our website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| is not negate anybody else's calendars because everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| every entity is going to want to have their own calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| They've got their own stakeholders, their own partners that they're trying to speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Some of them use them as revenue streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| I don't want to take that away from them, but what I do think we can do as we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| is really at Visit Knoxville take ownership of that master calendar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4159)|
| 1:09:24| because it would support an infrastructure to the visitor and then to the local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| And that really goes into just creating partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| and having RSS feeds for all the other calendars into ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| And that is something that's on our radar, not necessarily as it related to the example that you used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| but it would address that because I can't tell you how many times someone comes up to me and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| oh, I went to Atlanta because there was nothing to do in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| And I'm like, really? How would you think that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| I mean, are you not looking at some of the stuff? And they just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| Yeah. I mean, I think, unfortunately, it goes beyond just calendar of an event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| and someone's name and a time, like really showing that a particular artist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| and promoting that artist would sell it to a larger group of people maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Conversely, I was thinking, I have a friend in town from Portland this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| and he sent out a message Tuesday morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| He said, Pop Quiz, what would you do if your family were vacationing in Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| He has two kids, two, I think, and four or five-year-old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| My wife and I were trying to think, what are some good things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| And we threw out some ideas. Well, they did end up going to the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| They spent 80 bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| Well, a hike, I said, it was a really pretty day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| I told them, hey, check out House Mountain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| Someone threw out Chandler's on Magnolia. It would be a good place to have lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| A bounce house maybe or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| I hear there's a big thing coming to town related to that, and even the ice chalet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| But what would you say to young families or with younger children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| What would be a good activity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| Well, I think what you just hit are some of the big ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| But, you know, the whole urban wilderness and everything that's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| with some of the outdoor activities that are family-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| and I'm not saying that just for Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| Yeah, that's it, just for Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I like the outdoors and hiking, but a lot of kids get bored with that kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4274)|
| 1:11:17| They don't want it. You end up carrying them on your shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4277)|
| 1:11:20| That's so true. You just put them in a kayak, and you'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4280)|
| 1:11:24| Just drag them behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| No, I think Lainey can jump in here and add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| But, you know, just like, for instance, some of the programming that's going on this weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| that people don't think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| They have, and I'm going to say it wrong because it's not on the tip of my tongue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| but what's it called? Yeah, Funny Bunny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| The Funny Bunny Day is tomorrow at Crescent Bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| and they're having all kinds of programming geared towards kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| You have two Easter brunches this weekend on the Volunteer Princess and the Riverboat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| You also have, there's the bunnies at the zoo all weekend, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| with picture-taking opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4318)|
| 1:12:00| You know, we have a lot of bunnies running around this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4320)|
| 1:12:03| But they're everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4323)|
| 1:12:06| Let me reckon that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| Yeah, he knows the Cozy Bunny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4329)|
| 1:12:11| Okay, let me reckon that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| What? You don't know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| I was just thinking about his remark about the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| and there is a great deal to do at the zoo that is hopefully going to be better promoted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| and some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| But the zoo can be a two-day visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| Definitely, and I think we're going to, you're going to see over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| that we're going to be telling the story of those experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| whether they're geared towards that outdoor enthusiast or family-friendly or kid-only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| We're going to be telling that story in a more dynamic way as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4368)|
| 1:12:53| But all of this just takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4373)|
| 1:12:55| And, you know, we've gotten a whole lot done in a very short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| but it's really just now getting crazy started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4379)|
| 1:13:03| I mean, that ball's really rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| So we're just only going to pick up speed from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| We're going to have to end here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| Jill, I see you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Do you have anything that you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Speech?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| Jill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4396)|
| 1:13:20| Just identify yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I'm Jill Thompson, address 7520 Hollyquest Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| I'm the executive director of the Greater Knoxville Hospitality Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| We're the trade association for the hotels, the restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| Our membership collects the tax that puts these individuals to work to go out and sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4416)|
| 1:13:42| and bring more people in to pay more tax into the hotel and bring sales tax into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4422)|
| 1:13:48| and allow us to enjoy everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| So I'm just here for moral support, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4430)|
| 1:13:54| I'm just impressed with this whole team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| They are very cohesive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4437)|
| 1:13:59| They're very forward thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4439)|
| 1:14:02| And anything that we can do as a community to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I mean, it's all about the support that they're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| They can't do it by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| Again, we're a very friendly community, but we need to support them as well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4452)|
| 1:14:16| So I'm here for moral support, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| We've gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Counselor McGreeve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Yeah, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| I'll use the microphone this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Are we, as far as the city, have we done a good job in terms of directing people to the visitor center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4468)|
| 1:14:34| And if you had your way, would that be where the visitor center would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| And do you have problems with people getting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| Is our signage good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| The new signage that's gone up has been awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| I mean, it really has benefited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| And once we've opened the â once we opened our parking lot up to two-hour parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4491)|
| 1:14:57| and we emptied it out so it's totally open for people to utilize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4497)|
| 1:15:01| that's really increased our visitation, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4501)|
| 1:15:05| And it's also given us a way to be able to track who's coming in when they come in and check in to get their permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4505)|
| 1:15:11| And we really haven't been at capacity yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| So what that means is that we have to do a better job of making sure we promote where the visitor center is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| and what's offered at the visitor center, and we're very much behind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4525)|
| 1:15:26| We've gone well over an hour, and I know some other members have got more meetings this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4526)|
| 1:15:32| So if there's no further questions, and we've got a public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| I don't see anybody here that nobody signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| So we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilworkshop130328?start=4543)|
