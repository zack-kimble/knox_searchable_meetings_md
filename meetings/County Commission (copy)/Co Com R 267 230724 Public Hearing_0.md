| 0:01:54| More and more often we do encounter businesses that are looking to cut their utility bills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=114.5)|

| 0:02:19| One of our commercial clients right here in East Tennessee will have a solar PV system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=139.5)|

| 0:02:29| that can island the facility during an outage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=149.5)|
| 0:02:32| That reduces utility demand and in turn reduces operating costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=152.5)|
| 0:02:36| In striving to meet their corporate sustainability goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=156.5)|

| 0:03:01| or CPACER program, as simply another tool that could help businesses save operating costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=181.5)|
| 0:03:07| improve infrastructure, and be better equipped to compete in the marketplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=187.5)|
| 0:03:11| If CPACER is something that could sensibly be implemented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=191.5)|
| 0:03:15| perhaps it could help economic development and growth for our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=195.5)|

| 0:03:51| If there's not any, there's a couple points that I'd just like to go over whenever, if I have the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=231.5)|
| 0:03:57| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=237.5)|

| 0:03:59| So, first and foremost, thank you for giving me the time to be here to talk to you for a brief moment about CPACER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=239.5)|
| 0:04:05| Whenever I stumbled upon this, it was geared more towards the blighted commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=245.5)|
| 0:04:10| where we've had some issues coming up that we've noticed more than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=250.5)|
| 0:04:15| To my left is going to be the Deputy Trustee for the Knox County Trustee's Office, Robin Benton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=255.5)|
| 0:04:19| She's been here for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=259.5)|
| 0:04:21| Actually, Robin, you've been here for 39 years, and I applaud you, so I want to give you a brief round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=261.5)|
| 0:04:29| So, she started when she was 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=269.5)|
| 0:04:31| She's probably going to hurt me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=271.5)|
| 0:04:32| Anyway, so one of the things that we've noticed going through our previous tax sales is we've started looking at the commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=272.5)|
| 0:04:38| in every single one of your districts, and we went out and we've taken about 75 to 80 pictures of some of these commercial properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=278.5)|
| 0:04:44| that we've sold, and nobody's doing anything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=284.5)|
| 0:04:47| And so we're trying to reach back out to see, you know, what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=287.5)|
| 0:04:51| The taxes are being paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=291.5)|
| 0:04:52| There's just no movement there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=292.5)|
| 0:04:54| And whenever we're starting to look into the direction that the county is going, I look at the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=294.5)|
| 0:04:59| So I've spoken with the City of Knoxville about some of the things that they do inside their area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=299.5)|
| 0:05:03| and I was pleasantly surprised that they're also interested in Seapacer as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=303.5)|
| 0:05:07| I had a long meeting with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=307.5)|
| 0:05:10| Actually, last week, we talked about the benefits for the chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=310.5)|
| 0:05:13| We talked about the benefits for the city, for the county, and the direction that this could make us go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=313.5)|
| 0:05:18| So, real quick, I just want to give you guys a quick listing of some of the things that you can actually look at that would qualify for Seapacer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=318.5)|
| 0:05:26| Water irrigation, commercial refrigeration, permeable pavement, lighting, heating, cooling, windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=326.5)|
| 0:05:32| insulations, pumps and motors, solar panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=332.5)|
| 0:05:36| We also have electric vehicle charging, flood protection, seismic upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=336.5)|
| 0:05:40| That means since we're on the fault line, we do fall into this portion of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=340.5)|
| 0:05:44| That's the structure of the framing of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=344.5)|
| 0:05:47| Whether the beaming and things of that nature, that's what seismic upgrades is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=347.5)|
| 0:05:50| Stormwater, tornado shelters, roof, floors, doors, and also wind turbines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=350.5)|
| 0:05:55| The wind turbines, I don't foresee that being that big of an issue here in Knox County and the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=355.5)|
| 0:06:00| but those are the things that would fall underneath the Seapacer guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=360.5)|
| 0:06:04| So, the next step was is we came to you guys last month, and I know you guys probably see a sense of urgency within me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=364.5)|
| 0:06:12| and the reason being is because we are preparing the tax statements right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=372.5)|
| 0:06:15| Tax statements are we're getting ready to ship off to the comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=375.5)|
| 0:06:19| and then they'll send it back to us in the next upcoming couple of weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=379.5)|
| 0:06:22| and I'm going to put a Seapacer pamphlet in every single piece of commercial property if this is passed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=382.5)|
| 0:06:28| so that way we can let everybody know that owns commercial property that this is an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=388.5)|
| 0:06:33| that this is something that they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=393.5)|
| 0:06:35| So, right now we have a little over 228,000 parcels in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=395.5)|
| 0:06:41| We send out about 155,000 tax bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=401.5)|
| 0:06:44| The rest are on mortgages, and we get those through CoreLogic and other areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=404.5)|
| 0:06:49| but about right now we've got close to five-digit numbers that we're going to be sending out to commercial properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=409.5)|
| 0:06:57| and the direction this could take us, I mean, just alone in every single district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=417.5)|
| 0:07:02| I think everybody up here has some blotted property in their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=422.5)|
| 0:07:07| Earlier today we were getting together a tax sell list, and I was noticing in every single district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=427.5)|
| 0:07:12| there's a lot of parcels of this go around in a lot of areas that could need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=432.5)|
| 0:07:16| So I saw a need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=436.5)|
| 0:07:18| We started diving into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=438.5)|

| 0:08:20| and on page 8 it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=500.5)|
| 0:08:22| residential property consisting of four or fewer dwelling units does not qualify for financing under the CPACER program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=502.5)|
| 0:08:31| So the assumption there is if the lot has four units or less, they don't qualify then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=511.5)|
| 0:08:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=520.5)|

| 0:08:59| reaching that four and a half more units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=539.5)|

| 0:09:25| So I'm assuming if you have one lot with four condos on it, it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=565.5)|

| 0:09:52| If you have one lot, if it's whatever, it can only have, if it has four or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230724-public-hearing_202307?start=592.5)|
