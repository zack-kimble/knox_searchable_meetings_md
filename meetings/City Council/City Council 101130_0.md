| 0:01:23| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=83)|

| 0:02:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=121)|
| 0:02:02| Minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=122)|
| 0:02:03| Items dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=123)|
| 0:02:04| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| I'd like to postpone for two weeks item 10B, which is in connection with 11G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| Mr. Hunt with Callaway Oil had to be out of town, and he asked if we could postpone that for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=138)|
| 0:02:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Moved and seconded to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=147)|
| 0:02:29| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| All those in favor of postponing for two weeks, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| Vice Mayor Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=157)|
| 0:02:38| This is an item dealing with the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| It's not a postponement or a withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| I'd like to move 11F and 10A to directly after 9H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=161)|
| 0:02:47| These are all items that deal with the same piece of property up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| and I think we'll understand them better if we talk about them all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=171)|
| 0:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| That would be 10A after 9H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| They're all the North Shore Town Center things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| 10A would have already followed, so you really just want 11F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| It would have followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| And we're going to hand the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=195)|
| 0:03:19| I think technically it's not never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=199)|
| 0:03:21| It's I'll withdraw that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Councilman Grieve, is that an old light or new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| Okay, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| Anything else dealing with the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=208)|
| 0:03:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| We'll move on real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Mayor's report two or three things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| Three consent items, 11H through J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| Is there a motion to approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=223)|
| 0:03:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=225)|
| 0:03:46| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=226)|
| 0:03:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=227)|
| 0:03:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Those are all approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Very quickly, Mayor's report, three items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=231)|
| 0:03:54| First of all, December 10th, which will be before our next meeting at 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| we're having the grand opening of one of the pieces of the Riverwalk down across the river,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=238)|
| 0:04:02| part of our South Knoxville Waterfront Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Hopefully, they've all gotten notice or will, but December 10th at 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| and we would love to have you there as we complete that piece of the grand plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| Number two, I want to salute Chief Owen and the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Knoxville Police Department's training academy was recently awarded flagship status from CALEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=259)|
| 0:04:25| which is significant because the police department itself has also received flagship status from CALEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=265)|
| 0:04:33| The significance is I think we're the only agency that has at the same time had its training academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| and its police force have CALEA flagship status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| So it shows the leadership and the excellence that KPD has devoted themselves to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=282)|
| 0:04:48| and congratulations on that, Chief Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Last, I want to remind everybody this Friday is the WIVK Fowlers Christmas Parade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| and I know everybody always enjoys being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=297)|
| 0:04:59| and somehow we always manage to have it be the coldest night of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| and it looks like maybe Friday night will be that again anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| Regardless, we'd love to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| It starts at 630 this Friday, December 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| It starts at the Coliseum and then Historic Preservation to Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| right on Hill, right on Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| So we'd love to have everybody there, and obviously council typically walks or rides together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=316)|
| 0:05:22| and we look forward to that, but that's this Friday night at 630.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| And thanks to everybody who was a part of the celebration of lights last Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| We had a mob of people downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=329)|
| 0:05:31| It was a great night, and I think everybody really enjoyed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| Okay, that's it for Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=336)|
| 0:05:38| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| We have a couple of cemeteries in the Westview community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=342)|
| 0:05:45| that have suffered from neglect for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| and so three different groups have come together to try to rectify that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| The Knox County Sheriff's Department has supplied the manpower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| to clear the area of crushed tires and dumped furniture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| and that has really lifted the spirits of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| as well as given a great view of downtown from some parts of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=364)|
| 0:06:08| The second was a private business called Max Tire Recyclers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| and they put a collection point in ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| they have a collection point in Knoxville in a grinding center in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=376)|
| 0:06:21| and they grind the tires and use them on playgrounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| and they pull 200 tires out of that area to grind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| So that was a huge help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=387)|
| 0:06:29| Then the city of Knoxville has really helped with getting rid of all the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=389)|
| 0:06:33| that have been cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| I think this is a great example of city, county, government, neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| and private business working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=399)|
| 0:06:40| and I just wanted to salute everybody who was involved with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=400)|
| 0:06:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Yes, thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| I just wanted to announce that Historic Old North Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| is having its 22nd annual Victorian Holiday Home Tour this Saturday and Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=413)|
| 0:07:00| That's Saturday, December 4th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| That will be from 4 to 9 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| and Sunday, December 5th, from 12, 30 p.m. to 5 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| There will be a ticket booth at the St. Mary's Hospital parking lot off Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| Council members are invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| and I think they even have tickets for you to come if you want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=436)|
| 0:07:19| But everyone in the city is invited, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| and you can pick up your tickets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=441)|
| 0:07:23| Great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| Yes, I'd just like to make note that I was able to attend a luncheon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| and seminar today at Mount Calvary Baptist Church on Danridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| and that seminar dealt with Alzheimer's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=457)|
| 0:07:40| and especially Alzheimer's disease and African Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=460)|
| 0:07:46| And I want to commend the staff of Mount Calvary with Reverend Leroy Franklin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=466)|

| 0:08:07| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=488)|
| 0:08:09| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| You'll recall this was a census year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=490)|
| 0:08:12| A lot of data was collected in the early part of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=492)|
| 0:08:16| Data is going to start coming out towards the beginning of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| and we're going to be faced with redistricting city council seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| before the next election in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| I wanted to ask Rick Emmett to talk a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=507)|
| 0:08:30| Rick worked with the redistricting the county did recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=510)|
| 0:08:34| but he's also familiar with how some of that data flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| and just ask him to give us a quick preview of what probably will be happening next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=517)|
| 0:08:44| So, Mr. Emmett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| Our timeline is probably going to be the end of March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| We should receive our census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| It will come from the comptroller's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=530)|
| 0:08:52| so possibly Governor Haslam can get us our data quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=532)|
| 0:08:56| But we've only got until June is the key information there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| I think that's the qualifying deadline for petitions for running for office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| So we've got a pretty short timeline to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Just as information, in 2000 we had like 173,000-some folks in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=547)|
| 0:09:15| Projections now have us at like 185,000, 186,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| So unless all those folks did us a favor and moved equally into districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| chances are we're probably going to have to revise those lines somehow or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| So we're thinking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Like Mr. Becker said, I've had a practice run at it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| It may be a question, Rick, for you or Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| How does the legal process work of that redistricting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| As far as who's responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=577)|
| 0:09:39| Who's responsible, who makes the calls, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Who gets to draw the lines, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| Ultimately, city council gets to draw the lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| but there are certain parameters within which they have to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| There are certain legal issues that have to be addressed in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| And Mr. Emmett is absolutely fabulous at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| I've been through the process with him now twice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| and he is absolutely good at what he does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| and will be of great assistance to council in setting out what needs to happen in order to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| I mean, generally he comes with two or three options as to what may be available to council to do the redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=608)|
| 0:10:18| But I would have to say that you have to remember that there are legal parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=618)|
| 0:10:24| within which you have to work in order to constitutionally satisfy the redistricting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=624)|
| 0:10:35| And so you can't do it just any way you want to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| and we need to be aware of that as we go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| But as I said, Rick is great at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| and you'll find your process is made much easier through his efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=644)|
| 0:10:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Rick, anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| Councilman Roddy, is this for this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Okay, thank you, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=655)|
| 0:10:56| And Bob, thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| That is actually a big issue coming around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| and there is a tight window so that folks who want to run know who's going to be in what district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Marilyn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=665)|

| 0:11:25| and they do a great deal of outreach in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| as well as their concerts at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=688)|

| 0:15:41| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Yeah, I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| I think, Mr. Donaldson, I asked this one two weeks ago, but I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| When the changes started happening in this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| we originally had an ordinance to change the conditions for the T-C-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| That's still out there someplace, and the planning commission does hope to bring that up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| Am I correct on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| Not necessarily in that form, but there are changes to the zone in the works, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=966)|
| 0:16:11| I feel that the process of development of that property highlights the changes that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=971)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=980)|
| 0:16:42| Your sense would be actually to wait until somebody else wants to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| or is it just there's too much to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1007)|
| 0:16:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1016)|
| 0:16:58| Not on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1018)|

| 0:17:01| Would you like to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1021)|

| 0:18:16| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| It's just next, so don't go far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1099)|

| 0:18:50| which is a resolution approving an appeal by Julie Patton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| There's obviously somebody that wants to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Does anybody want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1138)|
| 0:19:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1140)|
| 0:19:01| Resume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| We got your name and address, and we have the string, so you just go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1142)|
| 0:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| My apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| This thread represents basically the property line between our subdivision, my home, and this liquor store, proposed liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1148)|
| 0:19:17| I was raised on a farm, and my wife was exposed to several different living situations from one extreme to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| With young children and a career, we chose, made a choice, to look for a residential area, residential lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1162)|
| 0:19:31| We sought out a relatively quiet, safe neighborhood with plenty of children, good school district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| and we landed in North Shore Landing as a place to raise our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Everyone knows that there's one kid, no matter what, always reserves the right to change the rules in any game to their advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1182)|
| 0:19:50| As an adult, we've learned one of those kids is a rule called spot annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| This is the law that allows the city to change the rules regarding property as they see fit with no regards to county residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1198)|
| 0:20:04| Had our entire neighborhood been included in the annexation of this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| we question whether the city would be willing to gamble with our property values by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| Because of spot annexation, I stand before you tonight, because of spot annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| the environment we work to provide for our children has been compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| Our neighborhood fought through the original development of North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| but over time and with many assurances that we would be protected with transitional zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| most of us settled in to finish what we started as families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| a safe and comfortable place to raise a family and did not fight this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| Again, there was a plan with the transitional zoning and we were assured of the green space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1244)|
| 0:20:50| and transitional spaces that would keep our neighborhood safe and secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| I feel quite confident Mr. Richardson is a fine person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| His desire to achieve free enterprise is completely understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| However, it is not free enterprise if it compromises my family's safety, their freedom and my property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1264)|
| 0:21:14| We feel that it will damage, financially damage our property value and the safety of my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1274)|
| 0:21:20| and the kids in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| I'm a business owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| I own a 50,000 square foot manufacturing facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| but my manufacturing facility is not located in my backyard or next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| It is located in an industrial park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| My company will produce $9 million in revenue this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1296)|
| 0:21:39| That revenue is generated off retail and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| I'm not against growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| I'm just against growth of this particular establishment as my next door neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| The thread, this difference between city and county, will not protect our sense of security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1314)|
| 0:21:59| It will not stand between us and the undesirable environment that a liquor store presents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1319)|
| 0:22:05| That thread will not keep people from using our neighborhood as a place to park and drink a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| It will not keep people from using our neighborhood as a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| It will not keep our children safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| At the NPC meeting, this establishment was called a wine store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| But calling it a wine store does not make this location a correct fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Calling it a wine store will not keep patrons who've already had a few drinks from driving to it to get some more to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1345)|
| 0:22:32| We're concerned that this thread that separates us from the city will become a tangled mess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| removing the freedom and quality of life that our kids and grandkids in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| and reduce our property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| There are 99 acres of undeveloped land in North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| There is an existing building that is already zoned to house a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| We are not asking you to ban Mr. Richardson from his right to free enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| We are simply asking you to protect us also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| 99 acres, over 1,000 feet of frontage on North Shore and 3,000 feet visible from Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1382)|
| 0:23:10| With 99 acres to choose from, we are debating the thread size property line that will negatively impact our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1390)|
| 0:23:15| and be our property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1395)|
| 0:23:17| When we purchased our house ten years ago, we purchased in a safe neighborhood with a house on each side of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1397)|
| 0:23:22| in a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| We did not purchase in a commercial retail area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| We did not purchase in a downtown environment because that is not an environment we wanted to live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and raise our children in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| The MPC was under tremendous pressure to prove a use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| that the staff clearly defined as direct conflict to the zoning of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| Instead of a professional office with limited hours and clientele or a bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| which again has marginal hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| the MPC has decided that a liquor store open from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| to allow next to an established neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| We thought people would do what was right for all involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| but we understand the power of peer pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1438)|
| 0:24:02| I stand here tonight asking you to untangle the thread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| I ask you what your thoughts would be if Mr. Richardson wanted to tear down your neighbor's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| and build his liquor store next door to you and be your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| How would that affect your kids, family, and grandkids?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| When you talked to your real estate agent about finding you a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| did he ask him to find you a nice house next to the liquor store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| Neither did I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| We are asking you tonight not to let this thread of a property line become a table mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| There's also Will Patton signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| Will, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| If you could give us your name and address, too, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1483)|
| 0:24:47| Will Patton, 9800 Christie Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1487)|
| 0:24:55| Can I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Yes, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| My name is Will, and I am 12 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| I have started the countdown to driving, two years, three months, and one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| But for now, my freedom is limited by how far I'm allowed to walk or bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| I enjoy playing baseball, basketball, and riding my bike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| I like being able to run around the neighborhood with my buddies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Actually, I am hoping to gain a little more freedom this spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| But if you allow anyone to build a business with no limits, then I will be forced to endure it at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| Just because we are young now, please don't forget about me and my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you, Will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| We also have some people signed up to speak, I guess, against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| Mr. Seymour, would you like to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| Will, can I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1545)|
| 0:25:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1546)|
| 0:25:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1547)|
| 0:25:48| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| This is a junior patent, although the junior one was quite an effective speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| The rezoning that happened five years ago, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| When that was going on, can you tell me what your understanding was of what the buffer would be like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| And I know it was five years, and I'm sure it was a lot of fairly boring meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| But tell me what you thought was going to be happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| There was all kinds of discussions about 30 feet of transitional green space and buffers with tree lines and different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1569)|
| 0:26:17| Now there is, next door to my house, there is probably 15 feet of space, but it's straight down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| So my kids right now, outside shooting basketball, if they miss, it will go in the parking lot of a liquor store, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| But our understanding was there would be 30 or somewhat feet with tree lines and green space to separate things from our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1591)|
| 0:26:40| But sort of the buffer you were thinking about was that green space buffer, not necessarily there were going to be houses there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1600)|
| 0:26:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Mr. Mayor, members of council, Mr. Richardson has a diagram of the store that has been approved by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1614)|
| 0:27:06| And I'm going to ask his son, Brett, to bring that up here and display it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| This is part of the town center zone, the North Shore town center zone, and it is in the peripheral zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1632)|
| 0:27:21| The use of this property under the peripheral zone allows, as a matter of right, certain uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1641)|
| 0:27:32| Those include hotels, motels, eating and drinking establishments, clubs and lodges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| churches, which we would submit would have a much larger impact on the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| than would a wine and spirit store such as Mr. Richardson proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| He is proposing on a half-acre lot a 3,500-foot square building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| This use was approved by the MPC overwhelmingly with restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| Under state law, wine and spirit stores can be open only Monday through Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| They are closed on certain designated holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| They are not open on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| We suggested that our hours be limited to 930 Monday through Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1698)|
| 0:28:26| and that they be limited to 10 o'clock on Fridays and Saturday nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| And our suggestion, MPC, did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| There will be, between the store and North Shore Landing, a landscape buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1716)|
| 0:28:46| We have already been approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals for reduced parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| Young Mr. Richardson works at a wine store here in Knoxville already, Bob's Package Store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| They find that their clientele, most of their clientele leaves by six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| The traffic they get after six o'clock in the evening tends to be minimal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| because of the people stop there on the way home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1751)|
| 0:29:17| MPC estimated the traffic impact based on standard traffic studies of 200 cars a day coming into the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1757)|
| 0:29:28| Those would tend to concentrate on a Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| We think this is an entirely appropriate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| Under the TC zone or the town center zone, if the MPC finds, which they did in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1776)|
| 0:29:47| that a use such as this wine store has no more negative impact on surrounding neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| than a restaurant, a bar, a hotel, or a lodge or a drinking establishment, they can approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1795)|
| 0:30:07| I would submit that under the permitted uses, there are many more that are much heavier impacts than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1807)|
| 0:30:14| This is a very light footprint there, and we would ask that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1814)|
| 0:30:22| The importance of this is also for the development of the town center, and Mr. Cullen may want to speak on that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1822)|
| 0:30:31| There has been little or no activity out there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| If this appeal is denied, which we're asking you to do tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| Mr. Richardson intends to close on this store within the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| He intends to start construction immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| Bob Slack is ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| He has the building plans developed for this two-story building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| which is architecturally compatible with the rest of the town center development that Mr. Cullen hopes to start very shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1858)|
| 0:31:10| So with that, I would ask you to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1870)|
| 0:31:16| Let us finally get started five, six years after the initial proposal for the North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1876)|
| 0:31:25| Let us commence work on this center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| And with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Cullen for a few brief remarks, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| And Mr. Cullen, as you know, is working on the balance of the town, North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| Mr. Mayor, members of the Council, Bud Cullen, 6312 Kingston Pike, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Wow, what a spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| This, as I think you know, obviously the property that I represent was the agenda item immediately preceding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1912)|
| 0:31:59| Although I don't have direct involvement in this, I think what Mr. Seymour says is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1919)|
| 0:32:06| we have the 99 acres that Mr. Patton referred to, and we have plans for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1926)|
| 0:32:12| And it is my understanding that the Richardsons are prepared, if this appeal is denied, to begin construction immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1932)|
| 0:32:21| I personally feel that this would be a good use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| I think it's – I tend to agree with everything that Mr. Seymour has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| I think it could be a good catalyst for our development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| So although I don't have a direct financial stake in this property that they would be purchasing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| or certainly the Wine and Spirits store, I think as a neighbor on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| as opposed to Mr. Patton on the residential side, I feel like it could certainly spur the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| From a philosophical standpoint, I certainly have empathy with Mr. Patton on one hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| I grew up in a family of teetotalers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| I know that the – whether you call it wine, spirits, liquor, beer, alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| generally can be a very charged topic, especially in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| However, with that being said, I think that if you go and you look at some of the other stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| that would be analogous to what the Richardsons are planning to that come to mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| because they're near where I live and work would be Ash's or Bob's, I think that you see –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2010)|
| 0:33:39| I wouldn't think that you would see any situation of a recurring pattern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| that you would worry about that store any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| It probably, in my opinion, would worry less than if you had larger stores next to you, other stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| certainly restaurants that are actually serving alcohol on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| So with that being said, hopefully this council realizes that I'm in the middle a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| Mr. Seymour asked me if I would be willing to give my thoughts, so I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| And those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| I think this would be a good use and it would be something that could spur development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| I've known the Richardsons for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| I think that they will be upstanding and run this with all the diligence possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| And Mr. Richardson, would you like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2069)|
| 0:34:38| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| Chuck Richardson, 416 Kittiwatt Trail, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| Council persons, Governor-elect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I don't have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| I was talking to every one of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| I appreciate your time and the efforts that you all put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| I'll answer any questions any of you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2096)|
| 0:35:02| Mr. Patton, I hope that sooner or later we can get acquainted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| and I won't be vilified in your mind and we can be friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| But we just simply want to run a clean business, be productive, pay taxes, contribute to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2109)|
| 0:35:18| You can see by the name that we're proposing that we want to be part of the Farragut community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2118)|
| 0:35:25| So with that, if anyone has any questions, it might be my privilege to try to answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Mr. Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| To Mr. Seymour, you had mentioned that the possibility of a restaurant could go on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| What are the legal hours of restaurants that serve liquor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| They can be open until 3 a.m. in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| I think they can start at 6 a.m., except on Sunday when I think they have to wait until noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| It may even be earlier than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| But that is the only limitation on a restaurant or bar in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2162)|
| 0:36:09| And then also, excuse me, can you share with us the economic impact that this business would have, you know, for the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2169)|
| 0:36:18| And I may turn that over to Mr. Richardson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| You give council your construction costs, your employment, and you hope your annual sales volume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2181)|
| 0:36:29| We project over 30 jobs would be generated by the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| When we're finished, we would have five to seven full-time employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| Projected to do somewhere in two and a half, three million dollars and be paying taxes on all that, all those sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2201)|
| 0:36:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| One of the things that does concern me is the fact that I know we're going to want to keep our services up in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| We certainly don't want to raise taxes, so we're going to have to look to development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| and look for tax revenue coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| And I see that this is a tax generator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| And, as you said, it will start off hopefully the rest of the development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2223)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Mr. DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| Mr. Richardson, I'm looking at, I guess it's page five of six, the landscape plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I was going to ask you on that western border that borders Mr. Patton's property, how wide is that vegetative buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2241)|
| 0:37:30| You show various things like holly trees and cypress and southern magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| How wide is that buffer zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| Well, it's approximately 20 to 25 percent of our total property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| And if you'll notice, we've positioned the structure as far away from their property line as we could possibly get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| I don't have a number in feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| It looks like one inch equals what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Thirty feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I would say it's roughly 10,000 square feet of vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| The area that is the buffer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| Anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| I couldn't tell you beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| Mr. DelVolpe, I would point out one reason we asked for a reduction in the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| which the variance the Board of Zoning Appeals granted was to reduce asphalt, increase the buffering through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2299)|
| 0:38:29| plus studies supported that the parking that was required for this facility was not necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| because the typical trip is five to ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| So it's an in-out kind of business rather than a linger kind of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2321)|
| 0:38:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| And I noticed also in the MPC notes that there was discussion of having some moderated lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2326)|
| 0:38:50| so that it would not reflect on the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| I think in the you flip over to the next page, which would be six of six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2333)|
| 0:39:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| The lighting for the sign is shown, and you've got four lights in the parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| and three lights, excuse me, four lights on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| And is it that westernmost one that they were concerned about, some down lighting that did not reflect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| Well, all the lighting on the building is down lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| All the lighting is down lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Mr. Patton, you have, by rules, two minutes to give a rebuttal if you would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| if you have anything to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2376)|
| 0:39:37| You don't have to, but our rules allow you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| I'm not concerned about the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| I'm concerned about the patrons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| And we can sit here and say all day long that they're not coming in drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| But when my kid gets injured, I'm going to be upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| And we're all going to be upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| That's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| That's what we're trying to prevent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| And I know that a liquor store can go somewhere, and there's one on the other side of North Shore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| other side of Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| But we are trying to prevent this right here in this residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| There's a bus stop across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| There's a school zone for this area, is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| I don't know if this transitional area is really legal for a restaurant or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| and what hours that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I just know I'm trying to protect my family and my property value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2431)|
| 0:40:35| and the people of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| And I just don't think this is the right place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| There's 99 other acres here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| There's other locations besides this residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| There was a house there when I bought the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| It was a zoned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| I did not look to move next to a bar or a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| I ask you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Would you go buy a house next to a liquor store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| If this goes in, do you want to send your kids or grandkids over to play at my house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2461)|
| 0:41:06| They can go out after 11 o'clock at night when the liquor store closes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| and they can play freely then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| That is what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| That's what we're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| I understand business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2474)|
| 0:41:15| I understand taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Just don't make it all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Okay, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2480)|
| 0:41:21| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| Well, looking at this landscaping by Mr. Richardson, I think there has been a great deal of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2483)|
| 0:41:34| That makes me feel a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| But I wanted to ask Mr. Cullum a question about the adjacent property along the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| and what you had in mind in terms of potential buffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2502)|
| 0:41:47| I guess it's to the north of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| You know, it adjoins the residential area all the way up through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| and this is probably not the first that we'll hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| So I was wondering what you had in mind in terms of, as a developer, some type of buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2518)|
| 0:42:05| Councilman Bailey, as it turns out, the property that is directly adjacent to this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2525)|
| 0:42:13| was not part of the property we purchased up to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| At the point where it became our property and then extending, I think that would be north, northeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2536)|
| 0:42:26| is actually property that we have just donated some and sold some to the county for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2546)|
| 0:42:32| And, in fact, that transaction closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2552)|
| 0:42:34| Like parcel 94?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| Is that what it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| I can't see with or without these glasses, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2557)|
| 0:42:47| It's west of Thunderhead Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2567)|
| 0:42:55| Is that Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2575)|
| 0:43:03| 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2583)|
| 0:43:04| Yes, 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| Councilman Bailey, 94 was property that was not part of what we purchased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2587)|
| 0:43:14| 98 and, even with my glasses on, I think 58 is part of the property that we donated some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2594)|
| 0:43:26| and sold some for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| And then the remainder of the property that we have would abut the neighborhood on north of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2610)|
| 0:43:39| And at that point, that's property that, frankly, is probably in our third or fourth or later phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2619)|
| 0:43:50| Most likely, that's going to be residential property at that point back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| I don't know if that answered your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| I was just thinking this is probably not going to be the last one of these appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2639)|
| 0:44:04| I mean, there's going to be concern about the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| We've heard that on other developments, and I thought maybe you could give us a little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2646)|
| 0:44:12| some insights on what your thoughts were beyond this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| And, again, I hadn't given it a whole lot of thought because the only part that is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| of our property that's going to be adjacent to that property is clear back in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| And right now, our plan is for that to be single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| So it would be an identical use that it would be abutting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2671)|
| 0:44:35| So, I mean, it would be conjecture and more philosophical talk on my part to suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2675)|
| 0:44:43| what someone else does with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| I'm kind of, I think I'm probably going to go off in the left field a little bit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| but I get to do that every now and again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| And I guess part of this is sort of related to the questions I asked Mr. Donaldson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| on the last one about changes on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| When the rezoning that we approved a few minutes ago came up originally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| well, it didn't come up originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| It was let's change the town center zone to make this development happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| And this council, I think, made a really good decision about saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| the town center zone really is something very different from everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| Town center is not about, it's not supposed to necessarily be easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2722)|
| 0:45:28| It's supposed to be about a town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| The great shining example is, of course, downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| And it feels like we're having a little bit of a really strange discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| about buffers and what's next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| And I see Mr. Wetzel sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| And I can just imagine sort of having a discussion with Mr. Wetzel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| about downtown development and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| now do we put a 30- or a 60-foot green barrier around downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| It doesn't feel like that's the way we should be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| I'm kind of surprised to hear that we have a town center zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| that actually says we're going to have a barrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| between the town center and what's next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| That doesn't feel right at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| And I don't know how things got explained five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| I was here, but I've slept since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| Because if I were sitting here and somebody had started talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| what's the transition going to be between these houses and the town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| I probably wouldn't have pictured a liquor store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| But I also wouldn't have pictured a 30- or 40-foot green buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| So this feels really strange to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| And I think the question that we've got here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| is this what our vision of a town center zone should be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2797)|
| 0:46:41| And Mr. Seymour pointed out, and I think the notes from the MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2801)|
| 0:46:48| really said this is one of those things are allowed in the periphery if we think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| And I think I'm correct on that analysis, Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| And I don't know, the liquor store doesn't bother me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| near as much as the green space that seems important to everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2822)|
| 0:47:05| I'd like to say that a town center is something that's connected to the town next to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| And it doesn't quite seem to be happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| And I don't know what that means about what I'm doing on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| I think in the long run, the changes that need to happen to town center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2835)|
| 0:47:21| I think need to happen before somebody else comes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| because it does need to be something different and better from what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| But that's just kind of my soapbox speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Yes, Mr. Mayor, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| And maybe, Bud, you could come up and take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| This is a site plan that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| It's a Paulson Mitchell site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| And this goes a little bit to what Vice Mayor Becker is talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2869)|
| 0:47:54| if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| It appears as though there's a 30-foot buffer all along the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| but I'm not quite sure where the property line is on that particular track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2882)|
| 0:48:09| Are you familiar with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| Maybe Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| It's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2901)|
| 0:48:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| What I'm talking about, Arthur, is here on this particular map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| Is his property just this piece with the property beyond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| I couldn't tell from the information given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2924)|
| 0:48:58| You all might as much as possible use microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2938)|
| 0:49:07| If I'm reading this right, that should be north right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2947)|
| 0:49:15| Yeah, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| So there is a line between the actual property line and his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| There's that 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2966)|
| 0:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| Anything else, Mr. Greer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2969)|
| 0:49:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Seeing no further light, you ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| We need a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| I'll make a motion, Mr. Mayor, to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| The motion is to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2982)|
| 0:49:43| Any further discussion of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2986)|
| 0:49:47| All those in favor of denying the appeal, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2989)|
| 0:49:50| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2990)|
| 0:49:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| I heard eight ayes and one no from Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| The appeal is denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=2997)|
| 0:50:03| 11A is a resolution authorizing the acquisition by condemnation, if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| of a fee simple interest in certain property located at 611 Gill Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| believed to be owned by Shirley Ann Amos at an estimated cost of $32,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| as recommended by the Chronic Problem Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3022)|
| 0:50:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| I had a conversation with Ms. Rojero earlier today, and I wanted to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| I think it was here we were talking about some follow-up from the workshop last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| week that's coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| I haven't slept since then, but my brain is very fried about what we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| I was going to ask you something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3048)|
| 0:50:54| Was it just an update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3054)|
| 0:50:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3055)|
| 0:50:56| I'm glad one of us can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| Very good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3060)|
| 0:51:01| Can you update us on what's happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3061)|
| 0:51:03| I think this is related to this and the workshop we had last week and the article in the paper today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3063)|
| 0:51:09| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3069)|
| 0:51:15| Yeah, we can't somehow hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| I don't know if.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Do you mind going to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| Madeline Rojero, Director of Community Development for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| This property that you're going to vote on to give us the approval to acquire is one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3097)|
| 0:51:43| chronic problem properties, and it's part of the discussion that we had at the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| workshop recently on vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| And I was just sharing with Vice Mayor Becker that since that meeting, we've had quite a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| things happen that we wanted to update you on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| First of all, some staff from codes, from community development, codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| community development, and the law department met with our municipal court judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| John Rawson, and he has agreed to establish a codes court so that we can, certain days will be set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3132)|
| 0:52:21| aside certain times so that we can, codes can bring all of the codes-related issues that the judge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| has to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3148)|
| 0:52:31| At one time, it will expedite the process so that we can keep our inspectors out in the field for most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3151)|
| 0:52:38| of the day and not have to sit around and wait for each individual case to come up and waste a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| their time. It also helps when neighbors need to come down and want to testify about different problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3165)|
| 0:52:51| related to whatever the structures are of the properties that are being brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| So it will expedite the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Also, you all had asked when codes would be bringing some of the suggested ordinance changes that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3178)|
| 0:53:07| listed as what we were hoping to get, and we anticipate bringing those back two weeks from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3187)|
| 0:53:16| Director King and David Brace will be bringing those. We're working with the law on that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| And then finally, the law department is also preparing a memo for Judge Rawson and for the codes department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| that will lay out the process to be followed so that we can, the courts can assess that $50 a day for multiple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3209)|
| 0:53:40| We had had some discussion about, been sort of unclear across the state on what was allowed, and the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| has looked into that, and it's going to be clearly delineated so the judge can assess multiple days of the $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| So just wanted to update you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3235)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you very much, Madeline. Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3237)|
| 0:53:59| Yeah, I just wanted to say, Madeline, it looks like, if anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3239)|
| 0:54:04| we're extraordinarily overpatient with some of these problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| I'm looking at the series of citations and violations that go back to 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3248)|
| 0:54:16| and I know we're giving the property owner every chance we can to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| but it's obvious that we probably need to even get tougher than we have been in terms of moving these things along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3261)|
| 0:54:30| because they do drag down the neighborhood, and I'm thrilled that you're doing this one. I think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3270)|
| 0:54:36| Right. And you'll notice that by the time the property gets to chronic problem properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| which is where we actually have the resources to purchase the properties, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| I think one of the things that I hope became clear through the workshop and through the articles in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| the only way to really change the worst cases is to have an ownership change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| because even a property, as many times as codes can go out and they can cite them for violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3299)|
| 0:55:07| those charges can go up, up, up, but ultimately, if the ownership doesn't change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3307)|
| 0:55:13| or if the property's been abandoned, it doesn't matter how many times you cite them, something's still not going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| and that's where the resources that you all, that the mayor and you all provide to the chronic problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| through the chronic problem properties fund, allows us to actually go in and purchase, like this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3324)|
| 0:55:30| Once we were able to get this property on the chronic problem properties committee, the 611 Gill, it took about a year to bring it through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| to where we are now able to bring it to you, and that's because of all of the due process that has to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3337)|
| 0:55:46| with going to the Better Building Board, getting the determination of blight, getting the certification of blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3346)|
| 0:55:52| In this case, we also had a little bit of delay because the property was in the bankruptcy proceedings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3352)|
| 0:55:57| The lawyers that we use, KCDC's lawyers, they went to the bankruptcy court and asked that the bankruptcy court pull this out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3357)|
| 0:56:09| individual's assets. There's an automatic stay until you get that lifted from the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| Right. And so every one of these properties has its own story, every one of these has its own difficulties, and it's just a matter of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3374)|
| 0:56:20| like codes working, and then getting it to a point where we get it to chronic problem properties. Kathy Ellis, who just has to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3380)|
| 0:56:29| issue by issue through to get it to this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| But we are, the reason we put the vacant properties committee together last year was to have a concerted interdepartmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3396)|
| 0:56:42| and intergovernmental process to try and get tougher and move these things faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| Right. And I'm not trying to be critical. What I'm saying is I think we're almost overly patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| I'm glad to see us take the initiative and go after these properties, because they will drag the neighbors down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| We agree with you, absolutely, and that's why we really appreciate the support we're getting from council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| Thank you. Okay. Ready to vote then? All those in favor, aye. Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| 11B is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville to negotiate and accept from T&A Partners LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| payments in lieu of ad valorem tax with respect to properties located at 100-105 South Gay Street and 300-410 West Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3440)|
| 0:57:29| Move to approve. Second. Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3449)|
| 0:57:35| I'd like to ask Mr. Wetzel if he would just come forward for some of the new council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3455)|
| 0:57:41| and just briefly describe, you know, what the pilot program is and how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| We'd be happy to do that. Thanks for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| Pilot program is obviously what it stands for. It's for a payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| And the way the program works is the property owner or the developer takes his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| The Industrial Development Board approves the action that you all are requesting to take tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| The Industrial Development Board will take ownership of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| And then the developers or the owners of the building will pay a payment in lieu of taxes, some to them that will be set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| And all these have a particular number to them for a particular term for the next 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3497)|
| 0:58:22| Before we get to this process where we are tonight, we've been through a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| rigorous process with chronic problem properties. This has been, most of these have been through a three to six month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| before it gets here tonight. But the basic goal is to freeze the taxes at the current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| at the pre-development level, and so that development can get done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| and the project properly cash flows itself after the development has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| And I can go into a lot more detail if you want. So feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| Yes. First of all, I'm excited about the next three items on the agenda as far as the pilot program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| and what it has done for downtown. But I would like to ask Mr. Dewhurst what projects that he has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| where he's used the pilot project to date, program to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3542)|
| 0:59:12| And thank you, Mr. Dewhurst. David, if you'd give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3552)|
| 0:59:17| David Dewhurst, 531 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3557)|
| 0:59:22| Can you ask me that again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| First of all, we appreciate what you've done for downtown. What projects have you used the pilot on to date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| Which ones have you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3572)|
| 0:59:37| The pilot program on the Emporium building at 100 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| That was seven years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| And I think that along with the Sturkey building were the first two significant residential developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| that we started in some of the old vacant warehouses downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| The only other one was when we were starting development of Market Square years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| and we used it on part of the old Watson's department store when that was transitioning at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3605)|
| 1:00:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| Okay. Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| Thank you, Mayor. Mr. Wetzel, if you could, in talking about the process here, this goes through city staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| and city authority source. Can you kind of explain who that is and who evaluates this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| Let me just walk you just real quickly through the process and then get to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| We receive a written application from people who want to pursue a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| We've had a lot of conversations this year about both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| We've ended up with three actual written requests for these documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| Staff in our office works with staff in the Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| and Kim Henry is here tonight from the Industrial Development Board to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| So we try to work through and try to get to what we think is a manageable project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| a project that makes sense for both the public and for the private developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3669)|
| 1:01:14| Then that project is taken to an executive staff review of both the city and county executive staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3674)|
| 1:01:19| to see what their questions are and ask some questions at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| And then if we're still good at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| then we send it out to a bank or a third-party reviewer to look at the pro forma to see what they think about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3684)|
| 1:01:30| And each of these three that are in front of you tonight got the standard when these things go out to these bankers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| They look at them. They do a lot of good work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3696)|
| 1:01:39| They send us back a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| But the conclusion is always, even with this public assistance, these are risky projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3701)|
| 1:01:47| and they would not go forward without this type of public assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3707)|
| 1:01:50| It would not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| So these projects have answered the question, is there a gap that we need to fill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| The answer is probably yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Is there a public benefit that they're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| The public benefit is clearly historic preservation, downtown revitalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| and putting feet on the streets in downtown Knoxville, which is what we're trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| Well, I just wanted to hear you go through that, because in the past we've done these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3729)|
| 1:02:13| and in my view this has been one of the reasons why the downtown has been done so well and is on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| And sometimes people will say, well, you know, are you giving one developer an unfair advantage over another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3740)|
| 1:02:27| And this wouldn't go through a traditional loan process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| So we give them a TIF or a pilot, and it makes it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3751)|
| 1:02:37| So we take something basically that is generating little or no tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3757)|
| 1:02:42| and eventually we'll have quite a considerable amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| And, in fact, looking back and doing a little research for it tonight, David mentioned the emporium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| It was 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| So 2013, which is not far off, we had a building that was generating almost no taxes at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3772)|
| 1:02:58| It's right at $4 million right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| At the time it was done it was probably at $100,000 max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3782)|
| 1:03:06| And that time period from 2013, that kicks in because of wise decisions of this council in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3786)|
| 1:03:12| and this administration from now to 2025, you're going to have these things rolling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| These things are going to start rolling into the tax roll, which will be a great benefit to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Mr. DelBofe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| Well, I just wanted to comment on this, because I know that, like Mr. Bailey was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| sometimes there's criticism of our using these tax incentives as part of the development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3811)|
| 1:03:39| But you look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| We have two old buildings that are underutilized and having some major work done to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3820)|
| 1:03:47| There's a $10 million investment based on the cash flow analysis that's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| That's something you can see online if you're at home by going to the agenda item and clicking on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| But you will see that there's a $7.6 million mortgage, an owner's equity of $2.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| and they've then cobbled together some federal grant money for facade funding and historic tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3844)|
| 1:04:13| And without that, we wouldn't get the finished product, which is a revitalized downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| So it's important to realize that kind of a lot of hands making these things happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| but at the end of the day, we get a vibrant downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| We get people that are living downtown that spend money, generate sales taxes and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| and the property taxes, as you said, eventually come back at the roll at a much higher rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| So this is a way of the city kind of lifting itself up by its bootstraps, and it's a wise investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3876)|
| 1:04:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3883)|

| 1:05:06| Mr. Gregg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| A question for Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| Also, again, just for the matter of record, who is the Five Torrey Hills LLC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3910)|
| 1:05:15| Five Torrey Hills LLC, there's, well, Mr. John Campbell is an attorney from Los Angeles who has been a primary owner of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3915)|

| 1:05:26| It's also Brown, Brown and West Real Estate, some principals in that farm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| And they're represented by Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| And if you all have any questions more on that, I would turn that over to Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3931)|

| 1:06:04| Again, just for the matter of record, who are these folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3964)|

| 1:06:16| and kind of go to the part where they all go to the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil101130?start=3976)|
