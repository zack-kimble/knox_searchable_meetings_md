| 0:03:44| Detective Cole, then, I'm at the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=224)|
| 0:03:46| I'm surprised you would complain against me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=226)|
| 0:03:50| for being underage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| And if you had a chance to say anything you want to this beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| and then this beer board will convene in front of you and tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=238)|
| 0:04:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| On 1-31-2022 at approximately 1949 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=251)|
| 0:04:15| detectives with the Knox County Sheriff's Office organized retail crime unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| conducted an underage beer sale investigation at a Knox County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| The arrestee is a bartender at the Embassy Suites located at 9621 Parkside Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| and was working when the underage person entered the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| The underage person sat at the bar and ordered a Blue Moon beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=271)|
| 0:04:35| and showed the arrestee his ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| After seeing his identification, the arrestee stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| you look like a young one, and sold him the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=281)|
| 0:04:46| Are you sure you understand the allegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| You admit or deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Admit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| Anything else you'd like to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| No, I do believe that the bartender in question appeared before court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| I suppose a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| and was given the opportunity to redo her bar license or liquor serving permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=304)|
| 0:05:11| which in my understanding she has 90 days to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=311)|
| 0:05:18| We at the property take it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=318)|
| 0:05:21| I personally have made sure that she understands that if she does not have it completed in 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| she will no longer be employed by us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Is that all you have to say at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| In addition to prevent this from happening in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| we also, as a matter of fact, as soon as that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| I think the very next day we went out and purchased an ID card reader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Unfortunately, it's one that wasn't compatible with our software system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| so we're in the market for looking at finding something that would work as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| So everyone has been sort of brought up to speed as far as my bartenders and servers are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| to make sure that they're following proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| As a matter of fact, that's why they've got a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| That's why they're getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| So we are doing whatever needs to be done to make sure that this doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=370)|

| 0:06:29| The penalty, the fine would be fine, would be very acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=389)|
| 0:06:32| Okay, I make a motion, $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| I have a first by Commissioner Smith and a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=397)|

| 0:09:30| And he's been counseled about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| and placed on a probationary period of less responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| until he can establish he's able to handle the tasks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| including the proper sale of alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=578)|

| 0:10:22| where it reads the IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| so that it won't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=625)|

| 0:14:08| Are you talking about sitting up there behind the Harley Davidson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=852)|

| 0:14:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Right next to the stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Director Book, I don't know if any of this matters one way or the other, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| Will you just be, like, selling off of a picnic table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| We'll have portable bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=870)|
| 0:14:31| We have a food truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| Not a food truck, but a food trader that's there full-time, seven days, 24 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=873)|
| 0:14:39| And we'll be using that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I'll be serving lunch during the day eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| I don't want it to be just a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| I'm not about that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| So we want to be able to have all – there's so many businesses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| That area is booming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| So we want to give the neighborhoods something to come to and enjoy themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| And it's going to end up being more like a beer garden with good food and live entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| Just something nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Then there wouldn't be reports from all those places because there's not a physical structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| to evaluate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| Does any of that make any difference in applying for the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=909)|
| 0:15:13| Well, the law is a little vague on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| It sounds like they're on a property with a building there, Harley-Davidson, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=916)|
| 0:15:23| Well, we're right behind – it's actually two separate properties, but yes, sir, we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| And the building there that you're going to be, as it were, attached to is a Harley-Davidson building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=927)|
| 0:15:34| Well, we're not really attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| I didn't mean it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=936)|
| 0:15:38| Physically, I meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| We will be working events with the Harley-Davidson, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| My question is if you're having an event there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| will they be using the facilities and the restrooms at the Harley-Davidson building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| Well, we have those available, but we also have a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| they just bought a $100,000 bathroom that sits on the property also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=956)|
| 0:16:03| The health department's been out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| They inspected the food truck and the bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=964)|
| 0:16:06| We've been through all the inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| I don't want to have an indoor bar set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=969)|
| 0:16:13| so I would rather have the portable bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| We're going to have a 1,000-pound ice machine so we can just pour them around and move them where we have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| do what we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=980)|
| 0:16:22| Most people I know would rather have a beer off ice than they would out of a cooler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=982)|
| 0:16:25| so I'm just trying to make people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=985)|
| 0:16:29| Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=989)|

| 0:16:31| I believe I understand what you're planning to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=991)|
| 0:16:36| I have no objection in offering a promotion to accept this application for the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=996)|

| 0:16:48| Just a clerical, I believe the zip code there is 37932, not 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| It's Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1018)|

| 0:17:09| It's Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| It's not 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| 22 would be my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1031)|
| 0:17:17| 37934, I believe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| No, that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| It would be 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| Just put it in the Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1044)|

| 0:17:26| Yeah, it's on the other side of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| 32 doesn't go that side of the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1049)|
| 0:17:31| I'm saying for clerical reasons, make sure we're assigning to the proper address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1051)|
| 0:17:40| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1060)|

| 0:17:45| I believe that's what the health permit says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1065)|
| 0:17:50| If you put the address in the Google.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1070)|

| 0:18:22| I've never had to use the scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| We tried it in one of my clubs, and it just didn't work out specifically right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1107)|
| 0:18:32| If we have a problem in the future, I might try that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1112)|

| 0:19:11| After the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| It won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Just a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1155)|
| 0:19:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| We're going to move on to the other business portion of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| Last month, we talked about the opportunity to put the people who have passed the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| stings online as well as on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| And I've been meeting with Zach Webb about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| And we're actually going to take that into account and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| I would like to get the commission's opinion on what they would like to see in the style| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| of it on the agenda as well as online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Do you want a full list or a link to click to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| So I'm open for suggestions if anybody has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| I think it could just be spread a record on the beer board agenda like we do spread a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| record for anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| For the website, I think it just should be if you click on beer board, then they should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| just drop down right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| And then also, I think Commissioner Jay recommended that we list the people who have been checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| that got the A+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| That's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| So it's the providers and the ones who did it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Totally separate topic, but while we're on the beer board, I wanted to see if anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| would have objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| It seems like every single month we talk about the card readers and everybody sort of retroactively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| goes, oh, I got to get one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| I got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| And, you know, it's technology could probably solve a lot of proactive issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| And I wonder if anybody has objection for me to reach out to the Metro Drug Coalition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| and just maybe see if they would put together a flyer or something so when somebody pulls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| a beer permit, do we have anything in there about this type of technology that could just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1255)|
| 0:21:01| go in the packet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Do we have anything in there now that sort of says, hey, here's some tools to help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| I have packets that I give out from the Metro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Left a couple packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| It's got different stuff in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Does it have anything about card readers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| I don't know if it says card readers, but there's some more cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| I guess it tells if you put your ID in there, how you can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| I'm not sure, but we have packets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| But Ashton's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| They do have a resource sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| Could you approach the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1291)|
| 0:21:33| I mean, it's not for us to require that everybody get them, but it seems like if we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| about 90% less violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1303)|

| 0:21:55| There's one of the sheets in the packet actually has a lot of resources and tips for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| who are going to be applying for their licenses, and it talks about scanners on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1320)|

| 0:22:12| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1332)|

| 0:22:15| Hey, a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1335)|
| 0:22:17| The businesses that we do stop at that are in compliance, do they get notification like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| they're doing a good job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| That's what we're talking about doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| So last month we were talking about putting them on the website so the citizens of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| County could see that they have been checked and they passed and kind of a pat on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| for doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| I mean, do they get like a letter or certificate for the business to show that they are being compliant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1357)|
| 0:22:50| Do you mean like a letter that says, hey, you were checked on this date and by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| you guys passed, good job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| Metro actually sends out letters to both people who have failed and people who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1376)|
| 0:23:02| passed compliance checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| I'm not sure what's in those letters, but I know that we send those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| I'm not sure if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| No, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| It's a tremendous help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| Is there any way that you could send us a letter of the ones that passed just so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| could see what it says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1397)|

| 0:23:22| Is there a way that people filling out the application for the beer permit could do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| online so that it's much easier to read as opposed to where they're just scribbling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1407)|
| 0:23:35| down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Do we still have that set up to where they can do it online and then submit it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| We can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| I said I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I've never seen anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| The only thing I've seen is paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| We probably need to get with our IT people to see if that application is online to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220425-beer-board?start=1431)|
