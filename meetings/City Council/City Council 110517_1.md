| 2:41:13| And I kind of, I even made the second here because I thought fireworks were illegal in the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9673)|
| 2:41:20| But, you know, it seems to me like more regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9680)|
| 2:41:23| I think, you know, it seems to me that, you know, this is a responsibility of adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9683)|
| 2:41:29| and supervision over their children and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| But I'll hear my colleagues out, and we'll have a majority vote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9692)|
| 2:41:40| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9700)|
| 2:41:42| Chief Roush, if there were a situation where the Knoxville Police Department were called upon to enforce this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9702)|
| 2:41:47| the consequence would be the usual municipal $50 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9711)|
| 2:41:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9712)|
| 2:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9713)|
| 2:41:54| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9714)|
| 2:41:55| Yeah, I'm just wondering, I don't know if we have anyone that's actually engaged in the sale of fireworks within the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9715)|
| 2:42:01| as opposed to in the county or elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9721)|
| 2:42:03| Are we putting anybody out of business by this ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9723)|
| 2:42:05| I mean, are there consequences we haven't foreseen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9725)|
| 2:42:08| Obviously the main intent is let's not start a fire with fireworks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9728)|
| 2:42:11| or let's not have a nuisance by some idiots firing stuff off at 1 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9731)|
| 2:42:15| and waking up the entire neighborhood because it's Fourth of July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| Yeah, they're already not allowed to sell them, not only in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| but they can't sell them in the county at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9741)|
| 2:42:23| Okay, so we're not going to affect any business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9743)|
| 2:42:25| That's not the problem, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9745)|
| 2:42:27| And what do you say about the little girl with the birthday candles, so to speak, the birthday sparklers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9747)|
| 2:42:33| Well, birthday candles are not illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9753)|
| 2:42:35| Sparklers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9755)|
| 2:42:36| Sparklers, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| Again, I guess don't invite a police officer to your birthday party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9759)|
| 2:42:44| Well, I mean, you know, that's ironic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9764)|
| 2:42:47| But, I mean, the thought is if you make something illegal that doesn't make sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9767)|
| 2:42:52| people lose respect for the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9772)|
| 2:42:54| And I don't mean to minimize my comment, but that was my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9774)|
| 2:42:58| And I could see, you know, some dad and a little kid on Fourth of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9778)|
| 2:43:02| setting off a pack of fireworks in the backyard at 5 in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9782)|
| 2:43:06| We actually debated about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9786)|
| 2:43:08| You know, we went with the classification, the 1.4G, the common fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9788)|
| 2:43:13| Sparklers happened to be included in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9793)|
| 2:43:15| We debated about whether or not we wanted to add that as one of the exclusions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9795)|
| 2:43:19| like we did toy caps and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9799)|
| 2:43:23| And, you know, we decided not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9803)|
| 2:43:25| Obviously, you can amend that if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9805)|
| 2:43:27| although there are a lot of statistics with children playing with sparklers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| and getting very serious injuries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9811)|
| 2:43:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9814)|
| 2:43:35| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9815)|
| 2:43:37| Officer McGreeve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9817)|
| 2:43:38| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9818)|
| 2:43:39| Right now fireworks are not illegal in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9819)|
| 2:43:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9822)|
| 2:43:43| That would be correct since the adoption of the new fire prevention code a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9823)|
| 2:43:48| The public perception, of course, is that they are still illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9828)|
| 2:43:51| Well, I was just going to say, I know in my neighborhood Fourth of July is a lot of fireworks go off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9831)|
| 2:43:57| Well celebrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9837)|
| 2:43:59| Yeah, well celebrated is a better way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9839)|
| 2:44:01| So can those folks get a permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9841)|
| 2:44:05| Or are we just passing a law just to have it on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| and you're not going to worry about Fourth of July and New Year's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| No, we would start a public information campaign right away once this is passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| You can still have fireworks, but you have to get a permit through the fire marshal's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9858)|
| 2:44:23| and there are very significant restrictions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| It really limits it to professional displays of fireworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9866)|
| 2:44:30| and not just someone doing it in their backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| I guess the thing that intrigues me is that supposedly a lot of us have thought that fireworks were illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| That is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9879)|
| 2:44:41| And the celebrations that have gone on doesn't seem to matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9881)|
| 2:44:46| and so I don't know why this is going to make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9886)|
| 2:44:51| Well, I know the police department, and we do too, get a lot of complaints on the Fourth of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9891)|
| 2:44:57| and Labor Day and New Year's Eve for people shooting off fireworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9897)|
| 2:45:01| and disturbing or starting fires or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9901)|
| 2:45:04| So, I mean, that's what's really prompted this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9904)|
| 2:45:07| How many of those people have been given citations at those different times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9907)|
| 2:45:12| Currently, we don't cite at all because it's not illegal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9912)|
| 2:45:19| We respond to the calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9919)|
| 2:45:22| Because we get such a large volume on those occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9922)|
| 2:45:27| typically it's a property check where the officers will ride through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9927)|
| 2:45:34| The thing we point out to the officers is if they see someone acting irresponsibly, dangerously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9934)|
| 2:45:40| then they need to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9940)|
| 2:45:43| And there's other ways you can address that other than this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9943)|
| 2:45:47| Disorderly conduct, the noise ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9947)|
| 2:45:51| There are some other ordinances that are there that help us address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9951)|
| 2:45:56| But the main intent, I think, of this is to kind of tighten up where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9956)|
| 2:46:02| as Chief Sharpe and I have talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9962)|
| 2:46:04| it tightens up the area where everybody thought already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| And it was in existence until a couple of years ago when the fire code was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9968)|
| 2:46:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9977)|
| 2:46:20| I think we have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9980)|
| 2:46:23| Mayor, I'm just going to say, I think we've got enough ordinances in place to cover this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9983)|
| 2:46:27| And I think this is a personal responsibility issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| And I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9990)|
| 2:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9996)|
| 2:46:37| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9997)|
| 2:46:38| I'm going to go along with Councilman Bailey, Mr. Mayor, on this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=9998)|
| 2:46:42| And echo just what you said, Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| I would agree, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10005)|
| 2:46:47| It may be a little problem, but I don't think it's such a big problem we have to legislate on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10007)|
| 2:46:51| It's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10011)|
| 2:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| Well, Councilman Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| My experience in living in Mechanicsville is that it's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10020)|
| 2:47:06| And it gets out of control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10026)|
| 2:47:10| It's been my experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10030)|
| 2:47:11| And in defaulting to the parental piece, I don't think that's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10031)|
| 2:47:22| So I'm going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10042)|
| 2:47:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10046)|
| 2:47:27| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10047)|
| 2:47:30| Y'all want to do a roll call vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10050)|
| 2:47:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10053)|
| 2:47:34| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10054)|
| 2:47:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10056)|
| 2:47:38| Councilman Dela Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10058)|
| 2:47:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10059)|
| 2:47:40| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10062)|
| 2:47:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10063)|
| 2:47:44| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10064)|
| 2:47:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10065)|
| 2:47:46| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10069)|
| 2:47:50| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10070)|
| 2:47:51| It's your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10071)|
| 2:47:53| It's your neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10073)|
| 2:47:55| This was the lobby one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10075)|
| 2:47:59| No lobbying, huh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10079)|
| 2:48:00| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10080)|
| 2:48:02| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10082)|
| 2:48:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10083)|
| 2:48:04| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10084)|
| 2:48:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10085)|
| 2:48:06| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10086)|
| 2:48:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10087)|
| 2:48:10| It fell three to six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10090)|
| 2:48:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| 12D is an ordinance to close Tillery Street from Fountain Road right-of-way to approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10096)|
| 2:48:21| 350 feet northwest to corner of tax parcel 058BF013 subject to certain conditions and authorizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10101)|
| 2:48:27| the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's Ralph Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| slash PLS applicant fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10111)|
| 2:48:34| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10114)|
| 2:48:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10115)|
| 2:48:36| It's been moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10116)|
| 2:48:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10117)|
| 2:48:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10118)|
| 2:48:39| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10119)|
| 2:48:40| Oh, I'm sorry, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10122)|
| 2:48:43| Are you here to speak on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10123)|
| 2:48:45| I'm the applicant and I was wondering if we could get that approved on emergency or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| if we need to come back to the second meeting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10128)|
| 2:48:51| Well, we didn't vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10131)|
| 2:48:54| We didn't finish voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10134)|
| 2:48:55| I don't know how it's going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10135)|
| 2:48:57| Is that going to be approved on emergency if you're voting for it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10137)|
| 2:49:01| Not unless it gets amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10141)|
| 2:49:02| It would be up in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10142)|
| 2:49:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10143)|
| 2:49:06| I'd be glad to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10146)|
| 2:49:07| You know the answer to this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10147)|
| 2:49:09| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10149)|
| 2:49:10| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| It only passes on emergency if they amend it to make it an emergency measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10151)|
| 2:49:15| And that's not what that is, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10155)|
| 2:49:17| It has not been, there's been no motion to amend it to emergency at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10157)|
| 2:49:24| I'd like to request that if anybody would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10164)|
| 2:49:27| The only reason for that is, and it's not critical by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10167)|
| 2:49:31| but we started this project in February so that we could get on the April MPC meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| and we're probably not looking at finishing it at least until the first week of June right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10177)|
| 2:49:42| And this is a conditional closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10182)|
| 2:49:44| I'm sure the city and county would both like to finish it up because the resub can't be completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| until the right-of-way closure is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| And the right-of-way closure can't be done until the resub is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10193)|
| 2:49:56| So we're kind of in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10196)|
| 2:49:58| And it would really be good to be able to take two weeks out of the process and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10198)|
| 2:50:02| Sir, let me ask you to identify yourself, your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10202)|

| 2:50:17| And this is like several neighbors adjoining a paper road that doesn't exist in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10217)|
| 2:50:22| So I don't have any problem with asking that it be approved on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10222)|
| 2:50:28| Just get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10228)|

| 2:55:57| And I'm asking the council tonight to act on this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10557)|
| 2:56:02| I don't think there's any opposition from anyone, but I would ask that that be the first part of the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10562)|
| 2:56:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10569)|
| 2:56:10| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10570)|
| 2:56:11| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10571)|
| 2:56:12| I'd like to ask Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10572)|
| 2:56:13| I noticed that the piece of property that they're asking to go from C6 to C3, there's additional property on the hill that is C6, but the property across and to the west is C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10573)|
| 2:56:25| Is there some talk that maybe that other C6 property will be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10585)|
| 2:56:31| Is there a look at what's happening on Bearden Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10591)|
| 2:56:35| We have not heard any discussion about that, nor have we initiated any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10595)|
| 2:56:42| We're in favor of this amendment because it kind of removes a little appendage of C6 that was kind of freestanding and consolidates the C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10602)|
| 2:56:53| We haven't heard anything about removing C6 on the balance of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10613)|
| 2:56:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10617)|
| 2:56:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10618)|
| 2:57:01| I would like to add that we approve this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10621)|
| 2:57:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10627)|
| 2:57:08| Amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10631)|
| 2:57:12| All in favor of approving the amendment on emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10632)|
| 2:57:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10637)|
| 2:57:18| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10640)|
| 2:57:22| Now we need to vote on the ordinance as emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10642)|
| 2:57:28| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10648)|
| 2:57:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| Ayes have it, so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| Is that an oh like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10652)|
| 2:57:33| Yeah, well, I'd just like to thank you for staying the entire evening to be last on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10653)|
| 2:57:39| You deserve this on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| Well, I would also like to thank the members of the city council for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10660)|
| 2:57:46| I don't think most of the citizens in this county really realize and in the city how much time it takes to be on council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10666)|
| 2:57:54| how many meetings you have, and how many telephone calls you have to ferret during the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10674)|
| 2:58:01| and the amount of time that it takes to be a member of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10681)|
| 2:58:05| And we appreciate your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| I know all of you on this council, and I know how hard you work, and I do appreciate your efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10687)|
| 2:58:13| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10695)|
| 2:58:19| We have one person signed up for public forum, Rachel Craig.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10699)|
| 2:58:29| Y'all don't shoot me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10709)|
| 2:58:30| I promise to be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10710)|
| 2:58:31| Rachel Craig, 2222 Allen Home Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10711)|
| 2:58:35| First of all, I want to compliment you on your actions tonight on the Hillside Ridgetop Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10715)|
| 2:58:41| While I would have preferred that you go ahead and approve it in first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| I really applaud your leadership in taking the initiative to work with the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10725)|
| 2:58:51| and to see if there's a consensus to be come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10731)|
| 2:58:54| And I wanted to tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10734)|
| 2:58:56| While I have you all as a captive audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| I also wanted to express a bit of a concern I have about the process you're about to engage in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10739)|
| 2:59:08| and that is I think it's great to work and see if you can collaborate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10748)|
| 2:59:14| and to see if you can come to consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| I mean, I served on the South Waterfront Oversight Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| I've been through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10759)|
| 2:59:20| I know that can be done, and it's important to try to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10760)|
| 2:59:25| However, I would caution you about compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10765)|
| 2:59:30| That word always makes me nervous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10770)|
| 2:59:32| because a lot of times what we mean by compromise is we have position A, we have position B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10772)|
| 2:59:39| we'll just split the difference down the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10779)|
| 2:59:42| And that doesn't always get us a good product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10782)|
| 2:59:45| as the story of King Solomon and splitting the baby reminds us what we ended up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10785)|
| 2:59:53| In that case, it was with a dead baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10793)|
| 2:59:56| So I just want to caution you that as you go through this process, when you look at making changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10796)|
| 3:00:05| be sure that there are solid reasons and rationale behind the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10805)|
| 3:00:11| and that they're not being made just because they're halfway in between,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10811)|
| 3:00:15| because I just don't think that gets you to a good product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10815)|
| 3:00:19| And that's the only concern I have about this process going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10819)|
| 3:00:23| Again, I want to congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| I think you all showed great leadership tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10827)|
| 3:00:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10829)|
| 3:00:30| Thank you, Ms. Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10830)|
| 3:00:31| We are now dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10831)|
| 3:00:32| Thanks, Peter Conn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil110517?start=10832)|
