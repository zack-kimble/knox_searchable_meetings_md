| 0:05:17| thing is what it does culturally. It's going to connect a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=317)|

| 0:06:14| it was in writing in one document or another. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=374)|

| 0:06:22| we can. But I think this provides a summary of some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=382)|

| 0:21:24| heard and have kept in mind as we have went through our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1284)|

| 0:21:44| we've done thus far. You heard Mr. Boyd speak about a Turnkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1304)|

| 0:22:48| transportation needs. There has been a parking study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1368)|

| 0:22:58| multimodal transportation, and we also have a development here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| that creates foot traffic, so we want to make sure that we maximize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| that foot traffic. And finally, plan for future capital needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| We heard that at our last meeting, and so what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| That means a capital improvements reserve, which you received on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1397)|

| 0:23:25| capital needs. Going to the next slide, looking at stadium costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1405)|
| 0:23:33| this was presented back in August. This has not changed since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| August, meaning that the total cost of the stadium is $80.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1417)|
| 0:23:44| million, of which 74.3 is publicly funded, and the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1424)|
| 0:23:51| Mr. Boyd, is picking up the $5.8 million of the increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| And so this number has not changed. You will see there that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| got a contingency in there of about $7.25 million, and so we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1438)|
| 0:24:05| into contingency a little bit later on, but that is built in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| this amount. But our maximum exposure is $74.5 million as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1450)|
| 0:24:18| sits right now. And at that point, I will turn it over to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1461)|
| 0:24:27| I know that you all have seen this slide effectively now. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| will be the third time. It is very much the same as it was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| the last workshop. The only change really was that the top number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| 74.3, is down $200,000 because we got a slightly more precise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| estimate of the construction budget. So that chart has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| changed. One thing I realized after I appeared before you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| last time is that the chart is somewhat confusing, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| apologize for that, but it's hard to explain the annual debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1494)|
| 0:24:58| service and how it compares to this chart. Keep in mind that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| annual debt service, if we do $65 million of bonds, that's like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| your mortgage payment per year if you have a house is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| $3.2 million. That number has not changed in any material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| respect since in the last two months. So the number I gave you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1515)|
| 0:25:18| all last time I went here, $3.2 million a year, is still about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1518)|
| 0:25:21| the same number. You said, well, why is that number not up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| Because it doesn't tell the whole story, and it's hard to tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| the whole story without this type of analysis, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| because the sales tax revenues from the stadium are expected to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| increase dramatically over the 30-year period. If you looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| it in the first year, that's where there's a shortfall. By the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| end of 30 years, just based on inflation and cost of goods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| going up and hopefully some growth of the stadium, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| experts that we hired to do it project that the sales tax alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| by the end of that period will be $2.3 million. So just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| sales tax increment off the stadium by the time we get toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| the latter years, we'll almost be paying for the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| itself. But that is misleading to you all to say, oh, we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| good shape. That sales tax, you have to look at it over a period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| of time. So the best way, in my judgment, to look at it is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| way, to say, okay, this stadium is going to cost us $74.3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| million of public funds. So, again, I think the home mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| I hope is a helpful example. So your granddad wants you to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| a nice house. He says, you know what, I'll give you $13.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| million for your down payment. That's your equity in it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| we're giving to you. It doesn't come out of city, county funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| at all. It comes out again. And that gets you down to the $60.8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1595)|
| 0:26:40| million after you've made your down payment. Don't pay any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| interest on that. That's your down payment. That's what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| borrowing for your house. That would be like what your mortgage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| loan would be for in this case. But, of course, there's always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1609)|

| 0:26:58| hand out when you do the financing. And then you've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| pay interest while the project is under construction. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1622)|
| 0:27:05| don't want to take that out of the city and county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| because it's not revenue generating yet. So when you add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| those two items back in, you really need to borrow $65 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| which is the same figure, roughly, that we showed last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1634)|
| 0:27:17| So now we have a mortgage of $65 million. That's what you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1637)|
| 0:27:20| out and, again, mortgage is a little bit, there's no lien on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| the baseball stadium. I'm just using that as an example of how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| we're borrowing like a house, a home mortgage loan. So then you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| say, okay, well, how am I going to pay the annual debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| on that $65 million? So the first thing is the sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1655)|
| 0:27:39| revenues. As I said, it starts at $900,000, according to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| experts' estimates, and goes up to about $2.3 million. So what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| will that pay for if, again, say Aunt Betsy came to you and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1666)|

| 0:27:55| start giving you some more money. So I'm going to go borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| against what Aunt Betsy's going to give me. How much can I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| borrow against that? Well, that's $28.2 million. So that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| the present value of that income stream is roughly $28.2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1685)|

| 0:28:16| Most of that, two-thirds of that comes from the state, a third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1696)|

| 0:29:44| what right now we could borrow against. And so, again, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| Randy mentioned before, the 30 million, that will pay $19.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| million at the cost of this stadium. And that's in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1791)|
| 0:29:55| binding. The sales tax revenues are projections. Admittedly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| We don't know. But we hired what we consider the best in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| industry to try to do that for you all. And so now we're down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1801)|
| 0:30:05| after that to $17.4 million. And then as Randy mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| what's the last source that we're hoping to use to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1809)|
| 0:30:12| It's roughly a minimum of $100 million of private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1812)|
| 0:30:15| that would go in right next door. And you'll see a site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| here in a minute, what we call buildings A, B, and C. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1818)|

| 0:30:25| actual stadium. And they're telling us right now that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1825)|
| 0:30:28| cost actually is closer to $120 million. So the incremental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| property tax revenues, all new, we have none of that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1833)|
| 0:30:37| I mean, there's probably a tiny tax on that property, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| totally de minimis. You know, tentatively, of course, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| ultimately up to your all's approval. And we'll talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| when that would come to you later. We have talked with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| about splitting the incremental. They needed to help incentivize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1851)|
| 0:30:54| their development, but we needed to help pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| We're using $750 for that number. It could be a million. It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| could be $650. But $750 is a fairly conservative estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| until we really get our assessor to look at their design. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| hope that we would have that for you all tonight. We're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| have to come back to you with that because they're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1870)|
| 0:31:12| fine-tuning it because there's a lot of demand. That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| You know, they think that development hopefully will go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| well and we will certainly have a better sense of exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| it is. But right now, it's somewhere between $100 and $120| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| million of development, of which the incremental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| revenues, which we would try to capture through either a TIF or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1889)|
| 0:31:33| a pilot, which is very similar to what they did in Nashville for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| the Sound Stadium, is about $750,000 annually. So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| that's, I don't know which uncle or aunt that is, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1901)|

| 0:31:51| another $14.5 million that we'll pay for your mortgage. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| what does that leave you with? Well, you've got to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| pay out of your pocket $2.9 million. And obviously, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| less than 3% of the cost of the stadium if you include the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1921)|
| 0:32:06| cost and things like that. And so the ultimate question that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| we're trying to present is that we're trying to negotiate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| best deal we can for this community and what we're hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| to accomplish. And, of course, some of these are estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Things can go wrong. But if things go as expected, out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1940)|

| 0:32:30| the cost of the stadium. The state, by far, is paying the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| largest cost of this stadium through the state sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| revenues and the $13.5 million that they gave us. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1956)|
| 0:32:45| Randy's paying a lot, and you could debate whether the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| incremental property tax revenues are, and not Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1968)|

| 0:32:58| development. So, again, I hope that provides a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| better explanation than I did last time. But the net, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| that equates to roughly the $240,000 a year on average of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1984)|
| 0:33:10| debt service that the city and county would share to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1990)|

| 0:33:16| compared to a lot of things that you all do. But, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| it starts larger, goes smaller. If you, from your high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2001)|

| 0:33:37| versus this revenue stream versus debt service. And so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| should be positive at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2022)|

| 0:36:05| but that's the way that you can get high-rated bonds at the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| interest rate. And again, I've talked about that in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| And so that would be, this is the, that little agreement that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| in your agenda package is essentially the agreement that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2176)|

| 0:36:23| thing, one thing that you all kept asking us, and I think it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| a great question that we had to spend a lot of time negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2186)|

| 0:36:35| to make sure you set up side of a rainy day fund. So when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2195)|

| 0:36:46| and things like that. So we looked at other comparable stadiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| and when I say we, I've got to give a lot of credit to Doug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2210)|

| 0:37:01| stuff on the Internet, but we looked at a lot of them, tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| come up with a compromise approach, and so you'll see in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2224)|

| 0:37:34| in that interlocal agreement. So it's not open-ended, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| think that was a concern some of you all had to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| you weren't committing more than what's needed, but we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| that's a reasonable capital reserve fund to keep the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| in good shape based on precedent from other jurisdictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2268)|

| 0:38:14| approval on those probably in January. We'll get to that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| later as well, but any major changes that would come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2297)|

| 0:38:28| changes are, but what we want to do is give you a draft to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| you what we had done to this point. Some of the key points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2313)|

| 0:39:21| what you have here is a turnkey development agreement, not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2361)|

| 0:39:30| development as well. A collaborative approval of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| change that will materially impact function, cost, or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| quality of the stadium, and one thing that we kept talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| last time in August and we're working on at that time was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| infrastructure, and so what you will see here today is the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| is responsible for streets and public plaza, and KUB is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| responsible for the utility infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| So you look at the stadium ownership layout, and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| just three components here. The colors on the screen probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| don't match what I'm going to say, but the pink outline in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2407)|

| 0:40:19| the lease agreement. The three yellow buildings, which we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2419)|
| 0:40:24| about as building A, B, and C, those are covered in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2424)|

| 0:40:32| around Willow and to Jackson and to Florida Street, that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| public infrastructure piece. So if you look at those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| components, that's how those are made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| And just to clarify something that Chris said, the yellow will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| be covered by the one, I talked about the three legs of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2451)|

| 0:40:59| that we do not have in front of you yet because we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| refining what that is. Again, $100 million to $120 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| but we can't really show you until we have sort of final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2464)|
| 0:41:07| schematics from them so we can present that at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| It will be very similar to development agreement we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| use for KCDC, but that we're trying to use linguistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| private development agreement versus the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| is the turnkey development agreement for the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| itself. So I just want to clarify when we use those terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| and I promise you I won't give you another long lecture on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| financing this time, but the lease agreement is the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| document that we sent you. Again, I want to emphasize that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| it, like the development agreement, the turnkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| development agreement that you got is in draft form, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| would say that, based on my experience, it's probably 95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2499)|
| 0:41:43| negotiated, that we're still beating our head back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| a little bit on 5%, but it certainly is, I think, worthy of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| public comment, I hope, and your all's input. So it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| hopefully consistent with what we've told you, which is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| 30-year lease for $1 million a year. At the end of that 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2517)|

| 0:42:04| makes sense for the community to extend it, but there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| obligation to extend it, and that was a point that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| agreed to that we really appreciated, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| who knows what it will be like 30 years from now. Again, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=2532)|

| 1:00:12| and my team together. I really want to say no to this. I mean, I really do. From the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| beginning, I wanted to say no to this. The problem is that it really makes sense, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| when you look at the advantages, when you look at the cost benefit, the benefits outweigh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| the cost. That's just a simple fact of the matter. The big risk here, and there is risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| Go forward, we all know that, and we have to accept that. We're all risk averse, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| no matter what we do, there is a risk. But the risk, as Mayor Kincannon said, the big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3641)|
| 1:00:48| risk is that we lose the potential that this brings and all the things that she listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| So as you all are making that decision, please keep that in mind. This is, I agree, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| is a really once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change a part of our community for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3661)|

| 1:01:17| that are here. And that's increasingly important as our county continues to grow and competes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| with other metropolitan areas. So just, again, thank you all for your time. Thank you, Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3684)|

| 1:01:47| do our best, Councilmembers and Commissioners, to keep the proper order as you turn your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3707)|

| 1:02:09| I'd first like to just say to Mr. Boyd, to the team from the City and the County, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| Ramenthoff, the Sports Authority, thank you for the work. So much of this goes unnoticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3736)|
| 1:02:23| and there is so much behind the scenes that has to go into even fathoming a project of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| this size, much less digging into the details. And so I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3749)|
| 1:02:36| Just one question. I'm referring to this map here and Mr. Caldwell, perhaps you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| just clarify for the public. The yellow areas are listed as privately owned. Those are part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3762)|
| 1:02:49| of the development agreement. The areas in orange are publicly owned. But the areas in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| purple, who will own that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3774)|

| 1:03:03| And who owns the Sports Authority?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| It was jointly created, equally controlled by a public instrumentality of the City and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| the County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| And ultimately that means?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| It's owned by the City and the County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| Owned by the people of the City and the County. And that's what I'm getting to. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| make sure that it's really clear. While there is private development here and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| certainly publicly owned entities, the stadium itself is also a publicly owned entity. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| it is governed by the Sports Authority that we created, but it is owned by the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3807)|
| 1:03:31| of the City of Knoxville and the County. Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| I was worried it was a trick question here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| No, it's not a trick question. I'm just trying to lead the horses here. It's just important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| to know because there's a lot of misconception and this is an asset that we, if we decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3821)|

| 1:03:54| how to move forward with it. And I just want to make sure that that's very clear. We certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3834)|

| 1:04:09| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3849)|
| 1:04:13| Thank you. I appreciate this opportunity to ask additional questions about this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3853)|
| 1:04:23| One, and I apologize for running late. I was trying to review the documents sent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3863)|
| 1:04:32| us just before the meeting, before arriving. One thing that struck me in listening to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| speakers at the beginning of the meeting, I believe Mr. Boyd stated that the pre-development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3878)|
| 1:04:48| costs that are currently being incurred would be assumed essentially by Boyd development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3888)|
| 1:05:00| R&R development. But I just wanted to clarify, it seems like there's a provision in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3900)|
| 1:05:10| agreement that allows for any financing proceeds to be divided up above the cost of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3910)|
| 1:05:22| to be divided between Boyd and the authority. So, please correct me if I'm wrong, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3922)|
| 1:05:30| seems like any pre-development cost as outlined in the development agreement, section 6.6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3930)|
| 1:05:42| referring back to section 5.3, the financing proceeds would actually be used to pay back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3942)|
| 1:05:57| Boyd. Can Lisa clarify that point quickly? Anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| Yeah, I'd be glad to clarify that point. It's a good detailed question. So, yes, we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| to incentivize the contingency not to be used. The first million would go into a capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| reserve fund. If it goes into the capital reserve fund, then that would mean that you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| not have to fund capital reserves, I can't remember exactly, six, seven, eight years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3979)|
| 1:06:23| before you'd have to put any money into the capital reserve. So, that's the highest priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| is the million dollars if there's a contingency left over. So, to incentivize the turnkey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3987)|
| 1:06:33| developer to maximize contingency, yes, the turnkey developer, what they have indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| to us, Councilman Parker, is that they intend to add more amenities to the stadium and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| use it to reimburse themselves. You're right, they're not required to do so. The four point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| million for demolition and side prep costs is not something that we are going to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4006)|
| 1:06:52| them to reimburse themselves for. There may be some of the costs in the six million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| because those are amenities, additional amenities that is shown here that they could be reimbursed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| for. That is an issue that we're still fine-tuning. As I mentioned, I would consider both these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4022)|
| 1:07:07| agreements roughly over 90 percent negotiated, but that's an issue that we've been going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4027)|
| 1:07:11| back and forth on is what exactly could they use their contingency, but it would be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4031)|
| 1:07:15| for something that would enhance the value of the stadium. But the four million roughly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| for the, that's essentially the demolition cost to clear the lot and to have it as what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4040)|
| 1:07:26| most people would call pad ready. That would not be part of what's being reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| And when you say the six million, what's included in the six million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4050)|
| 1:07:34| It's actually the exact amount used in the presentation was five point eight million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| When the cost of the stadium went up to roughly 80 million dollars when we came before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| last time, Boyd Sports or our land agreed to cover roughly, I used six million, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4063)|
| 1:07:50| roughly five point eight million of the cost of the enhancements to the stadium because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| we asked them to do as much value engineering as they could, which they were up, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| at the time it was even more than the 80 million and they looked at every opportunity at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4079)|
| 1:08:04| time to try to, based on the schematic designs, to get the cost down. And there were certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4084)|
| 1:08:11| aspects of it that they really felt would be, if removed, would be detrimental to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4091)|
| 1:08:18| high quality stadium that we wanted for our community. And they basically said we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4098)|
| 1:08:22| pay for them. It's roughly five point eight million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| Another concern I had that popped up to me is that we're discussing the timeline, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4106)|
| 1:08:36| according to the development agreement, this agreement isn't valid until Major League Baseball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4116)|
| 1:08:47| approves the move of the Smokies and the use of this potentially new stadium as their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| stadium. But it says by no later than 2024. Is there a reason why the date we get confirmation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4134)|
| 1:09:04| that they've been approved to use this as their home stadium is after essentially the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4144)|
| 1:09:12| project is set to be completed? Yeah, that's again a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Yes, we obviously wouldn't move forward unless we knew we had confirmation from Major League| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| Baseball that they're going to approve this move. It's an interesting time for us. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4161)|
| 1:09:25| going to be a little bit, as I understand it, and certainly the team can correct me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| if I misspeak, but we're going through a time of transition for Major League Baseball. As| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| you all know, they re-designated a lot of the minor league markets and decided that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| the Knoxville market was a market they wanted to make a long-term commitment to and kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| a double-A franchise here in our area. Right now, as you all well know, it's up in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4181)|
| 1:09:48| But by doing so, we will be probably the first agreement of this nature to go in front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4188)|
| 1:09:55| Major League Baseball, and so we're going to get this in front of them immediately and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| ask them to go ahead and approve this, and certainly that's a fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4199)|

| 1:10:10| I'm glad to discuss it. Every provision is important, but there is a provision in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4210)|
| 1:10:17| back about Major League Baseball and our need. They are redoing their forms for approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4217)|
| 1:10:24| minor league baseball, and so we're going to have to work through that. But no, we certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| don't expect to go until 2024. We don't want to break ground, as you rightfully point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| unless we know that they're going to permit the move of the team to Knoxville. It obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| would not make sense to do so otherwise. Again, I'm probably the most knowledgeable person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| if you want someone from the team to address that. That might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4244)|
| 1:10:50| Well, to clarify, even though this condition is in place for the development agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| once the interlocal agreement is signed, the sports authority is able to move forward with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4257)|
| 1:11:05| issuing bonds, and they could spend that on consultants. In fact, there's a provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4265)|
| 1:11:12| here that says the developer can sign contracts without the sports authority's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4272)|
| 1:11:23| So it's reasonable to think that once the interlocal agreement is signed, bonds are issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4283)|
| 1:11:32| the developer could actually move forward with signing contracts, feeling very certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| that MLB is going to sign off on this deal, but obligating the city and the county through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| the interlocal agreement to whatever contract obligations are signed. Is that true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| No, that's not true. Once you've had opportunity to fully review the agreements, I think you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4313)|
| 1:12:00| see that because of the number of condition precedents in the agreement, that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| significant protections. The main protection for you all as your two bodies is this whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4326)|
| 1:12:12| financing plan will not work unless you eventually approve the TAF and PILOT for the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| development. That would be coming back to you in a couple of months. So at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| in time, you'll have detailed, you'll have a lot of the gaps, Councilman Parker, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| you're asking for answered by that point in time. But in the next two months, a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| of money will be spent by the team on further design work, a lot of money will be spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| by the city and county on folks like me and other consultants that if you all are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4354)|
| 1:12:39| interested in moving forward with this project, we would obviously like to know now so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| don't unwisely use community resources. And so that's why we're asking you all to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4363)|
| 1:12:48| ahead and vote on this. But until those holes are filled in and there will ultimately be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4368)|
| 1:12:55| another significant vote, at least one or two if not more, as Stephanie outlined in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| her plan, you will have plenty of opportunity to have this come back to you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Have what come back to us again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| You'll have this whole project come back to you again in connection with the TIF and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| the PILOTs in the first part of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| Oh, but the TIFs and the PILOTs are for the private development around the stadium, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| That's correct, but it's a part, as I've mentioned, it's a significant part of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| financing plan, so if it's not approved by you, we will not be moving forward with the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4402)|
| 1:13:29| Okay, but once we sign the interlocal agreement, the sports authority is authorized to issue bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4409)|
| 1:13:38| It's not, that's not practically possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4418)|
| 1:13:44| Legally, they are authorized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4424)|
| 1:13:47| Legally, are they authorized to issue bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| There's so many conditions, precedents in agreement to that happening, it's just not feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4431)|
| 1:13:58| Council Member Parker, we have six other lights on, I'm going to move on and you're more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| welcome to, I'll come back to you if you'd like to keep your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| Council Member Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| There has been a lot of work put into this, but I'd like to continue where Councilwoman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| Parker was talking about, then what does the interlocal agreement do if it's not allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| the bond issuance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| Well, ultimately, it will allow the sports authority to do a bond issue, knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| it has the sport, the sea, and the county, but that bond issue is not feasible until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| we get through the rest of the process, and so, again, we're trying to do our best, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| think Stephanie and Kristen, to get your all's input at each logical step on the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| to see, do you want us to keep this process going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4484)|
| 1:14:47| This is a very important agreement, and if you're not wanting to back the bonds with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| this non-property tax revenue pledge, then it's better for us to know it now than later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4493)|
| 1:14:59| because then we're just going to continue to spend money, and particularly, it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4499)|
| 1:15:03| unfair to the team, because we have made no commitment, they've spent millions on design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4507)|
| 1:15:08| And we've already spent a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| We've hardly spent anything, I mean, to speak of, but we're starting to incur more costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4509)|
| 1:15:15| certainly, we're starting to incur costs to help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| I mean, how many hours of the administration have already gone into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4519)|
| 1:15:22| That is hours of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| No, no, in terms of lost time, these guys have been remarkable how hard they've worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4523)|
| 1:15:27| Chris and Stephanie, but yeah, no, you're right, I mean, it's opportunity costs, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| So the piece that made me uncomfortable immediately was that there was an assumption that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| TIFs and the pilots will be approved, and we're already banking on that to be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| the repayment process, and that's putting the horse before the cart, or however that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| saying goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4548)|
| 1:15:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| So yeah, that feels really uncomfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4550)|
| 1:15:51| We don't have, we're not sure how we're going to pay it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| That hasn't been approved yet, but we're counting on it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| So I think Councilwoman Singer, you are, you know, getting to the heart of what we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4559)|
| 1:16:03| talking about, that this is a multi-layered deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| We've laid out, you know, really no significant change from the first workshop in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| for how to finance this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| So just as you indicated, there are significant resources, both, you know, time and other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| resources that have gone into the project to date, but in order to get it through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| finish line, there will need to be more resources put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| We need to know, do we want to commit to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| And there may be some of you who don't want to commit to that, which is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4593)|
| 1:16:37| to know now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| Typically, with projects like this, the commitment from the governing bodies happens much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4599)|
| 1:16:47| earlier than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4607)|
| 1:16:48| We have been working very hard to get as much detail to these bodies as possible so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| there's at least a level of comfort as we move forward to the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| We realize it's not going to make everybody comfortable, and we're looking at, as I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| Mayor Kincannon and Mayor Jacobs said, here's the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| The deal hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| If you look at the first slides from the first workshop, they're substantively the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| and we needed to do our due diligence to make sure that the numbers that we're providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| are the best possible numbers, negotiating with the team on details around this site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| and sort of how this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| And here we are, and we feel like this is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4651)|
| 1:17:35| We don't just feel like we know this is the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| This is like the fish or cut bait point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| Are we moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| Are we not moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4661)|
| 1:17:43| And that's what we're here to talk about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| Thank you for answering those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| I know it's hard to decide what goes first and what goes second and all the puzzle pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| We started, we are doing this project because we're trying to think of economic benefits to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4673)|
| 1:18:01| I would like to look at it as not from the top-down benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4681)|
| 1:18:06| Yes, there will be restauranteurs who make more money as people come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| but they're still going to be paying their waitstaff $2.16 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| So I'd like to look at it from the bottom up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| We're talking about 3,000 jobs, which is something that is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| But I want those to be good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| A job does not guarantee that a person is not going to live in poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| About 30% of this county has people who have jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| and they still go grocery shopping at the food pantries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| So I need it to be that it actually helps all of Knoxvilleans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4715)|
| 1:18:40| not just, you know, there are going to be millions of dollars made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4720)|

| 1:18:46| I'm just trying to take care of that bottom layer, which is all of our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| So there's a false narrative being put out right now that I just want to address and then move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4730)|
| 1:18:59| The narrative that these white unions are trying to make out like bandits and get all of the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4739)|
| 1:19:06| I don't think that's what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| and it means that we have to decide between DBEs or these white unions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| I think that these people that have been talking about community benefit agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4754)|
| 1:19:18| are talking for labor, for workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4758)|
| 1:19:22| Yes, they happen to be union people, but they're also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4762)|
| 1:19:25| these are the advocates that brought us the 40-hour workweek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Without these kind of advocates, we would have a very different system right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4769)|
| 1:19:35| That's an aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| I would like to talk about the community benefits agreement piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4776)|
| 1:19:41| and I've heard different things, so I'd like to ask Carla Campbell to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4781)|
| 1:19:48| She is the lawyer that negotiated the CBA in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4788)|
| 1:19:59| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4799)|
| 1:20:03| This individual is not on our published agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| No, but I think it's a very important piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| We've been told that it's not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| I'm sure it is, but we had presentations that were publicly noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4811)|
| 1:20:16| and the rest of the meeting is actually a discussion among the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| to ask questions of those presenters, commissioners, and counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| I don't think that we've gotten some accurate facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| and this is somebody who has some facts for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| and I don't think this is going to take very long, three to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4831)|
| 1:20:37| Are there specific questions that you'd like to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| rather than having someone come up and make a presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Sure, I can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4843)|
| 1:20:44| Would you like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4845)|
| 1:20:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4846)|
| 1:20:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4847)|
| 1:20:48| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4848)|
| 1:20:49| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4849)|
| 1:20:50| So I'm just trying to figure out the CBE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4850)|
| 1:20:53| I'm sorry, the CBA, and I don't really care what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| whether it's called legally a community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| or community benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4860)|
| 1:21:01| which there are a lot of community benefits being talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| and I'm very happy that we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| They're just more pieces, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| more people that can benefit from this than already will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| So would you explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4871)|
| 1:21:14| there are a lot of differences between what we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4874)|
| 1:21:17| than what was done in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| and it has been said that a community benefits agreement cannot be done here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| Can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Yeah, thank you for the opportunity to answer your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| I have been listening a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| I think I'm probably the only person in this room who has negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| or participated in the negotiation of community benefits agreement in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4895)|
| 1:21:40| The Nashville soccer stadium agreement was the first one in the state of its kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4900)|
| 1:21:44| that I don't consider myself an expert in anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| but we did because it was the first of its kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| It did require us to really dig into and understand the laws around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| And so I'm happy to speak to what I learned in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| which is really just that a community benefits agreement is a very simple concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4920)|
| 1:22:07| It's an agreement between private parties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| that makes a private entity that is receiving some sort of public good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| put in writing their commitments, put in writing their commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4935)|
| 1:22:19| And so there's nothing that we –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| there's nothing about a community benefits agreement in general terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| that cannot be done here just like it was in Nashville with the soccer stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| The agreement itself would not be between the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| between the city or the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Those are all public entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| The agreement would be between the developer or one of its affiliated entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4963)|
| 1:22:49| in a community group, a public group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| In Nashville we had a coalition of different groups that came together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| and formed the 501c3 to negotiate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| And that really is a space for those private entities to take the mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| that this body has given them to put into writing a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| that the public benefits will be around this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| and a mandate to privately negotiate the details of what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| and put it into writing so that those parties can come to you later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5000)|
| 1:23:24| and they have deliverables that are in a written agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| an enforceable agreement that they can present to you their delivery of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| and the outcome of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| It is true that the property ownership is switched from what it was in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5015)|
| 1:23:43| to what it is here in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| That doesn't prevent a community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| or a private agreement between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| Again, the agreement would not be with the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5032)|
| 1:23:55| The agreement would be between the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5035)|
| 1:23:58| and the community groups that this council thought should be at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| There's nothing about the differences in the ownership of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| In Nashville, the construction of the stadium itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| was actually carved out of the community benefits agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| because the stadium was public, it was owned by the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| and it went through a public procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| That obviously is governed by state law, public procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| You guys deal with that a lot, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| And so that had to go through that channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| It could not be part of a private agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5072)|
| 1:24:35| It was the other pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| It was the operation of the stadium, the concessionaires, the parking attendants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5076)|
| 1:24:43| All those folks were going to work at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5083)|
| 1:24:45| and it was the development around the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| which was a land gift from the city to the private entity in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| In this case, it would just be flipped, and, in fact, in a lot of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| you stand in a better position legally to have a community benefits agreement here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| Excuse me, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| Can the speaker identify herself and tell us who she's with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| We have no understanding of who we're being presented to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| It's not on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Ma'am, would you state your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Thank you for that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| My name is Carla Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5114)|
| 1:25:15| I'm a partner at the law firm of Bransford or Strange and Jennings in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| I'm also a graduate of Carnes High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| so I'm glad to be back in front of you guys here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| Like I said, I represented community groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| in the negotiation of the MLS community benefits agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5127)|
| 1:25:30| Thank you so much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| So, you know, as I said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I think that there are a lot of benefits that this can bring to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| I'm just trying to think from the bottom up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| because the trickle-down economics does not work for those at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| So I'm thinking about those 3,000 jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| Yes, it's very good that 15% will cover the majority of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5149)|
| 1:25:56| non-white women, veteran-owned businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5156)|
| 1:26:03| 15% is the minimum that that should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| What is the 85%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| Who are those people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| Those are the people that always get taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Who are those employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| Will they be taken care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| These are my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| These are the people that I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| I want there to be good jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| and I want them to be able to afford their life here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5180)|
| 1:26:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5185)|
| 1:26:29| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| What I'm going to say right here is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Mayor Kincaid mentioned a golf course that's costing us $200,000 a year to run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| Well, we've got a golf course, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| but makes money and raises over $600,000 a year to give to charity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| and it's publicly owned but sort of run like private industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5215)|
| 1:27:03| Private industry raises more money, and it can get to different people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5223)|
| 1:27:07| and it goes to a lot of charities, that $600,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5227)|
| 1:27:11| but it has to be run properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| The thing that I think that kind of gets me a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| we've got a lot of money we're going to invest in this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| but I went to a free UT orange and white game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| I took my kids with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| When I got through, it was over $250 came out of my pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| for those two grandkids that I took,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| and it was money spent on product there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| A lot of people can't spend that kind of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5259)|
| 1:27:41| but they do want to go to the ballgames,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5261)|
| 1:27:43| and they do want to spend their money on entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| My question is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| if you're spending $10 for a drink, or it's a beer, or it's a Coke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5271)|
| 1:27:56| or $10 for a hot dog, or $10 for popcorn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| or cotton candy and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| and you want to take your kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5281)|
| 1:28:03| in a little while, you've spent $200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| if you take two or three of your grandkids with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| and then when you walk out of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| my problem is the businesses along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5291)|
| 1:28:16| are we going to leave them enough money to give to those businesses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| And a lot of people want to go to the game,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| but cannot spend the money on the tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| Can we do something to help those people to enjoy the ballpark also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| Maybe we can do some things for them, you know, for giveaways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| but we need this kind of development here to bring people in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| People will spend more money on sports than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5320)|
| 1:28:45| They will even go sit in a bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| and spend money to watch it on television| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| when they can watch it on television at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| And that brings money back into the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| And to answer some of these questions down here about the bottom up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5337)|
| 1:29:02| you've got to have that money flowing in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| to where those people have opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| to get that money up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5348)|
| 1:29:11| And from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| Mr. Boyd's going to do some things to help develop minority businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5354)|
| 1:29:20| If we don't do anything, we're going to get what we've always had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5360)|
| 1:29:25| But this is an opportunity to bring money in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| from 10 or 12 counties around us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5368)|
| 1:29:32| and really support this community through that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| So if we sit here and we do nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| and we tell all kinds of reasons why we can't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| the people from the bottom up are still not going to get an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5382)|
| 1:29:46| to get a chance to advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| So we've got to give them the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5389)|
| 1:29:53| And if you look back, I grew up during the 60s when it was really bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5393)|
| 1:29:57| and people gained from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| They advanced from that point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| and they lifted themselves up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| And I don't know what we're going to do, like you say, from the bottom up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| but we've got to get that money flowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| so we can do at least a little something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| for the people that really want to advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5414)|
| 1:30:18| And this is an opportunity to make the community to advance on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| So, like I say, we can sit here, we can talk about all these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| but until the money starts flowing, nothing's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| And I'm going to stop now because I'll get like Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| and put the people behind me asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| So anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Which one fell asleep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| They all were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| They all were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| But I wasn't going to bring that up, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| I really wasn't going to embarrass you in front of everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| But I hope you understand that you've got to have this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5450)|
| 1:30:55| to advance your community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| So that's what I want to say about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| I want to support it heartily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Thank you, Chairman Buehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| Mark, you and Chris know I'm the numbers guy and concentrate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| So I'm going to just reference my remarks as far as the financial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| Are we in receipt of the state funds of the $13.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| Chris has the checks in the mail, and I'm not kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| They've got our information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Apparently because I'm listed as a registered agent, it's supposed to arrive in my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| and I'm carefully monitoring every envelope to make sure I don't think I won the lottery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| But it should be here soon, so we're waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| But we filled out all the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5500)|
| 1:31:41| We've got the bank account open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| We're just waiting for the money to arrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| And the grant agreement has been signed between the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5505)|
| 1:31:48| which is the biggest precedent to that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5508)|
| 1:31:51| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| On your summary of agreements, page 3, you talk about the $80.1 million for the stadium budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5513)|
| 1:32:00| We already heard that you said that the 5.8 is what the Boyd Sports is going to put in for the extra amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5520)|
| 1:32:07| Can you break down the $74.3 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5527)|
| 1:32:11| $74.3 million is really the hard cost of the construction of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5531)|
| 1:32:15| and the related design costs for designing and overseeing the construction of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5535)|
| 1:32:23| I'm not sure I'm answering your question well, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| but that's really the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| There's nothing in there other than stadium construction costs and related items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| The capitalized interest that I mentioned in the other slide is not in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| Okay, so we take the $65 million bond minus that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5557)|
| 1:32:41| and then the balance is then divided between the city and county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| You said $74.3 publicly funded, so I'm thinking $65 million is publicly funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5569)|
| 1:32:55| so you'd subtract that from $74.3, and then the balance is paid for by both bodies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| Yeah, except for the $4.2 million, if you look on the next page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| of the capitalized interest and the issuance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| That brings it back up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| Okay, and then on your interlocal project agreement, the Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5588)|
| 1:33:18| that portion comes to $10.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| Is that figured anywhere as in these numbers that you've presented here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5603)|
| 1:33:29| In other words, that's what the city and county have to pay over 30 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| for the Capital Improvements Reserve Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| Yeah, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| You're saying $10 million total between the two entities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| So it's $5.1 per entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5623)|
| 1:33:44| Because somebody else had asked me, and I thought, and I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5624)|
| 1:33:47| Mr. Coonser Smith had asked me before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| and I thought it was more like around $4.6 for each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| But, yes, that's not, because that's an annual payment that would come in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| It's not in the initial construction cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Okay, and that would come out of our general funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5637)|
| 1:33:59| I think for us that could still come out of a hotel fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| because we're paying for a tourism facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5644)|
| 1:34:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| And then on the infrastructure costs for everything now that they're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| underground, who's covering those costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5655)|
| 1:34:17| Is that related to any of these documents in front of us here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| I'll take that one, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| So there are a couple of different types of infrastructure we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5664)|
| 1:34:29| So the orange that's on your map that's up there, which is the public plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| the streets, those are city pieces of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| We typically front capital dollars to pay for those pieces of infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| That's when Mr. Caldwell spoke earlier, Mr. Mamentoff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| about the Magnolia Avenue redevelopment area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| and a TIF district that can help fund that public infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| So there's that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| And then there's also utilities, which is KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| And, you know, that's a piece we're working closely with KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5702)|
| 1:35:06| just as we do with all other redevelopment projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| As you can imagine, this is a pretty old site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| So there are several projects that will probably be part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| what would have been on their capital plan in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5718)|
| 1:35:21| to fix old infrastructure that is part of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5721)|
| 1:35:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5726)|
| 1:35:27| And then you referenced the multimodal transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| Who's going to cover the costs of that to transport the patrons to the ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5732)|
| 1:35:40| So the multimodal transportation plan is really looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5740)|
| 1:35:44| we've got existing CAT routes that are already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| so Knox Area Transit already goes to this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| They have been at the table with PBA, the engineers, project engineers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| city engineering staff, and even our greenway staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| our parks and greenway staff, to talk about how do we make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5758)|
| 1:36:02| that the plan capitalizes on Knox Area Transit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| our existing parking facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| but then we also have this blossoming market of rideshare, scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| you know, bikes, things like that that are not a public cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| Those are amenities that are in our community that we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| and we are, not we just don't need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| We are incorporating those into the plan for the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| and how people are going to get back and forth from the existing parking in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Just the last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5793)|
| 1:36:35| May I ask a question to Mr. Boyd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| Do you mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| In your opening remarks to us, you made a comment about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| DENARC construction and minority contractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| but you said if selected, meaning DENARC construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5809)|
| 1:36:53| so what did you mean by that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| I think the sports authority has final say on all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| But it's in the lease, it's in the development agreement right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| that DENARC would be the construction manager for the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| but if the sports authority chose not to approve that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| then we'd have to go back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| They were selected, much like in other jurisdictions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| as the attorney from Nashville mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| that they went through an RFP process to select them as a construction manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5838)|
| 1:37:22| and they would then bid out the subcontracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| as part of the procurement process here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| Sports authorities are somewhat unique that they're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| particularly a joint one like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| is not under the same procurement rules as the city or county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| which have very different procurement rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| Yeah. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5858)|
| 1:37:39| And then just on a side note, on Friday I had a chance to meet your uncle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| who's actually an elected official in Obine County, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5864)|
| 1:37:47| Oh, yes. I've already met him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5867)|
| 1:37:49| He's everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5869)|
| 1:37:51| I didn't even realize who he was until after I finished the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| but he wanted to know how the progress of the stadium was going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5874)|
| 1:37:57| so I updated him and told him we were going to meet tonight and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5877)|
| 1:38:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5880)|
| 1:38:01| I was very impressed that a member of your family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| is also an elected official in a county in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| He's the one that got elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5887)|
| 1:38:10| He's got a great reputation, very personal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5893)|
| 1:38:14| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| I'm going to stay on page three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| and talk about infrastructure improvements as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5904)|
| 1:38:28| So in that first part of the summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| it says the developer will donate land and provide a clean site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| Obviously we know that this was previously a chicken processing plant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| as was discussed earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| Does clean site in this particular instance mean that the site is cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| and ready for construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| or does it mean that the soil is ready for digging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| and you can go ahead and do construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Council Member Roberto, that's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| And yes, what it means is that the land will be donated ready for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| That's part of the deal that we've negotiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| and that's part of the land donation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| So it means that it's been environmentally tested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| and that if there were any costs for some type of remediation or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5949)|
| 1:39:15| then it would be on the developer to take care of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5955)|
| 1:39:18| All of that, yes, is part of the Brownfield Agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| and that is part of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| There's a whole team of engineers that have been involved with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| to make sure that what ends up happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| is appropriate for the environmental conditions of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5972)|
| 1:39:33| And then the next part we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| the city is responsible for streets and public plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| In the map, obviously that's the orange piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5977)|
| 1:39:42| There's nothing in here that tells me where the public plaza is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5982)|
| 1:39:46| but I have a feeling it's to the left of Building A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Yes, and you may remember from our August workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| we went through the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| I have slides if I need to show them again, but you are correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| Councilman Roberto, that is on the west side of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| which would be towards the Old City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6003)|
| 1:40:06| There's a public plaza design that is about the same size as Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6006)|
| 1:40:11| So we're talking about a really large, significant public plaza| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| that will be part of the overall project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| And so with that responsibility there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| are we also talking about sidewalks, road improvements, things like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| All of that is part of the streetscape design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| and the engineering and design discussion that's been underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6030)|
| 1:40:35| And do we have a cost estimate for what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| Yeah, we're talking about for the streetscapes and public plaza,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| we're talking about a $10 million to $14 million infrastructure cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| And just to give you a comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| that's probably about half as much or less than half as much as Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6050)|
| 1:40:56| I mean, we put about $14 million into Austin Homes for streets and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| So it's on par with other types of redevelopment projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| that we do very frequently in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| And then the next part is KUB, Responsible for Utility Infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| You talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6074)|
| 1:41:15| I would imagine here we're talking about electric, water, sewer, and gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| All of those things, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Do you have an estimate on how much that's going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6080)|
| 1:41:22| We're still working through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| That's a good question, Councilman Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| So we work closely with KUB all the time on redevelopment projects like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| So we're coordinating with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6091)|
| 1:41:33| and those numbers are still being, you know, based on the design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| they're going to range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| So we're still working with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6099)|
| 1:41:41| And I can appreciate you're still working with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Do you have an idea of how that's going to get broken down, the KUB piece?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6104)|
| 1:41:48| Is that, you know, something that the developer is going to be helping with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| the city and county are working together on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| Do you have any sense of where that's going to end up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| So, you know, initial conversations, there's, you know, KUB has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| and I'm trying to remember the name of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| but an aging infrastructure program that has some capital funds in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6124)|
| 1:42:08| You know, I think that this is part of what we're still negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| I guess that's the short answer to the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| Part of what we're still negotiating is the KUB infrastructure piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| what's already part of their capital plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| what kind of infrastructure dollars do we need to bring to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| how can we get some of the cost savings by doing it at the exact same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6144)|
| 1:42:27| as we're doing streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6147)|
| 1:42:29| That's where we find the most savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| So good questions, and those are questions that we will continue to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| as we get further down the design lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| we'll be able to answer those much more precisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| Well, and then, you know, looking at the map again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| we've got the yellow pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| which are the private owned development pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| along with the multi-use stadium, which is publicly owned, operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| You know, the sports authority is involved in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6172)|
| 1:42:55| and then the publicly owned spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| Is the public going to be dealing with upgrades for utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6177)|
| 1:43:01| in the privately owned sections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| or only going to be looking at upgrades in the publicly owned section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6183)|
| 1:43:10| So the utilities that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| that are inside the private development become, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| that's part of the private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| But obviously when you're upgrading utilities in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| it serves every user in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| and it will serve to support private development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| not just for those buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| but for further private development in the area where the stadium is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| The Student Improvement Reserve Fund is about $10.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| as we talked about earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| How was the schedule generated, produced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| What advice or experience did you use to project the future capital needs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| I think a little bit of that is we relied on the expertise of Doug Kirchhofer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| from Boyd Sports and his relationships in this industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| And as Mark had said, he had some of his staff to do some research as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| And so we came up with a stair-step method of increasing that reserve over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6266)|
| 1:44:35| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| And a lot of that is based off history of other stadiums as well and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| they've seen and when costs have started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| They just wanted to start doing some capital improvement needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| So you feel fairly comfortable in these figures and that they will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| What I don't want to do is set up future commissions and councils with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| hey, we need $10, $15 million to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| I think we are comfortable with what we have presented and talking with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| They have comfort in those numbers too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| Are the capital improvement projects that will come out of this fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| is it the sole discretion of the sports authority what these projects are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| So the lease agreement provides a mechanism for the team and the sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| authority to meet annually to set up, just as you all probably do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| is a capital improvements plan for each five-year period and to agree upon it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6330)|
| 1:45:35| jointly and to bring in experts as needed to determine what items may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6335)|
| 1:45:43| needed to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| So it's a joint process between the team and the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| subject to mutual approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6352)|
| 1:45:53| Are there any regulations on how this money is held and how it can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| invested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| So I would envision that this would be held by the bond trustee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6360)|
| 1:46:06| and that's why we were calling it a capital reserve fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| which is sort of a typical term in bond lingo where you actually put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| with a trustee who would invest it in very conservative investments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| and it would be segregated from all other funds so that it would never be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6377)|
| 1:46:22| able to be used for any other purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| And back to a little bit of the subject matter earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| with a significant portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6393)|
| 1:46:35| a fair amount of payment for bond debt service coming from the TIFS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| and Pilots on the private sector development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6401)|
| 1:46:46| do we know will these happen simultaneously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| and is there any kind of bond performance that will be in place in case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6410)|
| 1:46:55| these things never come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6415)|
| 1:46:58| So that's the private development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| We'll deal with those issues and would be presented no later than when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| TIF pilot resolutions would be presented to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6427)|
| 1:47:11| And, yes, that agreement would have some sort of liquidated damages provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6431)|
| 1:47:15| in it to essentially be tied to the loss that would occur in the event that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| the private development wasn't done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Looking at this map, I made this a whole lot better with one strike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| that Florida Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| You should just put street to be named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6453)|
| 1:47:40| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6464)|
| 1:47:45| I have one or two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| Are the three of you aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6469)|
| 1:47:51| you guys got to go see a bunch of different stadiums from what I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6471)|
| 1:47:54| and that you've talked to a bunch of different people in this field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6474)|
| 1:47:57| Are you aware of any other stadium agreement in America where we have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| anchor tenant that pays seven figures in rent, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Are any three of you aware?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| Commissioner Ward, none is a fixed rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| What we saw was there were abilities based on variable rent if they panned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6494)|
| 1:48:19| out to make more than a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| It would be misleading to you to tell you otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| The Huntsville lease, actually Madison, Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6503)|
| 1:48:26| theoretically you could make more than a million dollars if you were to sit in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6506)|
| 1:48:29| certain ticket goals or if the naming rights sold for a certain amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| But not fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| We did not see any other lease of this nature for a minor league baseball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6514)|
| 1:48:40| of any size of that magnitude of an annual payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| Again, we hired an expert to look at that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| We searched ourselves as best we could, the three of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| But, no, we're not aware as that large of a fixed payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6532)|
| 1:49:02| But, again, with some input obviously from you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6542)|
| 1:49:06| went for a larger fixed payment instead of a variable income source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6546)|
| 1:49:10| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6550)|
| 1:49:11| I'd rather have a fixed income so we can base that off for future purposes as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| Second question, are we aware of any stadium that has been given private land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| cleared and ready to build a public stadium on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6561)|
| 1:49:25| You said before the stadiums that are in Nashville, it's actually the reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6565)|
| 1:49:29| Are we aware of any other stadium that has this kind of advantage as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| That one I'm sure has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| There's the stadium in Springfield, I think it's Missouri,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| the guy sort of built a stadium in his own legacy that he basically donated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| the whole stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6583)|
| 1:49:44| I would say that's an aberration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6584)|
| 1:49:45| I'm sure Mr. Boyd and I can tell you it's sort of a joke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6585)|
| 1:49:50| in the thing that he sort of wanted to build a monument to himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| And he didn't have anything to do with the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| He just wanted something to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6594)|
| 1:49:58| Kind of like Jimmy's World in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6598)|
| 1:50:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| So could you say that that's never happened before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6602)|
| 1:50:05| I think that would be unfair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6605)|
| 1:50:06| I think from everything we read that particularly if you're looking at an urban site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6606)|
| 1:50:12| downtown or near that, it's very difficult to aggregate land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| unless there's a public site sort of available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| And that's – so I think it is certainly not never happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6618)|
| 1:50:24| but it's pretty rare that a developer comes or a team owner comes to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| and says, look, I've acquired this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6628)|
| 1:50:30| I'm willing to donate it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6630)|
| 1:50:31| And I sort of think that's more of the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6631)|
| 1:50:36| we're certainly in aberration in that respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| So you haven't utilized this land privately or publicly in 10, 20 years, you said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6639)|
| 1:50:47| It's been a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6647)|
| 1:50:48| It's been vacant for a long, long time, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| And we're adding 3,000 jobs roughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| I mean, that's really what the economic development people are estimating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6662)|
| 1:51:03| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Well, this has been a fun night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| I can tell everyone is so excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6670)|
| 1:51:11| Can the Urban League talk about all the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6671)|
| 1:51:15| and the meetings that you all had and how many people have been attending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6675)|
| 1:51:21| and what – I guess what traits have been represented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6681)|
| 1:51:31| Thank you for the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| Thank you for the question, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| And thank you for the opportunity for us to share what we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6696)|
| 1:51:41| As I presented to the Sports Authority a week or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6701)|
| 1:51:46| the Urban League has had 17 various trainings over the last few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6706)|
| 1:51:56| to address the work that we have been engaged in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6716)|
| 1:52:02| Our engagement is in three different areas, construction, entrepreneurship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| and workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| And so on the first part of it, as we look at opportunities to address the 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6730)|
| 1:52:20| which I will tell you that we talk about it as the 15% floor, not the ceiling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6740)|
| 1:52:27| and our aspirations are to greatly exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| And working with the entire team of folks involved in this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6751)|
| 1:52:37| I know that their aspiration is for us to exceed that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| Trainings that we have had are, number one, let me say that we began by surveying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6762)|
| 1:52:51| and exploring the number of minority contracts, DBEs, that are in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6771)|
| 1:52:59| especially focused in this area, who could qualify, be licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| or certified to participate, and to determine where they are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6785)|
| 1:53:14| And so the Urban League has worked with other partners to make sure that people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| are licensed or bonded or whatever they need to shore them up so that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| qualified when the opportunity, when bids are out, that they are qualified to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| One of the things that I think that we are doing that is unusual is that we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6812)|
| 1:53:39| matching and pairing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| We have a lot of small businesses, especially DBEs and minority businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6822)|
| 1:53:48| in East Knoxville, that are three or fewer employees, including the business owner themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6828)|
| 1:53:57| And so their capacity is limited to participate in a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6837)|
| 1:54:02| So what we're doing is we are matching and pairing to increase the opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| for minority businesses to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6848)|

| 1:54:16| We had it toward the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| We had 115 people at the Urban League to come and to put in that I either want to be a vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6860)|
| 1:54:29| this is where I might fit in the construction, and this is where I need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6869)|

| 1:54:40| Two weeks ago, we had another opportunity, and we had 62 people to register and 77 to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6880)|
| 1:54:49| And everybody registers through our website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Our website is also bilingual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6892)|

| 1:55:03| One of the things that we are working with, as has been alluded to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6903)|
| 1:55:07| is the types of training that the Urban League is providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6907)|

| 1:55:14| and so people have the opportunity to get industry-certified training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6914)|
| 1:55:20| In working with the state of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| we know that to put people into a fully-fledged apprenticeship program takes time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6923)|
| 1:55:30| But our commitment to the residents of East Knoxville is that when the project starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6930)|
| 1:55:36| we want people to be ready to take advantage of that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| But in addition to that, we want to put people on a career path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6940)|
| 1:55:44| Councilman Singh said we want people to be lifted up out of poverty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| In order to do that, that is not a wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| That is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| That is a plan to put people on a pathway on development of skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6955)|
| 1:56:00| And we are working with our state apprenticeship program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6960)|
| 1:56:06| We're working with WIOA because training must be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| And we're also working with our local institutions here, Pellissippi and TCAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6971)|
| 1:56:17| The Urban League has always been focused on the economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6977)|
| 1:56:23| and also the economic self-sufficiency of the residents of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6983)|
| 1:56:29| And we know that one project, no matter how great it is, is not going to be the end-all, be-all for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6989)|
| 1:56:37| And our commitment is to make sure that as many residents as possible have that opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=6997)|
| 1:56:47| whether it's through a construction job, an entrepreneurship job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7007)|
| 1:56:53| vendors that are going to be around, whether they're an orange or a blue or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7013)|
| 1:57:01| we want to make sure people have opportunities for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| And so many of the opportunities for the minority community in Knoxville have been lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| because when the opportunity came, they didn't have access to information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| and they didn't know about it in time to be prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| And the Urban League has been working on making sure that people not only have access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7040)|
| 1:57:26| but we are working with all of the partners in this process to make sure that when they get the information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7046)|
| 1:57:33| we get the information and the community gets the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7053)|
| 1:57:38| So I hope I've shared enough of you, but I've got a lot more to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7064)|
| 1:57:45| I was able to attend, I guess that was the first one with 115,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7065)|
| 1:57:49| and I did leave inspired because it was so many people from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7069)|
| 1:57:54| And, you know, sometimes that takes a lot when you live in a community where people still feel hopeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7074)|
| 1:57:59| but they got out there and they put their name in the hat and it was networking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7083)|
| 1:58:04| And we're trying every venue that we know of to make sure that people are informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7084)|

| 1:58:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| My name is Phyllis Nichols, 1514 East 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7094)|

| 1:58:21| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7101)|
| 1:58:23| Council Member Smith, I believe you have not spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7103)|
| 1:58:28| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7108)|
| 1:58:29| I have a few questions, but I'll try to get through them quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7109)|
| 1:58:32| We've talked a lot about community benefits, whether formal, informal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| how they're written I think is worth a debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| but I want to commend particularly the DV reporting that's required of the sports authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| So I think that's really important, that accountability is critical if, nonetheless, that gets accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7125)|
| 1:58:52| The second, kind of second, third, and fourth questions are from Ms. Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| and some of the folks at this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| Just to make sure I have some numbers right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| the contract states that the capital improvements are not to be used until later on in years 30 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7142)|
| 1:59:11| and that the developer is required for maintenance and any improvements to the ballpark in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7151)|
| 1:59:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| So the Capital Improvement Reserve Fund can be used for capital improvements really at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| so it doesn't mean that it's only for capital improvements after the 30th year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| Sorry if that wasn't clear, but what we have found through our research is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7171)|
| 1:59:37| capital improvement expenditures are typically not very significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7177)|
| 1:59:43| until the stadium has been in operation for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| So the smart thing to do is to budget for that and to start contributing towards that fund early on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| so that as chillers go out and as roofs need to be fixed, as the structure ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7193)|
| 2:00:02| that we have those dollars in reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| I think the second part of the question was about routine maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| and yes, the tenant will be responsible for routine maintenance and operations, utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7209)|
| 2:00:15| things like that related to the function and operations of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7219)|
| 2:00:20| My next question, just to make sure I have some numbers right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7220)|
| 2:00:22| there's $10.2 million, that's the budget for the Capital Improvement Reserve Fund, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7222)|
| 2:00:28| That's probably right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Close, for sure, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| And it's to be funded through two mechanisms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| One is a portion from the contingency costs associated with the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| which are about $7.2 million, I think I heard earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7241)|
| 2:00:43| A portion of the contingency would go towards, leftover contingency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7243)|
| 2:00:49| a portion of it would see the Capital Reserve Fund, yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| Well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| And describe the list of items that contingency is supposed to cover if it's a shovel-ready site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7255)|
| 2:01:01| The contingency would cover things like unexpected conditions on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7261)|
| 2:01:08| unexpected cost increases over the budgeted, so with the cost of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7268)|
| 2:01:14| I mean, I am not a construction expert, you're probably asking the wrong person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| but, you know, if the cost of concrete goes up and there's a contingency for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7277)|
| 2:01:24| Can we have a construction expert answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| There are plenty of them in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7286)|
| 2:01:28| I thought I saw a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7288)|
| 2:01:29| Who wants to take a stab at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| I just want to follow up as somebody comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| Council Member Roberto, his line of questioning was related to environmental checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7295)|
| 2:01:43| and the site being ready for construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7303)|
| 2:01:45| So if that's supposed to be taken care of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| talk about what's included in the contingency costs in the construction budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7307)|
| 2:01:53| Fair seat with Gemma, associate to the architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7313)|
| 2:01:57| Normal contingencies in a construction job at this stage of the game when the project is still being designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7317)|
| 2:02:05| steel is still being designed, concrete is still being designed, mechanical systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| so there's always some leeway and you don't get to the end of it or to an exact number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7329)|
| 2:02:15| until you're done with construction documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7335)|
| 2:02:17| So, therefore, any time we're at this stage of budgeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| we'll always allow a contingency to make sure we take care of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7340)|
| 2:02:24| So even though we're closer to final documents, we've still got a ways to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| and that's what a contingency is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7348)|
| 2:02:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7349)|

| 2:02:39| particularly in the county, but I think we heard earlier how the county is going to pay for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7359)|
| 2:02:44| Can you talk about how the city is going to pay for our portion of those funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7364)|
| 2:02:49| They would be budgeted, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| I mean, we don't typically commit specific revenue sources for specific purposes in our budgeting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7371)|
| 2:02:59| It's not a practice that the city follows unless we are required to commit specific revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7379)|
| 2:03:06| for specific purposes that provides us the ability to be flexible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7386)|
| 2:03:11| when we're trying to meet the needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7391)|
| 2:03:13| There are multiple sources of operating revenue that could be applied towards capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7393)|
| 2:03:20| particularly at the levels that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7403)|
| 2:03:24| So until year 10 or that break-even point, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| the city, particularly, the capital dollars are associated with the bond payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| and the capital reserve fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7413)|
| 2:03:35| So I think we're talking about, yes, you named it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| We're talking about two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7420)|
| 2:03:41| We're talking about debt service payments that will be paid for equally by the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| and we're also talking about a capital reserve fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| So in terms of city budgeting, those are the two items we need to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7428)|
| 2:03:53| For the stadium construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7433)|
| 2:03:54| For the foreseeable future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7434)|
| 2:03:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7435)|
| 2:03:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7437)|
| 2:03:58| One more step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7438)|
| 2:04:00| The last question I had is for Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| Would you come to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7445)|
| 2:04:06| I'll just raise my question as you make your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7446)|
| 2:04:10| We've talked a lot about the economics in terms of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7450)|
| 2:04:13| and what's in it for folks who want to get employment internships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7453)|
| 2:04:17| I saw some description there about how internship leads to employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7457)|
| 2:04:21| Knoxville Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7461)|
| 2:04:23| I want to make sure also that the sport or the event is accessible to mom and three kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7463)|
| 2:04:31| And so one might argue that the football games are out of reach for somebody like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7471)|
| 2:04:38| So while we talk about employment for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7478)|
| 2:04:40| I know you probably have pre-night or school night or discounting that happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| with the Smokies games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7485)|
| 2:04:47| How do you make sure that the entertainment that you're proposing is still accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| for the person who lives a quarter mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7491)|
| 2:04:54| become not just for work but for entertainment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7494)|
| 2:04:57| I want to first thank Commissioner Busworth for spending $250 at a Smokies game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7497)|
| 2:05:01| If everybody spent that much, we'd be in a very different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7501)|
| 2:05:05| But most studies will show that minor league baseball is one of the most economical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| family entertainments that you can have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| Just to be competitive with the rest of the league, we'll continue to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7513)|
| 2:05:17| But with regards to some of the other events, concerts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| that will be up to the concert providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| I don't know the details on what concerts will cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| but I'm sure we're going to do everything we can to make it as affordable as we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| to make sure that we have events that are accessible to everybody in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7531)|

| 2:05:38| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| We didn't have very many free dollars to go to KJ's games when we were little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| but it was special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7543)|
| 2:05:45| I want to make sure that the people who live within a quarter mile around there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| have a chance to do something special with their kids beyond the employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7550)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7555)|

| 2:05:59| I'd like to take a break here for the benefit of our council members and commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| as well as the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| Just a reminder to both bodies that each of us does have a meeting next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7566)|
| 2:06:10| at which time both of these items will be on our agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7570)|
| 2:06:13| We'll have an opportunity to then discuss these as well and ask questions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7573)|
| 2:06:17| We have several members that have not spoken yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| and we have a couple of members that I want to call on for a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7579)|
| 2:06:23| But when we come back, I do want to move through our questions as quickly as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| so that the public has been very patient and can get to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7586)|
| 2:06:30| And then Vice Mayor McKenzie has some comments before we close the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| I'll stand in recess until 8.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| Commissioners and council members, if you'll please take your seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7595)|
| 2:06:40| I'll call this joint workshop back to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7600)|
| 2:06:48| I'd like to keep with our published agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| and finish our questions from the commissioners and council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7612)|
| 2:06:56| and then conclude with public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7616)|
| 2:07:00| I will call first on Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7625)|
| 2:07:08| I don't have a question. I've got more of a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| Chris, Stephanie, and Mark probably didn't sleep a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| because they knew I was going to call them and meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7635)|

| 2:07:27| We got a lot of questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| This is just a statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7650)|
| 2:07:31| I, too, was concerned in the beginning, as Mayor Jacobs was, about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7651)|
| 2:07:38| Is this really going to work or is this going to end up as a taxpayer issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7658)|
| 2:07:45| Taxpayers are going to have to spend a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7665)|

| 2:08:04| It's not only a stopping point for a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7684)|

| 2:09:56| to thoroughly look at it and read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7796)|
| 2:09:59| I do want to ask either Ms. Welch or Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| rather than call on someone from the Sports Authority Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| unless they just want to answer this question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| has the Sports Authority Board received these documents and have already reviewed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7809)|
| 2:10:16| They have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7816)|
| 2:10:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7817)|
| 2:10:18| So they are with the Sports Authority's attorney now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7818)|
| 2:10:22| and they went out to the Sports Authority's attorney this afternoon, this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7822)|
| 2:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| And will the Sports Authority have the opportunity to have looked at these documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7830)|
| 2:10:35| and make comments or whatever their attorney deems necessary on their behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7835)|
| 2:10:40| prior to next Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7840)|
| 2:10:44| We will make ourselves available to the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| Again, the development agreement and the lease agreement will not be voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| At their meeting next week, the interlocal agreement will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7853)|
| 2:10:56| So the development agreement and lease agreement, my apologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| will certainly be part of the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7862)|
| 2:11:04| and just as with you we're available to speak with Sports Authority Board members at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7864)|
| 2:11:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7871)|
| 2:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7872)|
| 2:11:13| Just in looking at the information, and so, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7873)|
| 2:11:17| this is a huge opportunity for economic investment, not just in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7877)|
| 2:11:22| but especially in the East Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| and with such I feel like we are going to have to be intentional just as we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| with preserving the history of the community where this stadium is going to be located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| and that of East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7895)|
| 2:11:37| And so I want to just ask a little bit about when we talk about minority persons on page 30, 31,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7897)|
| 2:11:44| that encompasses a lot of different cultures and backgrounds and ethnicities that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7904)|
| 2:11:53| I just want to say that it's going to take intentionality all the way around as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| to ensure that we are really being intentional about people from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7918)|
| 2:12:04| those that are African American, being able to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| the opportunity and access to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| I know that that's part of the contract that Mr. Boyd has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7929)|
| 2:12:12| and the commitment with the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7932)|
| 2:12:14| And so when I move over to page 32,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| and there's 16.3 measures to enhance DBE participation that during the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7938)|
| 2:12:24| developer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to achieve the DBE contract goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| But then I'm also very pleased to go down and look at 16.3C| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7950)|
| 2:12:36| to see that there's going to be a diversity coordinator that will be hired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7956)|
| 2:12:40| And so I want to ask, and I'm not sure who this question goes to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| It may be Mr. Boyd. I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7963)|
| 2:12:46| What is the timeline if this person has not already been hired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| What is the timeline for this person to be in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7969)|
| 2:13:02| Doug saves the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| I'm Doug Kirchhofer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7986)|
| 2:13:08| It's a pleasure to have an opportunity to be with you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7988)|
| 2:13:10| I think there's not a specific answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| I think we would expect to have that person in place based on the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| probably sometime early in 23 as it relates to Boyd Sports and the stadium operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=7997)|
| 2:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8006)|
| 2:13:27| So this is more so for the management because when I read through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8007)|
| 2:13:34| it states that the diversity coordinator should be responsible for overall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| management of the developer's efforts to achieve the DBE contract goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8017)|
| 2:13:42| track solicit or appropriate bids from DBEs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8022)|
| 2:13:45| tracking of the outcomes achieved as a result of the diversity efforts set forth in the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8025)|
| 2:13:49| And I absolutely encourage our colleagues around the table to take a look at that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| So can you speak a little bit more about that, Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8034)|
| 2:13:56| Is it just for once it's developed or is it throughout the development process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| Are you referencing the lease or the development agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8041)|
| 2:14:05| It is the stadium development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8045)|
| 2:14:09| I think that that would probably be something that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8049)|
| 2:14:14| With not only the contract with the Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8054)|
| 2:14:19| but also the involvement of DNARC and its partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8059)|
| 2:14:25| Barton Mello and EDMI, as well as a project manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8065)|
| 2:14:31| One of the partners in the project manager group is a firm from Nashville that also has a DBE experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8071)|
| 2:14:41| They're already providing coordination and input into the DBE effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8081)|
| 2:14:49| even before the agreements are actually approved and entered into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8089)|
| 2:14:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| And I can follow up with Ms. Nichols as well on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8096)|
| 2:14:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8098)|
| 2:15:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8100)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8101)|
| 2:15:03| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8104)|
| 2:15:07| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8107)|
| 2:15:09| While trying to get the maximum amount of public benefit out of this possible project, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8109)|
| 2:15:15| one thing I did want to mention was the discussion about the intermodal transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| the greenways, the sidewalks connecting to existing public transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| For me, that's a very big part of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8127)|
| 2:15:30| And like some of the others at the beginning, I was a bit skeptical about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8130)|
| 2:15:36| My starting point is that generally I'm against public subsidies of professional sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8136)|
| 2:15:41| That was my starting point, and I've made that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8141)|
| 2:15:45| However, you know, my idea was, you know, show me a public benefit that outweighs that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8145)|
| 2:15:52| and, you know, we'll talk and I'll be supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8152)|
| 2:15:55| And this project has shown a lot of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8155)|
| 2:16:00| Mr. Boyd has been generous in many ways as far as the property that will be given to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8160)|
| 2:16:11| the clearing of the property, which is something that's not generally done, I don't think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8171)|
| 2:16:18| when someone gifts property to a public institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8178)|
| 2:16:23| So many of my questions have already been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| What I'm doing now is kind of honing in on those areas that I still have questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8186)|
| 2:16:31| and I'm still trying to get some grasp of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8191)|
| 2:16:34| Some of it is related to the minority hiring percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| Those efforts that have been made, I absolutely applaud those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8199)|
| 2:16:42| I think that's a starting point for us that we need to establish as far as local employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8202)|
| 2:16:51| But I also want to expand beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8211)|
| 2:16:55| And so my question, it may be for Mr. Boyd or whoever he directs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8215)|
| 2:17:00| but my question is what assurances or what efforts are being made to make accessible these construction jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8220)|
| 2:17:13| and continuing employment for local residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8233)|
| 2:17:18| And, of course, that has a great benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8238)|
| 2:17:21| You know, number one, folks in our community who need jobs are going to be able to get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8241)|
| 2:17:28| And then number two, if they get the jobs, of course, they're going to be spending the money within the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8248)|
| 2:17:34| But my question is what efforts and what assurances are being made that the people who build this stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8254)|
| 2:17:43| and work there afterwards are going to be from our community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8263)|
| 2:17:56| Thank you, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| I'm having Brandy Boyd with Boyd Sports and with Phyllis Nichols with Knox Area Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| We'll tag-team this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| I want to talk about the continuing efforts going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8283)|
| 2:18:06| So I should have mentioned this at the start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| but the very first business that we recruited to be a retailer there is a place called Jackie's Dream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8289)|
| 2:18:14| It's an African-American-owned restaurant that all the employees are also African-American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8294)|
| 2:18:21| I think they're going to have a tremendous success in this new location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8301)|
| 2:18:24| just an example of our intentionality in trying to find businesses from the community that will hire people from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8304)|
| 2:18:31| We've put this stadium, this whole project, next to, within walking distance of where people can come and find these jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8311)|
| 2:18:39| We can't guarantee that they'll walk to the stadium and take the jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| but we're going to do everything we can to try to recruit them, to train them, and to make this available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| And as we've talked about multiple times, we're already making lots of efforts in trying to make sure that people are aware of the jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8328)|
| 2:18:55| and they're getting trained for the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| Maybe with that, I'll share with my partner, Dr. Urban-Lee, share some of the efforts that she's doing specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8337)|
| 2:19:04| So we're concerned as well that this is not a one-time and one-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8344)|
| 2:19:10| meaning that people work the construction job at the stadium and then they move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| And typically with construction jobs, people work the job and then they move to wherever the job is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8357)|
| 2:19:26| Our focus has been to make sure that we are training people who live here so that they have those skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8366)|
| 2:19:34| because we know Knoxville is primed for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| All you have to look is the billion-dollar development project that happens on the University of Tennessee campus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8377)|
| 2:19:46| and that is continuously happening, and know that we don't have the skilled workforce that's taking advantage of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8386)|
| 2:19:54| So one of the things that we have been doing is to make sure that our DBEs can compete on the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8394)|
| 2:20:01| and that they have straight trade training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8401)|
| 2:20:04| So we've had meetings with the state, with our workforce board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8404)|
| 2:20:08| and trade skill trainers to discuss both short-term, mid-term, and long-term options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8408)|
| 2:20:17| so that we can train pre-apprentices in the short term that can do the construction work and be intermediate craftsmen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8417)|
| 2:20:28| One of the things, how do you ensure that you have used the local workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8428)|
| 2:20:35| is that they know that they are assured of more than a short-term job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8435)|
| 2:20:41| And so we are working not just with this big project, but the Urban League has relationships with other construction firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8441)|
| 2:20:48| other projects, because everybody right now has a demand for workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8448)|
| 2:20:54| And believe it or not, people are interested in DBE on their project as well, and they come to the Urban League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8454)|
| 2:21:01| So we don't see this as, again, a one-on-one-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8461)|
| 2:21:07| This is a way to make an impact with people who live here and who want to stay here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8467)|
| 2:21:15| but they have to have a path so that a path to, we call it a path to, a path of empowerment and self-sufficiency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8475)|
| 2:21:23| They see how they can move up in the career ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| And our constructions training is certified by the National Center for Construction Education and Research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8487)|
| 2:21:34| It is an industry-recognized credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| So if they work on the stadium, they're going to be recognized with other construction firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8497)|
| 2:21:44| and will be readily accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8504)|
| 2:21:46| We've already spoken with many construction firms who accept these credentials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8506)|
| 2:21:54| Just a bit as an aside, that construction industry quite often by nature is somewhat transitory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8514)|
| 2:22:03| I've had experience with that years ago in my youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8523)|
| 2:22:07| And quite often people come from all over the country to work on a particular site and then they move around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8527)|
| 2:22:16| And that provides employment, of course, but our charge is to do what's best for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| And so we want as many of those jobs as possible to be based here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8543)|
| 2:22:29| And I know you understand that, but I wanted to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8549)|
| 2:22:32| And this is a conversation, you know, that I think we will continue to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| and make our best efforts to try to assure that the local workforce has access to employment opportunities with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8557)|
| 2:22:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8569)|
| 2:22:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8570)|
| 2:22:51| I would like to mention just one other thing, because I did mention before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| but just to reemphasize elite diversified construction is a locally-owned minority business that's headquartered on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8573)|
| 2:23:00| It's already been subcontracted to be a part of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| just as a sign of our intentionality and our efforts to make progress in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8588)|
| 2:23:10| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8590)|
| 2:23:12| Councilmember Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8592)|
| 2:23:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| Obviously the, you know, big focus, understandably, is around the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-211108-joint-ws?start=8597)|
