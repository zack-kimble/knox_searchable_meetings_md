| 0:01:41| Commissioners, as we gather here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=101)|
| 0:01:43| we find ourselves in the heart of summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=103)|
| 0:01:46| This season, rich with warmth and vibrancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| is a time of growth and renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=108)|
| 0:01:51| Nature is at its peak, with trees full of green leaves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=111)|
| 0:01:55| flowers in bloom, and days extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| into long, golden evenings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=117)|
| 0:01:59| This natural abundance encourages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| us to pause and appreciate the beauty around us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| not only in nature, but also in our community and its people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=124)|
| 0:02:09| So let's take a moment to reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=129)|
| 0:02:11| on the essence of our community and the shared purpose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| brings us together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| In a world that often feels fragmented and hurried,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| our ability to come together as a united group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| is both a privilege and a responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| Community is built on the simple yet profound acts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| of connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| It thrives when we listen with empathy, speak with sincerity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=150)|
| 0:02:34| and act with integrity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=154)|
| 0:02:36| Each of us brings unique strengths, experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| and perspectives to this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=160)|
| 0:02:42| It is through the melding of our individual contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| that we create something greater than the sum of its parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Purpose is what gives our actions direction and meaning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| It is the driving force that propels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| us to strive for betterment, not only for ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| but for the collective good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| Our shared purpose is a beacon guiding us through challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=181)|
| 0:03:05| and celebrating our triumphs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Today, let's commit to fostering an environment where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=188)|
| 0:03:11| everyone feels valued and heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=191)|
| 0:03:13| Let's recognize that our differences are not divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=193)|
| 0:03:16| but opportunities for growth and learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=196)|
| 0:03:18| By embracing the diverse tapestry of our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| we enrich our collective experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| and fortify our common purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| Let us take this opportunity to grow, to live in the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=207)|
| 0:03:32| connect with one another, and reflect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| on all we are thankful for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| May we allow the warmth of summer to fill our hearts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| its brightness to illuminate our paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| and its spirit of renewal to inspire us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=224)|
| 0:03:47| As we proceed with our meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=227)|

| 0:04:17| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| one nation under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=268)|
| 0:04:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| And before we get started formally on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| we're going to also be having a special motion at the end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| by Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=283)|
| 0:04:45| But I would like to open up tonight, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| with the assurance that, barring unforeseen circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| we will all be out of here in time for our 7 o'clock ball| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=291)|
| 0:04:56| game that I think all of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=296)|
| 0:04:59| is so anxiously awaiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| But along those regards, I would just like to make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| and really kind of give a special kudos shout out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| to Visit Knoxville this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| Myself, and I know I saw one other commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| were privileged to attend the US Olympic diving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| trials that occurred this past week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| here on the University of Tennessee campus in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=325)|
| 0:05:29| So I want you all to realize that at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| and those trials were covered by NBC News| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| and they have been featured all throughout the week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| and this weekend on national television.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| So in the span of just a few short days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=342)|
| 0:05:46| our wonderful little community, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=346)|
| 0:05:49| has been featured nationally on the news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| for not only our wonderful baseball team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| and our wonderful baseball program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| through the College World Series,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| but also as hosting Olympic trials for a diving competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| So I just wanted to give kudos for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| involved in this kind of thing and how wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| it is to live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| All right, moving forward, I'm looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| at amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=380)|

| 0:07:47| Yes, and I hope I did say item 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| Oh, you said deferrals were 30 and 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=476)|
| 0:07:57| I meant 35 and 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=477)|
| 0:07:59| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=479)|
| 0:07:59| Thank you for that correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=479)|
| 0:08:01| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| Item 35 and 50, deferred to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| Are there any other comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| Seeing none, can I have a motion for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=489)|

| 0:08:52| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| All right, before we approve the educational government consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| we have a discussion item number 13 being pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=537)|
| 0:09:02| If you would read that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| It's resolution R-24-6-213.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=545)|
| 0:09:09| It's approving the schematic design of the new Farragut Area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| Elementary School by McCarty, Wholesale McCarty Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Mr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| I'd sent him a couple of emails back and forth just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=562)|
| 0:09:25| to elaborate on the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=565)|
| 0:09:29| I'd been a part of several discussions with community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=569)|
| 0:09:32| members and also Mr. Adams in hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| that we could mitigate some of their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and take those into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| during the design phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| So this is the appropriate time to kind of bring those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=581)|
| 0:09:45| So I'm going to let Mr. Adams tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| a little bit about the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And then he has already seen the list of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=590)|
| 0:09:53| that some of the adjacent property owners have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=593)|
| 0:09:56| And then I have just some follow-up, possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| So I'm going to turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Mr. Frazier, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| I don't think your mic is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=605)|
| 0:10:06| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=606)|
| 0:10:07| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=608)|
| 0:10:08| Name and who you are, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=613)|
| 0:10:14| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=614)|
| 0:10:14| My name is Garfield Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| I am the Assistant Superintendent of Operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=616)|
| 0:10:17| with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Madam Chair, County Commissioners, Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| So there were a few questions that were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| One of the biggest questions was the queuing space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=625)|
| 0:10:27| on the actual site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| So with the schematic design, we ensured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| that we don't have a lot of stacking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| of vehicles on the main road, especially Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| So we did design that area to where it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| account for multiple vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=639)|
| 0:10:41| We also ensured that there was a separate site for buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| That's for arrival and dismissal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| to ensure, again, that that area is not congested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| We'll tell you this has been a two-year process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=651)|
| 0:10:54| And Commissioner Schoonmaker can tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| it has been an all-inclusive process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| We've worked very closely with Mayor Williams and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| We've worked very closely with Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| Jim Snowden, Chris Caldwell, and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| our school board, Ms. Horn, and with my team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| to ensure that we accounted for all the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| that the community had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| We had three listening sessions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| And I actually used that to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=677)|
| 0:11:19| with the design of the new Farragut School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| I'm not going to call it anything other than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| The new school in Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| I did not name that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Thank you, Marcus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=688)|
| 0:11:30| So there were some other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| One of the questions were trees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| could be planted to separate the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| from certain areas of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| And that is something that we've worked with Knoxville Trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| That has been a great partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| that we've had with Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| And we've planted several trees across the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| I will tell you that we bring in our security team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| and we consult with Knox County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=711)|
| 0:11:55| and the city of Knoxville to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=715)|
| 0:11:57| that there's no obstruction of the view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| to ensure that the safety of the school is our top priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| But it is also something that we look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=723)|
| 0:12:05| I do believe there was an additional question as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| as the use of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| And again, the use of that road is for the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| to decide that is not Knox County Schools property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| We are working with the Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| to ensure that any widening of the road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=741)|
| 0:12:23| leads out to Knox County, that the school in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| and the drive will be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| I think last but not least was, will the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=750)|
| 0:12:32| be maintained as far as the hay and mowing that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| And it is something that we worked very closely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| with Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| I believe he's already gotten a quote for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| And he's pursuing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| And we'll work directly with his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=764)|
| 0:12:46| to ensure that that area is maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Thank you, Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| Just for commission's sake, just to give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| We had a great meeting out near the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| with some of the adjacent property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| One of those is here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| And just really wanted to hear and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| from their perspective looking out on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| And some of the things that we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| if you look at the schematic design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Boring Road is actually two roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| And there's also Boring Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Well, the residents had learned that Boring Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| had been turned over to become a public road several years back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| And they actually try to mitigate some of their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| by doing their own work, going to the town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| asking if they could possibly revert Boring Lane back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| to a private drive so that they could put a gate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| And unfortunately, that's not going to be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| So as you might imagine, Boring Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| coming from Kingston Pike and then down to Smith Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| there's only a portion from Boring Road West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| that has actually been widened with curbs and gutters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| And so one of the questions was the bus entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| is actually on the part of Boring Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| from near Boring Lane to Smith Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| That is not a part of those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=843)|
| 0:14:06| Was there any consideration of moving the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| to where the actual road has been widened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| No, and the reason why there was no consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| is because we will not be utilizing that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| And I'll also say Mayor Williams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| he has ensured that he will be purchasing a traffic light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| It has a new software where they'll have access control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| And so again, those are just some other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| where we want to mitigate any congestion in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| And I did talk with the town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| There are no plans for road improvements on Boring Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| It's not in their five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So one of the questions that we also had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=881)|
| 0:14:43| was possible traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Because naturally, when you have adjacent residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| owners, this road is very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| People often mistake it for just a private drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| I don't even think it's standard width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| So they do have very valid concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| about increased traffic coming through Boring Road, possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| coming into Boring Lane, which again, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| used to be a private drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| And so these are things that we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| do hope that as the design phase continues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| we will take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=919)|
| 0:15:21| And yes, they did ask for a planted buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| along Boring Road from Kingston Pike to Boring Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| You'll see where the proposed future use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| is our athletic fields, just to give them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=930)|
| 0:15:33| a little bit more privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| So let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| What else did we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| Also, do you have any idea what the capacity of this school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| and projected enrollments are going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| So we're still working with Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| as far as the capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| And we are working, when I say we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| the curriculum instruction team, along with my operations team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| to really look at what capacity is within schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| We consider programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| I will say in the past, in a former life, I was a principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| And so we have not taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| in the past the programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| And so that's something that a committee is forming right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=974)|
| 0:16:16| to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| But we did build this school to where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| capacity would be at 1,200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Again, that could vary anywhere from 1,000 to 1,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| depending on what the committee decided with the programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| But we wanted to ensure that it did have sufficient space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| within the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| And then how many cars do you anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| in the queue for the parent entrance coming off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| of Village Commonway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Do you have any idea how many cars that queue will hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| We do not have the exact number of vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1001)|
| 0:16:44| But it is comparable to the students attending the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1008)|
| 0:16:48| And then also the same for the bus entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| How many buses can be in that queue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| There will be no stacking of buses other than that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| So the bunch of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1017)|
| 0:16:57| But coming in the bus entrance, down through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| several buses can be stacked near the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| waiting for students to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| There will be no buses sitting on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| There is enough space, adequate space, for all buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1027)|
| 0:17:09| to be safely on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1031)|
| 0:17:11| And you did state that there is a traffic signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| I do want to give one of the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| just 30 seconds or a minute, if you have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| that you'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| And I will continue to work, hopefully, with you, Mr. Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| in expressing their concerns and just following the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| That field has been mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Jim was gracious enough to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| And so I'm really glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| And also, Boring Road, as it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| is the responsibility of the town of Farragut, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| So if any additional improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| need to make as a result of traffic generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| by the school, it will be their responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| And I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1075)|
| 0:17:55| We just received a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1075)|
| 0:17:59| And so we will be reconvening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| We've met with Mayor Williams and his team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| Knox County government, and of course, my team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| And we've been waiting on the traffic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| study that came in last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| And so next week, we're looking to reconvene again and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| I will say, again, it has been a partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| I don't want to say it's one entity or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| We've worked very well together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| And I would love to continue that positive working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you, Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Will you send me that traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| I can send it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| You might want to just come to the meeting, because it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| little convoluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Just let me know when the meeting is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1116)|
| 0:18:38| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1118)|
| 0:18:38| You're more than welcome to come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| And I can certainly share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1122)|
| 0:18:42| Thank you very much for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1123)|
| 0:18:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Thank you, Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Commissioner Frazier, did you want your homeowner to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Oh, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Mr. Garfield, can you also confirm that per the new policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| that was put in last year, that the school be built with a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| playground already included in the capital budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| That is included in the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1147)|
| 0:19:09| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1155)|
| 0:19:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1157)|
| 0:19:17| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| I'm looking for a motion, please, to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| educational consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Motion by Frazier, second by Schoonmaker to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1166)|

| 0:31:58| didn't come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| His name was Zachary Gerber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1919)|

| 0:32:04| into every question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1924)|

| 0:32:09| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1929)|

| 0:32:18| are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| But I ended up really liking the competitive part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| So yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1942)|

| 0:32:34| at Hardin Valley Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=1954)|

| 0:34:09| Thank you. Thank you, guys. I know this is a lot on a hot summer day. Appreciate you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2049)|
| 0:34:29| very much. Next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| Presentation regarding Junior Achievement. Commissioner Frazier, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. As I mentioned during our agenda review, I had invited the Executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| Director, Callie Archer, to come and tell us a little bit about the programs and services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2083)|
| 0:34:47| provided by Junior Achievement of East Tennessee. This body was very implemental in just providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| an opportunity for all fifth graders across Knox County, the opportunity to attend BizTown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2094)|
| 0:35:01| if they so choose. And so I asked Callie to come and just share a little bit about last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| year and how that worked and just provide us with any additional information. I'm a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| big fan of Junior Achievement, as I know Commissioner Durrett is as well. So thank you for being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2111)|
| 0:35:17| here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| Well, thank you, Commissioner Frazier and Madam Chair. Thank you for hosting me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| I'm happy to be here and talk to you all. Before I jump in, who has been to BizTown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2122)|
| 0:35:27| and seen it in action or volunteered? Okay, awesome. Well, for those who are not as familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| or if it's been a minute since you've been there, I'm going to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| how Knox County funded 3,758 fifth graders to participate in this Foundational Career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2138)|
| 0:35:46| Exploration Work Readiness Program this past year. And so we were really excited to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2146)|
| 0:35:52| this partnership because this is part of a greater plan that we really have with Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| County Schools. So I saw that they already snuck out, but we are working in tandem to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2156)|
| 0:36:02| make sure that these children are prepared for making serious life decisions and decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| about academies as they go into that. And then we also are working with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| Schools to meet other curriculum and needs within the community and facilitating some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2173)|
| 0:36:19| really important work readiness things at other key decision-making points in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| children's educational journey. So this is, I'm going to talk mostly about BizTown, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| again, this is part of a much bigger picture. This is just that foundational career exploration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| thing. So JA BizTown is a simulated mini-town. They get to run businesses, manage finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| They get to interact with their customers. It is real world in every single way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| we can make it. Well, except for the fake money. It costs real money to get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2206)|
| 0:36:52| They get to play with fake money. The students actually start this BizTown experience back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2212)|
| 0:36:57| in the classroom with their classroom teachers, who we provide curriculum and workbooks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2217)|
| 0:37:02| tools for their classroom and training, of course. And so they start that in the classroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| where the students learn all about the rights and responsibility of citizenship and why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| voting is important. Something I think everybody in this room can agree upon that students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| need to hear that from adults and learn how that works. Things like paying taxes. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| things that people in this room can all agree on are important. They also just understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| the way an economy works and how businesses and individuals are interdependent on each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| other and just learning these basic skills in the fifth grade so that as they're learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| other things through other activities that they participate in, they're able to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| that foundational knowledge and understand the way an economy and the world works. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2261)|
| 0:37:47| then they also were just learning about how to operate a business. So they go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| and they have to not only apply for and then get assigned a job where they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| make either $8.50 or $9, so big money we're talking here, per pay period. But they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| assigned those jobs. So basically before they come, they've already done all of this work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| in the classroom, laying those foundational skills. And then they get to come to a four-hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| visit at J.A. BizTown where they get to put those things into practice and actually have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| a four-hour learning lab experience. And it's kind of a little crash course of their first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| day on the job. They're kind of that entree into the real world and what being an adult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| is like. So we do get a lot of comments and they're like, adulting is hard. We hear that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| almost daily. Or my other favorite that I heard recently at the end of school, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| guy said, I can't wait to show my Nana I'm a real man now. I have a debit card. So just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| really incredible learning things happen there. We have a lot of great regional representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| in our city. So we have Pilot, Home Federal, Phillips and Jordan, Stowers-Catt, Y-12, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| National Lab, Clayton Homes, University of Tennessee, 3M, and so many more. And these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| are people and businesses and organizations that invest their private dollars into making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| sure that our students are prepared for the workforce because they know that these kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| can be in their workforce in the next five to 10 years. So it's really important because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2354)|
| 0:39:19| everybody's like, why fifth grade? Well, first of all, fifth graders are still really cute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| and fun. And they're still at that moment where they're absorbing and it's just a really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2362)|
| 0:39:29| great, they kind of will play pretend a little bit with us in some of these ways, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| also are starting to really think, oh, maybe I want to work at Y-12. Maybe I want to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| at the, or go to school at the University of Tennessee, you know, go Vols. So again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| just planting a lot of those seeds in the fifth grade. So during the day they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| maintain their personal finances and their time management. So they're practicing all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| of those skills. Professionalism is another one. Public speaking is something that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| have to practice. And then as a business team, their number one goal is to do all their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| assignments and then pay off their business loan as a group. So again, just this really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| great wraparound overview of the way the world works. So while they're in the city, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2409)|
| 0:40:13| do have the opportunity to vote about things in their BizTown experience. And this is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| a couple of the voting said from Knox County schools, fifth graders specifically. Eighty-five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2418)|
| 0:40:24| percent said that BizTown made learning exciting. Seventy percent of the BizTown citizens said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| that it made them think about what kind of career that they would like to have, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| is really amazing, getting 70 plus percent of a group of students being like, oh, I could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2432)|
| 0:40:39| do that job one day. And then 41 percent of the participants said that BizTown made them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| think about becoming an entrepreneur or owning their own business. So again, economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| that is, you know, small businesses are vital to that and the foundation of that. So these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2450)|
| 0:40:56| are just a few of the takeaways from the local surveys that we did. At a national level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| we also see similar results with our national alumni reports. So from the national alumni| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| reports, they look at JA alumni who get this type of experience versus the average American.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| And it comes out to where a JA alumni is more likely to graduate from high school. They're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| more likely to get an advanced degree. They are more likely to own a home earlier than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| the average American. And they're less likely to live paycheck to paycheck. So again, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2485)|
| 0:41:31| those economic factors that we really, really want to see. So bottom line, you all are helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2491)|
| 0:41:39| invest in the future workforce and the citizenry of Knox County. And I'm just really thrilled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2499)|
| 0:41:45| that you all have made that step and are supporting this as much as our local businesses and community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| members are. So first, just an appreciation to each of you who value that as much as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2511)|
| 0:41:57| do. And thank you for Commissioner Frazier having us here today. So I'm happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you. Any questions? Commissioner Frazier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you, Callie. It really is a special organization. And it just, you know, when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2531)|
| 0:42:20| we started talking about the 865 Academies and creating a pipeline here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| for our future workforce and also career exploration at younger ages, we were very concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| how are we going to do that at the elementary level. And BizTown came to mind. And so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2552)|
| 0:42:37| kind of started those discussions. But it's a phenomenal program, phenomenal people. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| you haven't been there, please go. The last time I was there, the peers, the fifth grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| peers elected a young man who was nonverbal for the first seven years of his life. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2569)|
| 0:42:57| to see him stand up and lead, you know, that just really hit home for me. So thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| for all that you do. You're constantly striving to be better, do better, offer better services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| and programs. The group at JA, they worked their tail off to make this the absolute best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2588)|
| 0:43:15| experience possible for these students. And I'm really grateful for all of you. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| Thank you. Thank you so much. Our next agenda item is public forum. This is specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2602)|
| 0:43:30| addressing agenda items. Is Dawn Close here? All right. Ms. Scheib, I don't believe you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2610)|
| 0:43:45| specifically addressing an agenda item, but as a courtesy, if you all do not object, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2625)|
| 0:43:51| like to go ahead and allow her to come forward and speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2631)|
| 0:44:00| Just give us your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2640)|
| 0:44:09| Vivian Scheib, Knox County. I want to take a few minutes to come to talk to you about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| something very important. I came to talk to you about the kids in the gap. I want to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| to you about kids who are 14 and 15 who are saying, I need money to help my family. Can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| you give me something to do? See, I had talked to Dr. Lundy earlier. When I was 12, I started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2668)|
| 0:44:35| working. I worked with CAC, 14. I'm dipping ice cream at Kay's Ice Cream Pack and ice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-240624?start=2675)|
