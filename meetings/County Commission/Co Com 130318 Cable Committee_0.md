| 0:01:16| Back at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=76)|
| 0:01:17| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| The nomination is second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=81)|
| 0:01:23| The nomination is ceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=83)|
| 0:01:24| He be elected by acclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=84)|
| 0:01:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=86)|
| 0:01:27| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| We have a chairman, a vice chairman, and a secretary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| The next on the agenda is a discussion regarding the contract with Comcast Cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| Mr. Buick, is there we currently have a franchise agreement in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=98)|
| 0:01:43| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| When the law changed, everybody except Comcast went under the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| They had the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Comcast has not gone with the state option, which means we have a contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| Which is going basically month to month on what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=116)|
| 0:02:00| They want to negotiate and get something in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| And the sense of a couple of the commissioners I've talked to is, yes, we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| So that's where we need to go and set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=130)|
| 0:02:14| And Mr. Owen B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=134)|
| 0:02:17| I can't remember the name of the gentleman I've met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| Russell what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Russell Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| Oh, there he is, Russell Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=144)|
| 0:02:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| We met, the law department met with Mr. Byrd and Mr. Owen B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=146)|
| 0:02:30| Probably six, seven, eight months ago and got a little bit of a handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=150)|
| 0:02:35| But this committee, I think, and Mr. Byrd is a good man to talk to and he's straight up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=155)|
| 0:02:40| And if this committee sets up a time, he'll come and talk to you and we'll get a contract worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=160)|
| 0:02:47| Commissioner Owen B.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| Yeah, I just wanted to thank you, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| Give you a little run down of the history of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| I believe, if I'm correct, Russell, correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=177)|
| 0:03:00| We've been a month-to-month on this contract since 07, 06, roughly in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=180)|
| 0:03:07| So you're talking seven years that we've been month-to-month on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=187)|
| 0:03:14| And I think it's really to the community's benefit as well as to Comcast to finalize this contract one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=194)|
| 0:03:26| Or if we can't come to an agreement, then, you know, then they can opt out and go to the state contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| The only thing is if they go into the state contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=212)|
| 0:03:35| you're talking about a lot of revenue that will go to the state and will not come here locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=215)|
| 0:03:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| So that's the reason I think we need to start negotiations and get this settled where it's a two or three or whatever contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=220)|
| 0:03:50| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Yeah, I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| I talked to one of the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=233)|
| 0:03:56| You know, we get these letters from time to time about a complaint, either about charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| or excessive charges or how something is handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| Actually, I talked with the law director before the meeting started about this and how those complaints are handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=245)|
| 0:04:13| I guess the only contract we have is with Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| And all of these others would have to be referred to the state for action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| But if we do have a Comcast customer who has a complaint about something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=261)|
| 0:04:25| would they bring this to this committee or how do we handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=265)|
| 0:04:28| Because I believe this is the first time this committee has met in the five years that I've been down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=268)|
| 0:04:33| I don't recall us doing it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| And, you know, we would have to meet more often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| Do we need to call a special meeting to hear that complaint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=277)|
| 0:04:40| I'm probably addressing this more to the law director or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| But if we do have a complaint from Comcast, who do we refer it to for action if it deals with what the citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| and customer perceives as excessive charges or an improper charge or a conflict that they may have with Comcast?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=292)|
| 0:05:01| I think right now those letters go over to Russell, and Russell responds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=301)|
| 0:05:08| And I think any conflict after that would probably be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| but let's see if the law director has a conflict with the contract, if I'm correct, Mr. Butte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| That's correct, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| Comcast is obviously handling their complaints, because if not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| then it would come to the law director to see if that was a violation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| or a breach of one of the terms of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| We haven't gotten anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=330)|
| 0:05:32| So it's my assumption Comcast has been handling those complaints in-house satisfactorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=332)|
| 0:05:38| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| To the law director to determine if there's a breach, which we would need to bring to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=341)|
| 0:05:48| And I don't know if anyone's out there, but I'll apologize because I fought all of the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| because this committee has not met in over five years or maybe somebody out there who I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=353)|
| 0:05:57| who I've talked to on the telephone within the last two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| But what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=361)|
| 0:06:03| Was it you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Okay, well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| I apologize to you because I thought this is the first time this committee has met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| since I've been down here over five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=368)|
| 0:06:11| And I do know now, just like you may have learned, who we need to refer these to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| and what we need to do to try to solve any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=383)|
| 0:06:25| The suggestion I was going to make is that could flow through rather than having a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=385)|
| 0:06:31| the executive committee who would refer it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| But if it's been working the way it is, you know, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=394)|
| 0:06:39| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| A couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| First of all, I've had probably about a half a dozen calls about Comcast maybe in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=404)|
| 0:06:52| And I have referred those to Russell and the people at Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| And to my knowledge, they've been handled satisfactorily because I've always told them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=415)|
| 0:06:59| if you don't get satisfaction, call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=419)|
| 0:07:01| I've never gotten a call back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| But I have checked with Russell from time to time, and apparently they've been handled satisfactorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=423)|
| 0:07:06| And so, you know, I just wanted to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| And I don't know if other commissioners have called them or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| but I know that every time I've called, it has been taken care of and it's been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| Secondly, I guess, Russell, could I ask you a quick question about Comcast versus Charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Now, have you all merged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| It's my understanding that Comcast and Charter have merged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| What I guess 15 or 18 months ago, we consolidated the Comcast and the Charter Spotlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=447)|
| 0:07:37| and the Charter Advertising Sales Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=457)|
| 0:07:39| So instead of Charter going out selling ads on ESPN and Comcast doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=459)|
| 0:07:46| we merged those two entities together into just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| Still, their revenue, the revenue that we sell that runs on the Charter system still goes to Charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| and is accounted for as Charter revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| And then what we sell or run on our system is still revenue that goes to either the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=476)|
| 0:08:04| or any of the other local franchising authorities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| But it was only for advertising sales revenue only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| So who provides cable service in Knox County other than Comcast and Charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Does Knowledgey still provide any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| To what extent, I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| What about AT&T?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Oh, actually, AT&T is in the city and the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| So we have Comcast, Charter, AT&T, and Knowledgey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| And I would say in the areas of Farragut, TDS Telecom offers service in the town of Farragut as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=513)|
| 0:08:40| And there could be some folks where they have their cable and telephone service that are outside of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| limits of Farragut that would be in the county as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| But that would be handled by Farragut, basically, if it were in Farragut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=531)|
| 0:08:54| If it was in Farragut, it would be Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| But, for example, if they offered, let's say they were on North Shore right at Pellissippi up there where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=536)|
| 0:09:05| new Publix is, I believe that's in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| Any of the customers that they have in that area would be the franchise fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| and things for that area should be coming to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| And I'm not going to say that only as a rough example because I'm not sure if that's in the city limits or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| But if there's something out in that general area, then it would be, if it's not in the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=560)|
| 0:09:26| or the city limits of Farragut, then that would be a Knox County franchise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| So TDS and Charter and Knology and AT&T all have a charter with the state or a contract with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| You know, I'm not certain about TDS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| I know for a fact that Charter took all of their franchises across the entire state to the state-issued certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| I know that AT&T did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| And then I know that the month after Knology's franchise expired with Knox County, they went to the state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| So I'm thinking that might have been in 2010 for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| And I have information at my office, but I don't recall specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| But all of those are with the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Russell, could you give your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=611)|
| 0:10:12| Yes, it's Russell Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=612)|
| 0:10:13| I'm the Senior Director of Government and Public Affairs for Comcast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| And my address is 5720 Asheville Highway, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37924.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=616)|
| 0:10:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I just wanted to clarify one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| The cable committee TV has met in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| It was a little smaller than it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| There was only, I think, only three or four members at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| It's been a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| But I remember Mr. Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| And I think folks from Knology showed up as well and the community TV gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=642)|
| 0:10:51| I agree with the fact that, you know, this committee has not really handled complaints per se,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=651)|
| 0:10:59| but it was more of an informational meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| And we discussed the state versus the county contracts and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=663)|
| 0:11:09| I think we've had two meetings since I've been on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| It was a five-member group, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=673)|
| 0:11:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=675)|
| 0:11:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=676)|
| 0:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Is there anybody here from the public that would like to speak or provide to adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=679)|
| 0:11:22| Is there any new business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| Do you want to speak, sir, or are you satisfied with what you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Any other new business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| There's a movement for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130318CableCommittee?start=698)|
