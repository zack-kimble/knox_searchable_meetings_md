| 0:00:30| On February 22nd, 2022 called meeting. Please stand as we observe a moment of silence followed by the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=30)|
| 0:00:46| Please face the flag for the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=49)|
| 0:01:10| So first I just want to thank our superintendent search committee, Chair Satterfield and Ms. Bounds and Ms. Henderson for your work as well as TSBA and our two amazing candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=70)|
| 0:01:25| Board members, do we have a motion to approve the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=85)|
| 0:01:33| Madam Chair, I guess this would be the proper time to ask for this. Could we drop or remove, I guess would be the correct term, board forum? I don't think we need that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=93)|
| 0:01:52| Board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=112)|
| 0:01:57| No, board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=117)|
| 0:02:01| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| So are you making a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| I'll make a motion if you need one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=125)|
| 0:02:07| Okay, so you're making a motion to approve the agenda with the change of dropping board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=132)|
| 0:02:14| So a motion by Mr. McMillan, a second by Ms. Babb. All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=134)|
| 0:02:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=139)|
| 0:02:20| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| Okay, so are we public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| No, we're public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| So, board members, I guess the first order of business after a lengthy discussion with Mr. Dupler is to discuss how we're going to vote tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=150)|
| 0:02:41| When we left Friday, there was a discussion about doing a written ballot and then passing that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=161)|
| 0:02:51| Just a couple of comments on that and I'll let Mr. Dupler speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=171)|
| 0:02:57| Basically, if we do vote in a way that's different than we normally vote, we will have to have a formal motion to vote in that manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=177)|
| 0:03:07| and take a vote on how we're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=187)|
| 0:03:11| So, and this is allowed in Robert's Rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| I will say that according to Robert's Rules, and Ms. Coatney printed this off for me today, voting by ballot says the main, you know, object of this form of voting is secrecy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=194)|
| 0:03:29| For the bylaws do not require the vote to be by ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| It can be ordered by a majority vote or by general consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| Such motions are undebatable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| Voting by ballot is rarely used, if ever, in legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| And I'm going to let Mr. Dupler speak to that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| I will say that I have had some interesting feedback from my own family comparing it to how they vote on reality TV shows such as Survivor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=229)|
| 0:04:02| So, but Mr. Dupler, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| And so I do agree with what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| I do agree with what Robert's Rules provides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| But as you said, it's normally used for secrecy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| Obviously, this board cannot vote in secret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| So if you were to vote and want to use the written ballot method, then those ballots would have to be announced and identified as to who voted for whom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=260)|
| 0:04:35| So that would be the way that you would have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| There is some precedent for this board, but that was back in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| I believe Ms. Owen found some of that information, forwarded it to Terry Coatney, and that was forwarded to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| That was a slightly different circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| Obviously, the Open Meetings Act was not used correctly in that instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| And then, you know, it's debatable as to whether it applied or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| But, I mean, so in any event, as Ms. Christie stated, I mean, you all would have to vote in the affirmative if you want to use the paper ballots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=303)|
| 0:05:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=314)|
| 0:05:20| So does anyone want to make a motion to take this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| I move that we take the vote of the superintendent by written ballot that are created by here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| So we have a motion by Ms. Satterfield and a second by Ms. Babb to do it by written ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=332)|
| 0:05:39| So, Ms. Coatney, do you want to do a roll call on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=345)|
| 0:05:46| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Ms. Horne?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=360)|
| 0:06:02| So we just proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=367)|
| 0:06:17| As the ballots are going out, I took the liberty to pull up on your second slide on your computer the selection criteria for the superintendent search.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=377)|
| 0:06:26| So if you would like to read over that just to glance your ideas and your thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| just to recall to our memory that the selection criteria is what the community at large said that they want to see in a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=390)|
| 0:06:38| So if you need to see that and refresh your memory about what our community said directly to us about what they want in a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| So it is on your second tab on your computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=405)|
| 0:07:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=422)|
| 0:07:03| So if everyone will go ahead and make their selection and Ms. Totney will pick them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=423)|
| 0:07:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=451)|
| 0:08:01| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=481)|
| 0:08:20| Ms. Satterfield votes for Dr. Linda Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=500)|
| 0:08:25| Ms. Owen has written neither and will restart with additional candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=505)|
| 0:08:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=515)|
| 0:08:39| Ms. Owen wrote neither, restart with additional candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=519)|
| 0:08:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| Mr. Watson votes for Dr. Linda Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| Ms. Babb votes for Dr. John Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Ms. Horn votes for Dr. John Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| Ms. Henderson votes for Dr. John Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| Ms. Bounds votes for Dr. John Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=549)|
| 0:09:15| Mr. McMillan votes for Dr. John Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=555)|
| 0:09:20| Ms. Christy votes for Dr. John Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| So total that was six for Dr. Ryswyck, two for Dr. Cash and one passed, I guess it will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=568)|
| 0:09:39| So Dr. Ms. Owen, did you want to change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=579)|
| 0:09:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=586)|
| 0:09:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=587)|
| 0:09:48| Please make my vote Dr. Ryswyck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| Can I entertain a motion to ask the board to vote in support of Dr. John Ryswyck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| I object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=602)|
| 0:10:04| I also object to you allowing Ms. Owen to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| She had the same opportunity that everyone else had and she said neither.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| And after she saw how it went, she wanted to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| I object and I would ask that you adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| I'll be glad to take that back and it can stand as neither, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| Mr. Nibler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| Well, just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| I mean, Madam Chair, I mean you can, I mean you're in charge of the meeting and if somebody takes a pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| I mean I think it's practice of this board to allow that person to reconsider if that person wants to reconsider that pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=636)|
| 0:10:43| Now, I will say this, there's a vote on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| That vote needs to be announced before any other motion comes on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=648)|
| 0:10:53| So that motion is not ripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Mr. Nibler, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| I believe my vote was neither rather than a pass and so I think it should probably stand that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Either way, it was neither and she was assured that Dr. Risewood was the winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=669)|
| 0:11:18| So, therefore, I've never, I've been on several legislative bodies many, many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| and I have never, ever seen them allow somebody to vote while the vote was announced or as it was being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=686)|
| 0:11:39| They always ask before, but once you start voting, you can't change your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| You just lost your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| If you pass, if you said neither, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=709)|
| 0:11:54| She had the same opportunity everybody else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| So, therefore, I would ask that it not be counted and that we adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=719)|
| 0:12:06| So she did withdraw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| And just for the record, though, we do typically go back in our normal meetings for things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=729)|
| 0:12:16| So we have six votes for Dr. Risewood, two for Dr. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=736)|
| 0:12:23| And so Dr. Risewood is our next superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| Congratulations, Dr. Risewood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=752)|
| 0:12:42| Madam Chair, I would like to offer a motion for the board to be able to vote and show its support and solidarity for Dr. John Risewood as the next superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=762)|
| 0:12:50| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| We have a motion by Mr. Watson and a second by Ms. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=772)|
| 0:12:57| Are we going to have a discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Yes, we can have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| I would just like to know what the point is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=780)|
| 0:13:05| If you think you're showing unity, I beg to differ with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=785)|
| 0:13:10| You had the same opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| If you wanted to vote for Dr. Cash, I mean Dr. Risewood, excuse me, you had the same opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=792)|
| 0:13:20| I see no point in taking another vote after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| You all had this planned out the whole time to make it some kind of a show or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=806)|
| 0:13:33| I don't know what you're planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=813)|
| 0:13:35| But nevertheless, I will not willingly be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=815)|
| 0:13:41| Ms. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| I would like to address what you talked about, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| I, coming into this, felt like we would have not a unanimous vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| But I have 100 percent said, no matter who got it, I thought we had two great candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| And at the end of the day, whoever won a majority, I did want to show 100 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| And I think that's where Mr. Watson's comes from, is they might have put a vote out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| but I think everyone wants to show that we are, as a board, behind the person that the majority voted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| So that's how I am taking Mr. Watson's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| And, I mean, you might see it differently, but I think it's our ability to try to show unity of our board at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=857)|
| 0:14:25| And I know that you disagree with that, but that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| I disagree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| And beyond that, you know, I see that it, I have no doubt about what this board will unify behind Dr. Ryswick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=870)|
| 0:14:46| but I don't think it's necessary to take a public vote after you've voted against the man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| I just think that's, I really think it's morally wrong to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| But that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| You all do, if you have enough votes, other members, you do what you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| So, Ms. Cutman, we have a motion and a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Do you want to read the motion that Mr. Watson made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=916)|
| 0:15:26| Mr. Watson's motion was a support of solidarity for Dr. Ryswick, a superintendent, and it was seconded by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=926)|
| 0:15:35| So we should probably do a roll call vote on this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=935)|
| 0:15:40| Just let me clarify that what you're voting on is to then take another vote in solidarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=940)|
| 0:15:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| But it doesn't change the outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| The original outcome? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| Is that even legal, Mr. Dupre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| You all can take votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| I mean, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| We can vote on anything we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| Yeah, yeah, but the first vote's already in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| It's official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| That was my whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Can you just say the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=973)|
| 0:16:14| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| So Mr. Watson's motion was for a support of solidarity for Dr. Ryswick, a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| To take a vote of solidarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=985)|

| 0:16:27| My motion is to take a vote of solidarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| I think that's the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| My motion is to take a vote of support of solidarity for Dr. Ryswick, a superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=992)|
| 0:16:37| And it was seconded by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=1001)|

| 0:17:08| Ms. Satterfield, would you like to change your pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=1028)|

| 0:17:24| And we have removed board forum from our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| That was a motion to take a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-220222-special?start=1051)|
