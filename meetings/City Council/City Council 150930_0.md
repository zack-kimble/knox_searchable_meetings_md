| 0:00:00| I'll call this meeting to order. This is the Wednesday, we're actually meeting on a Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=0)|
| 0:00:05| instead of our normal Tuesday night, September 30th, 2015, meeting of Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5)|
| 0:00:12| We appreciate everybody who's here with us tonight and anybody who may be watching from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=12)|
| 0:00:17| home. We will start with the invocation given by Councilman Della Vopi and the pledge will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=17)|
| 0:00:23| be led by Councilman Grave. Heavenly Father, we've come before you this evening to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=23)|
| 0:00:34| with our citizens and residents of this community and to hear their requests and their complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| and we ask that you give us the opportunity to listen carefully to what they say and wisdom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=42)|
| 0:00:50| to exercise judgment on behalf of the whole community. We're also concerned about conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=50)|
| 0:00:59| in the world as wars in the Middle East seem to be ramping up and things seem to be spinning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=59)|
| 0:01:05| out of control and we all pray for peace and that these matters will be resolved and finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=65)|
| 0:01:13| we ask that you help us be mindful of those less fortunate than ourselves. Amen. Let us salute our flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=73)|
| 0:01:21| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=81)|
| 0:01:29| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=89)|

| 0:02:02| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The minutes are approved. Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=122)|
| 0:02:09| Items to be postponed or items to be added by motion? Okay, we have our consent items. 11D| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=129)|
| 0:02:17| is a certificate of compliance. 11E through K are pensions and 12A through E are 202s. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| Second. We have a motion and a second. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=145)|
| 0:02:31| For the mayor's report, I first wanted to say a few words about yesterday's primary election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| As I said last night, I deeply, truly appreciate the opportunity to continue in this office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=156)|
| 0:02:43| for another four years for a second term. I love my job. This is a great job and a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=163)|
| 0:02:49| responsibility and I'm looking forward to everything that we can accomplish working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=169)|
| 0:02:53| together at the community and council over these next four years. I do want to remind everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| that while the mayor's race is over, there are still four city council seats on the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=178)|
| 0:03:04| in November. And these are very important races, not just for the four of you who are sitting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| here on the ballot, but for really the future of our city. I really want everybody, I encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=189)|
| 0:03:15| everybody to get out and vote. Tell your friends and neighbors, remind them that there's still the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| general election. The early voting for general election will start in two weeks on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| October 14th, and that continues through October 29th. And then election day is Tuesday, November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=206)|
| 0:03:34| 3rd. So the four count, the mayor's race is decided, the city judge's race is decided, but the four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| council positions will be on the ballot. And you can find information about early voting locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=220)|
| 0:03:46| and the sample ballot on the website of the Knox County Election Commission, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| knoxcounty.org slash election. And I also want to talk about some good news from our Office of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Special Events. The Market Square Fall Concert Series is back for a run of five shows on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| Thursdays through the month of October, starting tomorrow night, October 1st. The series is sponsored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| by the City of Knoxville and the CBID, the Central Business Improvement District, and it includes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| variety of music, jazz, swing, bluegrass, pop, and folk rock. All concerts are free and they begin at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=257)|
| 0:04:24| 7 p.m. on the pavilion on Market Square. There will be no food or alcohol sold on the square during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=264)|
| 0:04:32| the concerts, apart from what is available on the patios of restaurants, and of course we encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| people to patronize the restaurants that are there. But concert goers are invited to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| chairs or blankets to sit on the square and to enjoy the shows. Now the series kicks off at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=283)|
| 0:04:49| tomorrow with the Marble City Shooters, which is, I'm told, a pop, hot jazz, and swing group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| And one show to especially look forward to is on October 22nd, when Knoxville's finest band| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=296)|
| 0:05:05| will be playing. This is a group made up of members of the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| and they will be doing a variety of pop hits. So this sounds like another challenge to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| fire department, Chief Sharp. We could have a battle of the bands, so we'll be looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| to that at a future series, a concert series. You could call that Guns and Hoses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=320)|
| 0:05:28| We've got to give it to him for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=328)|
| 0:05:30| Okay, get that to Judith. Okay, get that to our special event, Guns and Hoses. Okay, I'm impressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=330)|
| 0:05:40| I'm telling you, that's good. That's off the cuff there. That's good. Okay, so anyway, you can find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| out more information about all of the shows on our website at knoxvilletn.gov slash events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| Guns and Hoses, okay. So that's the end of my report of reports from council. Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| Mayor Brown? Yes, Mayor, I'd like to announce I'll be hosting a meeting on Thursday, October the 15th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=359)|
| 0:06:06| at the O'Connor Center to discuss. There's been an initiative for historic zoning in the Park Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=366)|
| 0:06:13| neighborhood, and Kay Graybill of MPC will be our speaker, and I'd like to invite anyone who would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=373)|
| 0:06:20| like to attend to that meeting, October 15th, 6 p.m. 6 p.m. 6 p.m. O'Connor Center. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=380)|
| 0:06:29| Councilwoman Palmer? Thank you. Tomorrow night at five, beginning at 5 30 till about 7 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| Cumberland Estates West Neighborhood Association or Neighborhood Watch is having their annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| Chili Fest. They've added hot dogs this year. Generally, we have a good turnout of people who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=401)|
| 0:06:47| live in that area and also of different leaders throughout the city and the county, so I look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=407)|
| 0:06:54| forward to seeing everyone there tomorrow night. Thank you. Vice Mayor? Yeah, thank you, Madam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Mayor. I just want to, on behalf of the council, congratulate you on your re-election. You've done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=419)|
| 0:07:06| a very good job and warranted the re-election, and we look forward, I look forward for two more years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| is all I have left, some of us, but, you know, I also want to congratulate the ones around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=431)|
| 0:07:17| dice here that progressed to the general election, and I also want to appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=437)|
| 0:07:25| ones who didn't make it, because it's a hard, long process, a lot of scrutiny, and you really open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| yourself up, and anybody that gets in that process, I really truly appreciate that, so congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=451)|

| 0:08:53| Chapter 2, Article 9, Section 2-1076 regarding the Special Assessment Levy in the Central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Business Improvement District. Move for approval. Second. Councilman Dela Ropey. Yes, I know I struck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| out on this last time, but I'm going to make a suggestion simply on a language change, and if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| turn to packet page 23 in 9A, in the, I guess we should say the last sentence, but in the third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=552)|
| 0:09:21| line there, the last sentence reads, if the assessment abatement is approved by City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| sorry, if the assessment abatement is approved by City Council, the assessment abatement shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=568)|
| 0:09:34| continue for the term of the pilot or TIF agreement, and then it has a semicolon and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=574)|
| 0:09:41| other language, and I would add right after pilot or TIF agreement, comma, or such lesser time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| period as Council shall approve, comma, and the reason I suggest that, I won't go into a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| deal because we spoke about it last time, but it seems to me that to make it mandatory for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| full term of the pilot or TIF without a council engaging in an assessment as to whether that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=599)|
| 0:10:06| prudent or not doesn't make sense, so this just gives us a little broader discretion to do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| full term of the pilot or TIF or such lesser time as we decide is prudent, and I don't see how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| hurts anything, but it certainly gives this council a chance to look at it and turn it over and decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| how much of an abatement or in terms of length of time should be allowed, so I'm going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=623)|
| 0:10:30| that that language be added to this provision, and I hope there'll be a second. I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=630)|
| 0:10:40| Okay, I'm going to ask Mr. Swanson to respond. Well, I would point out that the language as it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=640)|
| 0:10:47| currently reads is that if the pilot or TIF is terminated for any reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=647)|
| 0:10:57| then that assessment abatement would stop. The automatic fallout. Yeah, that's automatic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=657)|
| 0:11:03| and frankly, when business people are making decisions about whether to go forward with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| business, I don't know that it's really good policy to have that subject to some subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=668)|
| 0:11:13| vote from council just because council wants to vote to end that assessment for whatever reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=673)|
| 0:11:20| that may be, whether it's for a political reason or for a good faith reason or for a bad faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=680)|
| 0:11:25| reason or for anything else. It certainly doesn't give the business person who's relying upon that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| in order to finance the project the type of security that we want to be able to give our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| business persons, because we do this as an incentive for them to do business in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| of Knoxville, and if we don't give them that sense of security, I am very concerned that they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=699)|
| 0:11:45| going to be able to rely upon it, and more importantly, their financing institutions may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| not be able to rely upon it. Well, I thought this had to come before council in any event because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| it looks like the CBID has to recommend an abatement, and I was simply saying why tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| council's hands when they get the recommendation in front of them they can approve for the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| term or a lesser term, and everyone would know up front what the abatement is and the duration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=726)|
| 0:12:12| and I wasn't trying to address the automatic abatement if the deal falls through, but it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| to me they would know up front, and there are arguments on both sides, but I was suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| leaving council more discretion is not a bad idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=741)|
| 0:12:29| Councilman Steyer. Yeah, I guess I have a question for for Mr. De La Vope. So you're saying that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=749)|
| 0:12:34| mean, because council, we approved the original pilot or TIFs. Right. So you're saying we could we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| would approve like a like a 10-year pilot, but then we would only approve a five-year the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| abatement? Well, that's an example. I wasn't suggesting that that, you know, having anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=765)|
| 0:12:51| but just the particular example they gave in the document, for example, was the Farragut Hotel, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| that would be a 25-year abatement to the CBID, and maybe that's warranted, but without a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=776)|
| 0:13:02| how do we know? And since they are deferring to us, I mean, they're recommending to us that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| supposed to make the actual decision on behalf of the community, I thought we should have we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=788)|
| 0:13:14| have the authority to, you know, move the dial wherever it needed to be, probably exactly what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| they recommend, but there may be cases where it's not. That's the point. Mr. Branscomb. Yeah, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| want to make one comment. By the time those applications are presented and approved and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| studied, I mean, we've done a ton of due diligence before they're ever brought to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| so I'm wondering how you would, at that time, after we've done all the due diligence, talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| whoever is getting this benefit and gone over all the benefits that they would have with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| lender, how you arbitrarily make that decision at a council meeting when we've done all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| due diligence to understand what that needs to be to make the deal work? Well, the way I read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=829)|
| 0:13:54| we could say no, even if you recommended and did all your due diligence, and I was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| if we can say no, why can't we say yes, but lesser? This puts it in council's shoulder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| not the CBID, to actually enact it, as I read it. CBID comes to council and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=844)|
| 0:14:13| here's our recommendation after all our vetting, and we can say yes or no, and I'm saying we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| say yes or no, or yes, but not as long as you said. And I guess I was addressing that last little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=857)|
| 0:14:24| piece, yes, not as long as what you said. We put so much work into trying to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| keep it as limited as we possibly can to make the deal work when we look at our but-for test,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| that I was just, I think it would be tough for council to do that on the fly at a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| council meeting without knowing how it affects the entire deal or the lending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| That's fine. The answer to that would be, if you don't like it, vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Mr. DellaVolpe, would your amendment give the CBID the power to do less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=889)|
| 0:14:58| I didn't set out to tell them that would make some sense, but they seem to have the power to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| either turn the switch on or off and recommend it to us, and I was saying, couldn't we have a slide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| switch instead of an on-off? But it certainly would be a logical thing to suggest that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=907)|
| 0:15:14| have the ability to do it as part of their due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| Well, I mean, I think you bring up a good point. I just think it's a little bizarre. If we approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=918)|
| 0:15:22| a 10-year TIF, why wouldn't, you know, we also, if the CBID recommended a 10-year abatement of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| their revenues, why we wouldn't agree to that as well? Sort of my time to get around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=929)|
| 0:15:36| And I guess that's what I'm saying. If we've done our due diligence and CBID has done their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| due diligence and we're making the recommendation, I think it puts you in a very difficult position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| as city council members to sit up here and second-guess that, unless you have a 10C over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| there that you're going to do the calculations on quickly. It'd be tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=948)|
| 0:15:51| Well, what do you say in response to Mr. Marshall Steyer's comment that the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| right now doesn't seem to have that authority either when they're doing their due diligence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| They can't say give them the first 10 years but hold off after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| We do work with the CBID, though. We will be working with the CBID when we go through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| process. That's correct, Donna Michelle, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=974)|
| 0:16:14| I mean, they're not going to make a recommendation that we haven't reviewed with them extensively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=974)|
| 0:16:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Well, it seems to me that the CBID is in a really strong position to have worked very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=982)|
| 0:16:29| carefully to see that this is going to work or not. And I think if council later on said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| well, you know, we've had a second thought or a third thought about this, so we want to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=993)|
| 0:16:37| this, that isn't setting a very good example or business climate to help grow the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| And I think we all can agree that we do need businesses to help the city grow its revenue base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| and to provide the level of services we expect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, Madam Mayor. And I appreciate your, I understand where you're coming from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| Councilman Della Vopi. And the only problem, one of the problems that I have with it is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1023)|
| 0:17:08| I think that, I don't think there's a lending institute out there that that's a loophole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| that's as big as this room. And when they come for these, you know, for the TIFs and the pilots and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1032)|
| 0:17:19| all this extras, it's always based on, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| It's a financing incentive and sweetener to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| That's correct. So I think they would have a real hard problem with their lending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| institutions. So, I mean, I appreciate where you're coming from, what you're bringing forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| but I can't support that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| Okay, thank you. Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| Thank you, Mayor. And I appreciate the discussion and that was one of the reasons that I second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Mr. Della Vopi's request so that we could have this discussion, which I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| from our colleagues. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| Thank you. Okay, so what we will do is we have an amendment, so we'll vote first on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1073)|
| 0:18:00| Does everybody know what we're voting on here for this amendment? Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1086)|

| 0:18:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| So there was one aye, is that correct? Okay, so the amendment fails eight to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| Okay, and so now we're back to the original motion, which is to approve the, we do have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1097)|
| 0:18:27| to approve, correct? Yes. Are you ready to vote? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1107)|

| 0:18:32| Any opposed? Or did you vote in favor this time or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1117)|
| 0:18:37| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1117)|

| 0:24:11| Now before we move on to this hearing or this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| I would like to recognize we have a Boy Scout troop that's here and if you all would stand up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1455)|
| 0:24:19| and if perhaps somebody could come into the podium and introduce yourselves, who you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| where you're from, who'd like to be the spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1465)|
| 0:24:30| Or a couple of you can come up if that's easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1470)|
| 0:24:46| Hello, just tell us your name and your troop and a little bit about what you're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1486)|
| 0:24:52| Can you speak into the microphone a little closer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1492)|
| 0:24:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| I am Justin Pearson from Troop 556.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| I'm Addison Gross from Troop 556.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| And so tell us why you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| Well, we were going to listen in to your guys' meeting and finish up one of our merit badges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| citizenship in the community and some nation, but yeah, that's pretty much why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1511)|
| 0:25:18| Well, great. Well, thank you so much. We appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1518)|
| 0:25:25| And that's not easy to do when you're called out of the blue to come up and speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| so they did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| Okay, so now this is an appeal and we'll read into the record in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| but let's go ahead and do that, then I'll say the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| 10A is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville approving an appeal by neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| property owners and residents of the Metropolitan Planning Commission's decision to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| Branch Tower's request for a use on review for a 150-foot monopole telecommunications tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1549)|
| 0:25:56| in an R1 district subject to eight conditions, property located on the northwest side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1556)|
| 0:26:01| Ridgecrest Drive, east side of Hollyhock Lane, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1561)|
| 0:26:06| Okay, so Council and for the public who are there, this being an appeals process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| our procedure is we start first and we hear from the appellants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| those who have brought this appeal to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| They will be given up to three speakers, up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| to lay out their case for this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| That will be followed by the respondents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| Again, up to three people, up to five minutes each can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| And then the appellants, by our rules, then are given the opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| And so that's how we will proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| Okay, so we'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1605)|
| 0:26:47| For the appellants, I have Mr. John King, Kelly Ellenberg, and Suzanne Matheny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1607)|
| 0:26:56| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| Thank you, Mayor, Members of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| Because I do not discuss something tonight in reference to this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| it may be something of interest to you, but because I don't discuss it or don't cover it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| doesn't mean I don't think it's important or that I prefer not to talk about that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| It's just in view of the time constraints we have to really try to streamline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| I submitted a report from the Center for Municipal Solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| out of Wake Forest, North Carolina, dealing with the subject of this cell tower application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| That entity specializes in regulating towers and wireless facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| According to its published information, it's the largest and most experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| organization of its kind in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| They currently serve about 700 communities in 34 states.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| They've done in the range of something in excess of 4,000 applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| analysis of 4,000 applications over a 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1681)|
| 0:28:06| I'm not going to try to go through that report because I know you all have received it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| Hopefully, all of you have had an opportunity to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| But a couple of points made that really struck me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| To start with, 50% of the wireless communication towers built since the 1996 Telecommunications Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1698)|
| 0:28:26| do not need to exist, according to their analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| 60% of the towers built since that time are much taller than necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1711)|
| 0:28:38| What I'm suggesting is we don't need any more of unnecessary towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| or those that are unnecessarily tall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1724)|
| 0:28:50| The bottom line to this report is that the application before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| contains factually incorrect statements, erroneous assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1736)|
| 0:29:04| and some unsupported conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I'm not going to give examples of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| They're in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1749)|
| 0:29:13| The subject of cell tower locations and the kinds of structures to support them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1753)|
| 0:29:19| are of paramount importance to local communities and thus local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1759)|
| 0:29:26| You might, I think most anybody would say first question, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| The industry has pretty much now acknowledged that over the next several years for each carrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1771)|
| 0:29:41| for their assessed or their stated need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1781)|
| 0:29:47| they now acknowledge that over the next several years for each carrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| they will have to have a facility ultimately serving about every 75 subscribers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| Most of those facilities will be in or adjacent to residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| In a typical suburban community, that number equates to a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| for each carrier about every 400 to 500 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| I say it's obvious that we can't keep going the way we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1813)|
| 0:30:17| and I'm requesting tonight that you not start down that road with this particular matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| The ultimate conclusion that they reach while saying that there wasn't sufficient information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1823)|
| 0:30:28| to reach a whole lot of conclusions, but one that they could and did reach is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| there currently exists in the area of this proposed site at least one probable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1833)|
| 0:30:40| technically viable, less intrusive alternative to what is proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1840)|
| 0:30:45| and that there are probably others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| Now, I've got information on the subject of sales price of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| There's information that's been submitted to you all through MPC record that discusses that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1853)|
| 0:31:04| Those letters include letters from brokers, real estate professionals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1864)|
| 0:31:10| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| And so I'll leave you to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| I want to start something I guess I'll pick back up on at the time we get to our rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1874)|
| 0:31:26| and that has to do with a report I received earlier today from the appraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| on behalf of representatives of the cell tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1896)|
| 0:31:41| I'm sure you all have it, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| I've got a couple of points to make, and then you're probably going to be the end of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| and I'll have to pick it back up later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Hidden Glen Lane, and then there's a discussion of the cell tower and listing of prices for home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1908)|
| 0:31:58| sold and bringing it down to so much, so many dollars per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| I will observe that on that one and the other three examples he uses to support his position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| that the cell tower doesn't make any difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I'll ask that he be given an additional minute to finish his presentation on this one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| On this one point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1943)|
| 0:32:23| Objection from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| There's objection from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Or no objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1949)|
| 0:32:29| Go right ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| One more minute, and then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1952)|
| 0:32:32| Remember, there's time for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| After everybody gives their presentation, then council can ask questions of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| About any topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I, as I said, those examples, every one of them involves sale of properties subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1963)|
| 0:32:53| to the existence of a cell tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| What he is opining is that these don't really show there's a difference in value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| according to him, from those that are further away from it than those that are closer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| I'm going to argue about that in my rebuttal, but that's his premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| What I'm suggesting to you is there's nothing to demonstrate that all of those weren't depressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1991)|
| 0:33:18| prices, whether they were close to the tower or away from the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| The tower was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| So you've got no data or book of material that compares it to a neighborhood where there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| not a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2011)|
| 0:33:32| There's no comparisons of properties in the census tract, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| Some model, if you will, that you can look at and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| yeah, okay, this demonstrates these houses are selling at the same price per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2019)|
| 0:33:45| as these over here in a subdivision somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| What he is saying is, well, sales in the same subdivision subsequent to the cell tower don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2029)|
| 0:33:57| really show him a difference, if you will, in prices by the square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| I'm going to pick up that theme on rebuttal and talk about it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| And next is Kelly Ellenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Kelly Ellenberg, 2206 Ridgecrest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| On behalf of residents from the Martha Berry Ridgecrest neighborhood, we're so appreciative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| of the time and deliberation you've already given our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| My husband and I live almost immediately across the street on Ridgecrest from the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| lot with our two daughters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| We've always appreciated the scenic views on the ridge and the quiet and charming character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2080)|
| 0:34:45| of this mixed-income neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| We also appreciate that it is a blue-collar area inhabited by honest, hardworking homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2088)|
| 0:34:57| As is the case with many young families in the area, my husband and I are trying to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| wealth, and our home is our biggest asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| We both work full-time jobs and are at a point after years of saving where we are finally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| beginning to make headway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| Like many others, we simply cannot afford to lose out on the investment we've worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| so hard to build for ourselves and our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| The residents of Martha Berry Drive would be equally devastated by this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| many of whom are older persons having lived in their homes for 40 years or more and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2127)|
| 0:35:34| having raised their children there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| We've put tremendous time, energy, and resource investment into this effort, and the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| of your community are counting on you to help us protect our interests and livelihoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2143)|
| 0:35:49| As demonstrated in the MPC's own facilities plan for cell tower siting, these large towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2149)|
| 0:35:56| do not belong in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| Mr. Perry has referred to us as NIMBYs, but instead we argue that a more appropriate term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2159)|
| 0:36:05| for us is NEBYs, not in your backyard either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| There are numerous measures in the branch application that indicate lack of fit according| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| to the facility's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| Among the most egregious is the fact that this tower would stand within 500 feet of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| not one, but 15 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| We've provided a map and accompanying list of these references stamped by a licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2185)|
| 0:36:30| engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Other issues with the application include severe obstruction of the viewshed, inconsistency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| of adjacent land use and design, and problems with stormwater runoff coming down the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2198)|
| 0:36:45| If allowed, the proposed infrastructure could very well create a floodplain in the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| below, including my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Additionally, Mr. King has provided our consulting report from the Center for Municipal Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| CMS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| As he has shared, CMS has stated in writing the inaccuracy of several claims in the branch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2220)|
| 0:37:05| application, among which are the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| These are on page three of the report that they provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| Number one, the application claims that there is no technically viable way to provide the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| service other than a 100-foot bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| CMS states that this is technically and factually incorrect and untrue, end quote, and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2240)|
| 0:37:27| explain that there are commonly used alternative ways to provide the coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| They demonstrate several of these in their exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2252)|
| 0:37:36| Number two, the consultant's report and staff update report claim that there are no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2256)|
| 0:37:41| alternative sites within a mile that are used for the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| The consultant's report and staff update report claim that there are no alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| sites within a mile that are usable for providing the needed coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| CMS states that this is not factually correct and, again, addresses alternatives in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2274)|
| 0:38:00| exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Number three, the application materials purport that this use will not significantly injure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| the value of adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| However, the CMS report includes realtor and appraiser statements on pages 16 through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| 19 that attest to the decreased marketability and property values caused by cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2295)|
| 0:38:23| You have one minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2303)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| In summary, I'd like to quote a passage on page eight of the CMS document that well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| articulates the source of our frustration as citizens throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| Regarding the staff's use on review report and the consultant's report, CMS states that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| the entire premise for the report is based on an incorrect assumption, incorrect information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2322)|
| 0:38:49| and a lack of critically needed information, end quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| There's simply no way to justify the suitability of this tower in this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| Thus, we urge the council to protect the value and character of Knoxville's neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2339)|
| 0:39:05| and approve our appeal of the MPC's decision regarding the proposed branch tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2345)|
| 0:39:10| Thank you again for your time and consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2353)|
| 0:39:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2362)|
| 0:39:22| Go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| My name is Suzanne Matheny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| I live at 1710 Ridgecrest Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| I need my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| I'm co-chair of our Neighborhood Watch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| Kelly has given a personal perspective from a young family's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2376)|
| 0:39:45| Like her, we thank you for this opportunity to express our views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| We thank you for listening to us over the last several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| We know this is a momentous case with which you wrestle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| the decision of which will reverberate throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2397)|
| 0:40:01| We certainly understand and appreciate the magnitude of the decision you have to make tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2401)|
| 0:40:07| I trust you have read and heard the core of our objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2407)|
| 0:40:12| And one neighbor, as I mentioned, Kelly, has already given her perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| I'd like to add just another personal face to this whole picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2417)|
| 0:40:21| On the other end of the spectrum, we have residents who have worked hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| been productive citizens and residents of 40, 50 and more years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| have taken care of and invested in their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| They've paid their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| They voted and they supported the overall strengthening of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| I dare say so has our neighbor who wishes to have this tower on her property, has done similarly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| Yet I must ask, to what extent can one person's right be allowed to infringe on the good of the whole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2447)|
| 0:40:57| How do we justify one property owner's financial gain at the expense of others' investments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2457)|
| 0:41:04| How do we allow a commercial enterprise so blatantly out of step with the principles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2464)|
| 0:41:10| and spirit of the facilities plan to operate in a residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2470)|
| 0:41:14| which is classified as sensitive and avoidance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| We have read that Branch Tower would negotiate this tower's height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| to not be increased without an MPC use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2483)|
| 0:41:29| I ask, what kind of concession or assurance is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| This tower already would soar above our 80-foot tree line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2493)|
| 0:41:40| There appears to be a clear implication this tower would be constructed with an eye to the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2500)|
| 0:41:46| possibly increasing the imposing stature at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| Just another assault on our neighborhood and more emotional upheaval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2510)|
| 0:41:57| Imagine looking at a metal tower 100 feet in height and perhaps ultimately as much as 195 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2517)|
| 0:42:05| from your own back door, especially when you're only 200 or 300 feet away from the center line of the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2525)|
| 0:42:15| We have several of those houses in that category, one being 210 feet from their back door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| And why, if electromagnetic emissions are not a concern for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2543)|
| 0:42:29| why must a warning sign about them be posted on the tower property as is on the Haines Sturkey Tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2549)|
| 0:42:38| We're told emissions are no more than a kitchen microwave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| but frankly my microwave is not turned on 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| And when it comes time for us to sell our homes, and that time will come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| how will anyone be interested in purchasing at the true value of the home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| much less live under the shadow of the tower, tree barrier or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2577)|
| 0:43:03| Perception is a reality for most when we're shopping for homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| Again, I thank you for hearing us out. I trust you will include in your calculations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| an attempt to answer these questions we put before you as if you yourself were a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2594)|
| 0:43:20| in our neighborhood or any other Knoxville neighborhood facing this detrimental possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2600)|
| 0:43:27| I urge you on behalf of my neighbors to uphold our appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| to overturn the MPC 8-5 vote of approval. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2611)|
| 0:43:36| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2616)|
| 0:43:43| Now for the respondents, we have Kevin Blewett, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Bo Harris-Sepsom and Mary Miller. You can go whichever order you choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2631)|

| 0:44:00| and up to five minutes each, and I'll give you a reminder at about a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| Yes, sir. Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2644)|
| 0:44:07| My name is Kevin Blewett. My address is 11509 Commonwealth Drive, Louisville, Kentucky, 40299.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2647)|

| 0:44:32| Here we're talking about a significant gap in wireless service that T-Mobile has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| in the northwest of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| This gap is due to insufficient signal strength for T-Mobile's customers to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2681)|
| 0:44:49| adequate indoor voice and data coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| The area of the gap is approximately one and a half square miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| It encompasses approximately 2,100 people and about 10 miles of residential roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2698)|
| 0:45:05| The gap is bordered by Rifle Range Road to the north,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| Finwood Drive to the south, Parkdale Road to the west, and North Broadway to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| Like most of Knoxville, this area is really hilly terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| It's got lots of mature trees that range from 70 to 100 feet in height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| When we looked at this area and looked at this gap in service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| it was determined that the only way to sufficiently mitigate it was to have a new site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| And we designed that site to be above the tree line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| so it can actually sufficiently cover the area, and it was designed at 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| To that end, we worked with Branch Communications to try to locate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| potential structures for co-location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| They brought back two towers, one transmission tower, and a water tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| All of those were analyzed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2759)|
| 0:46:00| None of those would sufficiently cover the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2760)|
| 0:46:04| We then looked for properties to potentially build a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| They came back with 10, the Corrie property, and nine alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| Of the nine alternatives, three would be acceptable from an RF perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| The Grisham Middle School at 195 feet, the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-day Saints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| and some property off of Snowwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| However, those have been ruled out for other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| That left us with the Corrie property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| We've evaluated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2792)|
| 0:46:33| In order for us to adequately cover the area, control our signal strength,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| and maintain the quality for voice data E911 services, we're asking for a 150-foot tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2799)|
| 0:46:49| And I'll refer you to tab 21 of the pamphlet for RF propagation maps to indicate the gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2809)|
| 0:46:56| as well as the coverage from the proposed site and the alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| Also, we received today the report from the Center for Municipal Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2823)|
| 0:47:09| I just wanted to mention the report references potential use of distributed antenna systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2829)|
| 0:47:17| small cell systems, or other low-power, low-height resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2837)|
| 0:47:26| Those solutions would not be effective for this type of coverage gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| Those systems are typically used for capacity offloads in dense use areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2850)|
| 0:47:39| or indoor offloads for large venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| It's not an effective solution for a large coverage gap in service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2863)|
| 0:47:53| And that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2873)|
| 0:47:54| That's it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2876)|
| 0:47:57| Now, Bo Harris-Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Mr. Simpson, please state your name and address for the record, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| My name is Harris Simpson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| I live at 2368 Academy Court in Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| I'm a real estate appraiser, and we do consulting and special studies also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| I'm an MAI member of the Appraisal Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2896)|
| 0:48:18| I've been in the appraisal and consulting business for over 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| I've worked primarily in the sales and marketing industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Including South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama, and Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| I was asked to perform a special study to determine if this proposed monopole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| would impact surrounding properties, either in terms of their value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| appreciation rates, or marketability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| I published my report on June 1st, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| You have a copy of it under tab 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2925)|
| 0:48:49| Based on my research and analysis of similar situations of existing structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| in the Knoxville and Tennessee area, it's my professional opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| that this proposed monopole will not have a negative influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| on surrounding property values, their appreciation rates, or marketability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| I visited this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| I walked the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| I visited the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| Drove through the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| I also looked at a lot of existing towers in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| Ideally, you look for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| You know, historically, these towers have been in commercial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| but they're starting to become more and more common in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| And what I look for when I'm trying to prove this is I look for existing towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| that are near single-family subdivisions because you see more data there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| There's more home sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2973)|
| 0:49:35| Ideally, the perfect example would be a subdivision that was halfway sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| and then a tower was built, and then the other half of the subdivision sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| and you would have before and after data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I didn't find that in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| Another example we look for is a subdivision where the tower is close to one end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| subdivision but not to the other end, and so you can compare the homes that are close to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| that have a visual of the tower and compare them to homes that are not close to the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=2997)|
| 0:50:02| Hopefully, it's a new subdivision, so you have a lot of uniformity between these homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| They're all new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3007)|
| 0:50:08| They're all new sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| We found several of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| I try to stick with data that's local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3013)|
| 0:50:15| It doesn't really work so well to bring you data that's from other parts of the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| We also interview realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3021)|
| 0:50:23| We interview people in the real estate business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| The data we collected here was very adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| It was compelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| I can add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| I didn't do that in this report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| I did use one example that's in Wilson County, Tennessee, which I thought was useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| Also, I went back out to one of the samples, Exhibit C, in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3043)|
| 0:50:49| I went back out there, actually, today, and this was an example where they had three 260-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3049)|
| 0:50:56| radio towers, which are more intrusive than what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| We're talking about a 150-foot monopole, so three 260-foot towers next to a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3062)|
| 0:51:11| relatively new subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| The towers were taken down two months ago, and the gentleman that lived closest to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| had not noticed that they weren't there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3078)|
| 0:51:22| I talked to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| It's useful to interview people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| It's useful to ask them, what influence have these structures had on your life or on your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| property or on your neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| In his example, he said he grew up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| He lived there his whole life, and they had no impact on his home that he was currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| living in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| He'd been there for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I also interviewed the owner of Saddlebrook Properties, who's developed about 2,800 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3103)|
| 0:51:50| in his career, and he couldn't provide me with an example either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| I think he did provide me with one example of a home buyer who made a comment about a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| cell tower that was visible from a home, and he sold that home to somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| And so there was no end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3126)|
| 0:52:07| And so there was no data there that would support the idea that it hurt the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| So I'm not saying that everybody likes them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| I'm just saying that it doesn't hurt the value, at least in my experience, and particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| I don't think it's going to hurt anybody's property values or their appreciation rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| or the marketability of their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3150)|
| 0:52:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3151)|
| 0:52:31| Now, Mary Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| I'm Mary Miller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| I'm here on behalf of Branch Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| We've submitted a notebook and plans and a certified copy of the ordinance to Mr. Johnson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3163)|
| 0:52:49| in support of our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3169)|
| 0:52:50| Most of that information was at City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| I mean, that planning commission had already been submitted to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3177)|
| 0:52:58| Planning Commission had already been submitted to the Planning Commission and were summaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3178)|
| 0:53:04| I put this picture in the front of the notebook, and we asked him to do it to say, if this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3184)|
| 0:53:10| is not a good site for a residential neighborhood, what site is a good site for a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Large, buffered, and heavily wooded, 5.75 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| We've also offered, and would again reiterate our offer, and would like to submit a monopine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| stealth application to be used here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| If a monopine doesn't work as a stealth application under the facilities plan in this site, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| not really sure where it would under the facilities plan and where a stealth application would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3214)|
| 0:53:38| work in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| I would also like to point out to the Council that in the evidence we've submitted, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3221)|
| 0:53:47| looked at four other towers or co-location opportunities, two towers, power line tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3227)|
| 0:53:55| and a water tank, and ten other raw land sites, nine of which we've addressed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| notebook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| One, which is a 10-acre parcel on Parkdale Road that Mr. King brought up to me yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| does not meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| None of those sites work for either setback reasons or RF reasons except the site at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3247)|
| 0:54:14| McGresham Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| If that site were to go, it would have to be 195 feet tall, and we've discovered looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| at the impact, it would have significant more impact, would impact at least 200 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| We would like to address the report from the Center for Municipal Solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| We are concerned about their credibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| They said they've never been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3276)|
| 0:54:39| What I would note here is there's nothing in this package that says, gives any credentials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| or says who reviewed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| There's nothing that shows credentials for an RF engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| There's nothing that shows credentials for a real estate appraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| There's nothing that shows credentials for a zoning expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| Nothing to substantiate what they've said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| In recent cases, they've been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| In one case, T-Bubble Northeast LLC versus the Incorporated Village of East Hills and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| the Zoning Board of Appeals of the Incorporated Village of East Hills, they found that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| expert that they submitted wasn't a licensed engineer, architect, planner, appraiser, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3311)|
| 0:55:16| he wasn't qualified as a radio frequency engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Secondly, nowhere do they address this site specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| They say, oh, they can manipulate maps, and they show manipulated maps from San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| They show a site in Foxborough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| They show flush mounts on a site with trees, but in the picture of the flush mounts, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3330)|
| 0:55:35| no trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| The real estate opinions refer to properties in Florida, Palo Alto, Walnut Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| So they do not specifically address this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| They have been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| They say they haven't been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| They've been challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I can, three cases I found today, Metro PCS New York, LLC versus the City of Mount Vernon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3351)|
| 0:55:57| Planning Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| A co-location, $16,000 in fees they charged for the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| They were required to disgorge part of those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| The city had to pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| They tried to do the very same thing they're suggesting in this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Look at a DAS system, a D-A-S, or small cell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| The court said, no, you cannot require them to go to a DAS system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| They said, the second thing that they've all said in here is, oh, you could look at a DAS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3378)|
| 0:56:26| or a small cell system, and that would work in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3386)|
| 0:56:29| First, we've had testimony that it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| But secondly, there's several cases out of the Second Circuit, Third Circuit, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| courts of appeals cases that say you cannot require a carrier to go to a small cell or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| DAS system, D-A-S system, to fill their gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3403)|
| 0:56:51| Finally, they talk in their application about the coverage and the need to fill gaps is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| no longer an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| That's exactly what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| We have a coverage gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3419)|
| 0:57:00| There is an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3420)|
| 0:57:01| That is what the testimony has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| I think that is just more evidence that they threw out a lot of generalized information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3423)|
| 0:57:10| but they did not specifically look at this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| We would reiterate, this is a good site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| We've looked at 14 different alternative sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3435)|
| 0:57:20| They don't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| And we would ask the court, I mean, we would ask the city council to approve this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Okay, counsel, well, now we have the up to two-minute rebuttal from Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3449)|
| 0:57:37| Sounds like we jumped the gun and got to court there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| But I'm not going to respond to that because, again, I lack the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| I want to get back to the issue about the appraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3467)|
| 0:57:53| The appraisers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| To illustrate the point, he acknowledged we don't have any before and after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3477)|
| 0:58:06| but he didn't go to a subdivision where there isn't a tower and get a sales history there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3486)|
| 0:58:12| and get it down to how much per square foot houses are selling for as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3492)|
| 0:58:19| how much per square foot houses in the area where the tower is located are selling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3499)|
| 0:58:25| What he did was start with the hypothesis that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| well, if the houses that are further away from the cell tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| are selling for about the same amount per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| as the houses that are closer to the cell tower sell for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| that means the property is not affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3519)|
| 0:58:43| It doesn't take into account the fact that all of them can be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3523)|
| 0:58:48| those further away and those closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| It is a depressed price to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3530)|
| 0:58:53| Going further along those lines, if you'll look at his report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| and I suggest to you, it took me a while to get into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| but I finally think I came up with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| I've been looking at my calculator again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| I got this report this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| On the first one, Hidden Glen Lane, all running mid-70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| $90 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| If you take out the anomaly, and that is on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| if you take out the, in one instance, the lowest price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| which is an anomaly, and in this one the anomaly is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| it's taken out the highest sales by the square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3571)|
| 0:59:37| and you get ultimately a number of $80.78 per square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| as opposed to what they were showing as $82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| You look at the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3586)|
| 0:59:46| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3586)|
| 0:59:47| Your time is up, and why don't we see if Council has questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| I hope somebody will do the math on it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3594)|
| 0:59:54| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| I'd like to move to suspend the rules here and give Mr. King a couple more minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3596)|
| 1:00:02| but I would also like, I see I've dealt with Mr. Larry Perry on a lot of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| and I know he operates nationwide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3609)|
| 1:00:12| I'd like to have just a brief comment from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3612)|
| 1:00:16| because we just got this municipal solutions today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| and I'd just like to have maybe a couple of minutes for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| if we would provide Mr. King a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| So you want me to time that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3625)|
| 1:00:27| A couple minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3627)|
| 1:00:27| Do you just want them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3627)|
| 1:00:28| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3628)|
| 1:00:29| Okay, so two more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3629)|
| 1:00:31| We do this to try and be fair to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3631)|
| 1:00:33| If the Council approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Is there any objection from Council for Mr. King to be given two more minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| and then also for the other side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| Okay, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| And I'm sorry, but if you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3641)|
| 1:00:44| if you take out the high on the ones that are close to the tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| it's an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| It's higher than it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3650)|
| 1:00:51| It's the highest, obviously, sort of disproportionate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| That's the reason I call it an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| On the other hand, those not close to the tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| you take out the one that is the lowest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3658)|
| 1:01:01| In other words, they've got prices running everywhere from $80 to $100 plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| and this one is $68.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| You take those out and divide them by the remainder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| and what you find out is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| in the first instance in Hidden Valley, you got a $3 swing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| and the result is the houses closest to the tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| sales price is $3 per square foot less than those further away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| You do that through every one of these examples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| and you end up, and I'm familiar with all these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| Wrights Ferry, you do the same thing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| You get a $4 swing per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| In other words, the houses closer to the tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| are selling at $4 per square foot less than those further away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3703)|
| 1:01:50| and I think what I want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3710)|
| 1:01:53| I hate to do it because of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| but because of the time constraint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| I'm going to introduce or pass up my copy of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| and it's got a whole bunch of my handwriting on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| about doing just what I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| and noting what the differences are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3728)|
| 1:02:11| and I would also note that none of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| give the location really perhaps as clearly as it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| but for example, on Hidden Glen Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3739)|
| 1:02:22| that's fairly ready access to I-140 at Westland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3742)|
| 1:02:28| It's, you would hit Fox Road and Emory Church Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3748)|
| 1:02:34| and out on Westland to the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| Factors like that influence these prices significantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| but I think if you just take the numbers like I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| and take a look at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| I believe you can see what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| I'm going to put them in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Now, who did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Mr. Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| Mr. Perry, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| Please state your name and address for the record, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| and I'm setting a timer too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| Two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| First off, Madam Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| let me ask for five minutes rather than the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| because I don't represent either side of the party here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| I don't have a single dog in this hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| My name is Larry Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| I live at 11464 Saiga Lane here in Knoxville out in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| Okay, well, you have two minutes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3801)|
| 1:03:23| I'm a representative of the Planning Commission here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| and I've asked to be here to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| any members of the council may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| First, let me, and I haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| I was not given a copy of the CMS report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| so I can't comment on it except what the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Mr. King has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| So let me address a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| Number one, when we looked at the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| me, the staff at the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| every single part of the ordinance was met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| When they first came to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| when the applicants first filed and talked to us about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| it was going to be a 190-foot tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| We got it down to a 150-foot monopole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| which is like a telephone pole, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| Which, again, is getting fairly common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3847)|
| 1:04:11| In the early days of cellular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| and I've been in this business for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| ever since I helped write the rules back in 1973| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| on the FCC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| and I've been in this thing for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| And the reason that the towers were tall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| and are getting shorter is because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| number one, they had a larger coverage area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| in a fast, in a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| Now, as the technology's changing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| then the area's getting smaller and smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| and requires smaller towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| And that's why they're coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Now, with regard to the DAS that he was talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| distributive antenna systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| they're now looking at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| around the University of Tennessee area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| It's one before the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| at the present time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| And we're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| but it doesn't work in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| where they're talking about out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3891)|
| 1:04:53| because the range is only two to 300 yards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3893)|
| 1:04:56| maybe a couple of football fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| So it won't work out here yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| It'll be a long time before it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| But the thing that you have to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| most of the authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| as far as the Planning Commission is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| has been preempted by the federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| And your city attorney can attest to that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| There's not much that the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| or the county, as far as that goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3923)|
| 1:05:24| can do as far as these sites are concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3924)|
| 1:05:27| If they meet all the requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3927)|
| 1:05:29| then there's no further way that they can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3933)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you, Mr. Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| So now I'm going to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| that our formal presentations are completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| And then now Council can, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| ask any questions they might have of anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| And I don't have to set the timer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| for those responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| So, Councilman Dela Lope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| Yeah, I'd like to make a few statements first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| before we call on any people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| And that is that, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| I'd like to make a few statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| before we call on any people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Would the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3959)|
| 1:05:59| from that Martha Berry Ridgecrest area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3969)|
| 1:06:11| I have been contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| and I'm assuming that other Council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| have been contacted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| by a number of neighborhood people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| who are deeply distraught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3979)|
| 1:06:20| by this proposed tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| I'm surprised, first, at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| its facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3987)|
| 1:06:29| that's been in place since 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| and you can argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| whether times are changing or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3992)|
| 1:06:35| clearly said that they should not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| these towers should not be put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3997)|
| 1:06:39| in residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=3999)|
| 1:06:45| And yet that's totally ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4005)|
| 1:06:47| And in fact, we know from these folks' map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| and the information we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| from the engineer that certified it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| that there are 15 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| within 500 feet of this tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| I mean, that to me is an assault| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| on a neighborhood and a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| and I think it's awful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| that that criteria didn't seem to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| Now, Mr. Perry says in his report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| well, that's just a starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| That's not the end of the game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4029)|
| 1:07:11| The reality is it's something important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| It's been part of our community's planning laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| and deciding where you put cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| It's ignored here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| You're also not supposed to put them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| in sensitive areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| and they described in the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| before the MPC that this was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| in fact, a sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4047)|
| 1:07:29| Okay, well, maybe you can get beyond those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| and find other reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| why this thing should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| The reality is it seems like the look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| for alternatives was an afterthought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| The Branch Towers folks had a public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| at the Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| and they said, anybody have any suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| on different sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4068)|
| 1:07:49| And people named about seven of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| and then they come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4071)|
| 1:07:52| with a little two-page chart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| that you saw in the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| if you read them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4075)|
| 1:07:56| that says why each of them is inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| Well, the reality is they admit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| that three of them are adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4080)|
| 1:08:02| The Gresham School site, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| the tower would be taller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4084)|
| 1:08:05| They think it's a worse solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| They're worried about kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| They don't mention in that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| that the Faith Promise Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| up in that same area on Sturgy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| nearby Sturgy Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| has a, I think it's a 180-foot tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| I'm not sure of exact height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4100)|
| 1:08:23| right behind the parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4103)|
| 1:08:24| and there are families and children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| that use that facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| and it seems to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4107)|
| 1:08:29| Why can't they co-locate on that tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| No one mentions it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| Why can't they treat either the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| or the water tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| or some other location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4117)|
| 1:08:38| that they say is too sensitive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| And the answer is they don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4120)|
| 1:08:43| to take the additional risk on themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4123)|
| 1:08:46| as to whether they properly fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| protect, landscape these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| The case law is clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4132)|
| 1:08:54| and you can look at a case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| I think it's Metro PCS versus San Francisco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4135)|
| 1:08:59| out of the Ninth Circuit decided in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| That court said it's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| that Congress had two objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| One, to promote this expansion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| of cellular tower and cellular service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4149)|
| 1:09:11| because that was a growing need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4151)|
| 1:09:13| under the 1996 Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4155)|
| 1:09:16| of the Telecommunications Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| But two, to preserve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| to preserve the power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| of local communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| to deal with the siting and location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4164)|
| 1:09:27| and maintenance of these towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| and that that right was preserved intact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| and the communities can make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4171)|
| 1:09:34| reasonable discrimination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| or in essence discernment decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4176)|
| 1:09:39| of why you might put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4179)|
| 1:09:40| in a shopping parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| or a parking lot for a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4182)|
| 1:09:43| or a school as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4183)|
| 1:09:45| to in a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| That is legitimate zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| that the Congress of the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| in passing this Act said you can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| Further, MPC's expert, Mr. Perry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| clearly states when asked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| I didn't look at no alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| My job was to go see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4202)|
| 1:10:03| if their numbers worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| and that this was an appropriate site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| for a location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| I didn't evaluate or do their homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| He says that clearly before the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| he says it in his own report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| The reality is there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| or at least may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4216)|
| 1:10:17| alternatives that function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| to do this without hurting neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| without putting these towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| where they don't belong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4225)|
| 1:10:26| They belong near interstates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| They belong on commercial property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| and commercial highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| They belong in industrial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Okay, will some of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4233)|
| 1:10:34| be in near residential areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| Sure, but that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| the preferred location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4237)|
| 1:10:38| That's the sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| That's the prohibited area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4240)|
| 1:10:41| kind of thing that our zoning plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4241)|
| 1:10:46| talks about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| So I'd like to hear from someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| I suppose, specifically about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| some of these other sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| And I don't know if that young lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| that spoke, what's her name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| Suzanne, Suzanne, yes, you with the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| Did you not look at some alternative sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| Kelly Ellenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| Well, there's Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4271)|
| 1:11:11| and there's also Suzanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Bethany, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| A couple members of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| drove several of you around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| on driving tours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| of some possible alternative sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4282)|
| 1:11:25| I mean, first, we would like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| I think, make the case that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| of course, it's not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| our responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| to be determining alternative sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| but we did want to give an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| of the fact that these sites are available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| And also, according to the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| other kinds of structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| are also an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| But we did identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| some possible alternative sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| in addition to the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| that were addressed by branch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| Branch has not brought forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| any alternative sites themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| beyond the ones that they had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| early on in the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| that they had looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| according to their information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4332)|
| 1:12:13| If you look at the Metro PCS case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| versus San Francisco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4336)|
| 1:12:17| the Ninth Circuit said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| it is also clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| that Congress did not intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| the cost to the utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| or the tower company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| to be the determining factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Local zoning could go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| on what is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| and compatible in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| And that's a decision committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| to the local zoning folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| whether they be planners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4358)|
| 1:12:39| or city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Now, it is true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| that they cannot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| unreasonably discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4363)|
| 1:12:44| If you say, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| I like Verizon and AT&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| but I'm going to wipe out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| T-Mobile or somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4370)|
| 1:12:52| you cannot treat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| the carriers differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| But if the circumstances are different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| you can treat them differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| That is reasonable discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| That is a power reserved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4382)|
| 1:13:05| to the state and local bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| And I submit that this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| is looking not only at this example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| but what is coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| And OK, maybe in five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| technology will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| but we have to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| the communities that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| And as long as we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| in a lawful manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| I think that that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| I think we have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| Now, will these people raise reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| why their site is preferable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4413)|
| 1:13:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4415)|
| 1:13:36| Is this site get more households| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| than someone other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4419)|
| 1:13:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| But I don't think they're entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| to claim perfection of a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4422)|
| 1:13:45| They have to consider compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4425)|
| 1:13:48| of the resource they are trying to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| in a residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| And it seems to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4432)|
| 1:13:52| that they've short sifted that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| You can say that the 80 foot trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| provide some protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| That's probably true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| But you can see these towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| and they're going to affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| I think they're going to affect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4443)|
| 1:14:04| if not the value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| although we heard Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| say that there is some evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4449)|
| 1:14:10| that you take a couple of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| per square foot off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| you're talking about $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4453)|
| 1:14:15| on a house, $20,000, some percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| And that's what his appraiser said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| that they have in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| I think Branch has come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| and tried to have some public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| to share information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| But the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| And it's not just about personal views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I think that the idea of staying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| out of avoidance and sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| deserves more attention by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| since it's clearly waived out front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| as the decision making tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| that we use in our planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4487)|
| 1:14:50| That's all I have for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4490)|
| 1:14:51| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4497)|
| 1:14:57| Ms. Ellenberg, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| You say that your group has identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| eight or 10 other sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| where a tower could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Did you have an engineer do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| How did you go about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| determining those sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4515)|
| 1:15:17| Well, of course, we don't have the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4517)|
| 1:15:19| to hire an engineer to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| and evaluate these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| But we did look for land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| that would accommodate a tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4523)|
| 1:15:26| which actually is beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| what the call is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| which is to accommodate a co-location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| which doesn't necessarily mean a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4535)|
| 1:15:37| It could mean an antenna on top of a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| But no, we didn't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4541)|
| 1:15:42| and we don't feel that that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| I just am concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| alternatives have been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| This is a very technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| and a very intricate thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| to determine where cell towers need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4556)|
| 1:15:59| You can't just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| well, I like that piece of land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| and there's nobody around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Let's put one there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| It doesn't work that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| There has to be a lot of technology involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| and a lot of evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| And while I respect the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4570)|
| 1:16:12| for trying to find other sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4572)|
| 1:16:15| I really do think that we need to focus on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4575)|
| 1:16:19| what people who do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| with the expertise have recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| or not recommended, as the case may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| And I do want to make a point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| that I had an email from a lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| and she was real concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4592)|
| 1:16:33| about the cell tower going into this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| She did not live in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| but she was concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| And so she did not think that cell towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| should be in areas close to residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| So I emailed her back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4606)|
| 1:16:47| and I said, well, on Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| just south of Walker Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| there's a brand new cell tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| that is several hundred feet tall on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| and there are residences all around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4617)|
| 1:17:00| And this came about after she said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4620)|
| 1:17:04| that the person who owns this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| was going to make a lot of money from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| And I said, well, she can lease it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| or she can sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| And if she sells it to a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4632)|
| 1:17:13| there'll be lots of houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| But anyway, the lady came back to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| and she said that her husband| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| had sold that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| where the cell towers were located on Middlebrook Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4641)|
| 1:17:25| and that it was okay for houses to be around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| And so I emailed her back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| and I said, how is it okay there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| but it's not okay on Martha Berry or Ridgecrest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| And I'm still waiting for her response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| and it's been a week or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| So my point is that putting a cell tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| near a residence is always going to be a ticklish thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| But I do think that we really need to look carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| at a number of issues and some legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| Larry Perry was on the group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| who made the initial writings for this in 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| I think he probably nationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| and even internationally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| has one of the finest reputations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| And I don't think to sully him by a member of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| is an appropriate thing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| How is he sullied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| The comments you made were rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| So I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| He said he did not look at any alternative sites, none, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4700)|
| 1:18:25| Let's stay calm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| Councilman Palmer has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4708)|
| 1:18:29| So I really am concerned about having sites recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4709)|
| 1:18:35| that have not been studied by an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4715)|
| 1:18:38| I have a lot of concerns about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| including the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| I also had an email from the person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| who lives across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4724)|
| 1:18:45| from the road that will come out of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4725)|
| 1:18:47| He didn't seem to have a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4727)|
| 1:18:49| So I think we just need to kind of get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| several things on the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4731)|
| 1:18:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| Yeah, obviously this is a heartburn issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| And we've been out to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4743)|
| 1:19:05| I think some of the sites that we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| that were presented not formally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| but very informally as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| alternative sites were more public spaces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| and more spaces that don't have close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| to a number of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4759)|
| 1:19:21| And, you know, certainly they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| I looked at the tower on Hayden Sturkey Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4765)|
| 1:19:30| at Faith Promise Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| It's totally, you know, there's no houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4771)|
| 1:19:33| within sight of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4773)|
| 1:19:34| You stand on that site, there's no houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| that didn't affect any residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4777)|
| 1:19:41| neighborhood at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| You know, there's a, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| and having, you know, I've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| I've made a career out of residential real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4789)|
| 1:19:52| And I've studied property values going and coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4792)|
| 1:19:55| I think there's certainly enough evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| that a cell tower within 500 feet of 15 homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| there's common sense and an all probability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4801)|
| 1:20:04| would say that there's enough reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| that it would affect the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4806)|
| 1:20:07| Of course it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| I mean, if you're standing, it affects the value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4808)|
| 1:20:11| of the homes that are above the tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| looking down on the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| People that are below the tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| looking the other way, it won't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4817)|
| 1:20:19| surely it wouldn't affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4819)|
| 1:20:20| They wouldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| But for the homes in a small number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| but yet homes of big, of good value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| homes, a longstanding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| It's not a new neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| It's not a new area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| This is a longstanding established neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| that just about every lot up through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| is built on and maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| The Dogwood Trail runs through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| So obviously we see great value in the homes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4841)|
| 1:20:44| and in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4844)|
| 1:20:45| I think that it, so there is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| there certainly could be a case built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| by a residential appraiser that could come to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| that there probably is reason to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| that it would affect the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| I think it's not in keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4859)|
| 1:21:00| with the residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4860)|
| 1:21:04| I've pressed pretty hard to find it a new tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4864)|
| 1:21:08| that's been built in the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| where it's been built in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4870)|
| 1:21:11| of a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4871)|
| 1:21:13| I haven't seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| Haven't seen a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| And there's a reason for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4876)|
| 1:21:17| And I think this is a commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| it's a commercial use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| and you're putting it in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| of a residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Whether it's needed or not is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| you know, that's really another argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| But from the standpoint of a residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| and protecting the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| of a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4898)|
| 1:21:39| I think you could make certainly enough arguments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4899)|
| 1:21:41| to believe that there's enough clouds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| and there's enough information surrounding it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| that it would affect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| And that is one of the criteria that's laid out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4909)|
| 1:21:51| that it won't affect it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| And so for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| I move that we approve this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4914)|
| 1:21:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| We have a motion and a second to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Let's have more discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Councilman, can we just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| let me hear from Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| All my concerns have been discussed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| There's one thing I wanted to point out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| I looked at just a simple search on T-Mobile's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| If you type in an address and look at their coverage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| they have 4G LTE service blanketing this whole area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| So I'm not a technical expert on cell service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| but it seems like unless they're being misleading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| on their website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4949)|
| 1:22:30| they do cover this whole area pretty thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| So it's, you know, it's a valid point to bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| Hear from the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| Let me hear from the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4960)|
| 1:22:40| We'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| Okay. Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| And I appreciate what my colleagues have had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| This has been a heartburn, George,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| in terms of not only all the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4969)|
| 1:22:52| and a lot of the information that we just received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| in the last couple of days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| I too have been out to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| and I've looked at different areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| that they've talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| in terms of the possibility of a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| But I do have a couple of questions I'd like to ask MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| I mean, MPC has gone through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| and I'm sure all of you have read all the minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| and the length of time they went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| and the workshops and this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4991)|
| 1:23:12| And I kind of feel like we're the last jury up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4992)|
| 1:23:16| to make a decision based on information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4996)|
| 1:23:19| that maybe we've only had for 24 or 48 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=4999)|
| 1:23:22| And I feel a little concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| But I do want to ask MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| would you give us a definition of sensitive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| and the facilities plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Tell us what that really means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| And also, what George was referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| and what I was trying to read also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| the situation about the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| that are less than 500 feet away from the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5023)|
| 1:23:47| If you could address that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| Again, I'm Larry Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| I'm with the Planning Commission staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| Mr. Greave, the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| let me give you a little bit of brief history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| on this facility plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| That was made by myself and Alvin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| and a few other guys on the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| put this together back in 2002| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| when we didn't have smartphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| We didn't have data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5049)|
| 1:24:10| We didn't have 3G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5050)|
| 1:24:11| We didn't even have 2G back in those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5051)|
| 1:24:14| All we had was talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| And we built that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| so we wouldn't be building these big, tall towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| in different sensitive areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Sensitive area is an area that you need to be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| as far as potential other areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5064)|
| 1:24:28| to look at for taller towers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5068)|
| 1:24:31| And we also, if you look at the facilities plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5071)|
| 1:24:33| we listed about the height of the towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| depending on where the sensitive areas were located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5075)|
| 1:24:38| A shorter tower was in more populated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| The taller towers were more over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5082)|
| 1:24:43| into the residential areas to discourage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| And that's what we were trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5088)|
| 1:24:49| to discourage those in those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Now, everything has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5091)|
| 1:24:52| Technology has changed almost 20-fold| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5092)|
| 1:24:55| in the last 15 years since we wrote this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5095)|
| 1:24:57| Actually, since the last 13 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5097)|
| 1:24:58| since we wrote this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| As a matter of fact, the staff right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| is looking at the facility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| as being way out of date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5104)|
| 1:25:05| and possibly going to either do away with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| or change it around quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5107)|
| 1:25:09| Now, the other thing that you'd ask about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5109)|
| 1:25:10| what was the other question you asked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| But wait, again, explain to me again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5112)|
| 1:25:15| how you determined a sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| Sensitive area was, well, you have three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5117)|
| 1:25:19| You have sensitive, you have opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| and you have neutral areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| All right, sensitive areas are areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5124)|
| 1:25:25| that are the last place you want to look, okay, for a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Not to say it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5130)|
| 1:25:33| There's nothing in the facility plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| that says do not build a tower here, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| There's nothing there that says that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| The facility plan is only an advisory document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| to the planning commissioners themselves, all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| And that was the whole master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| I would say, okay, when you come up with an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| that wants a tower somewhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5150)|
| 1:25:51| these are the areas I would rather see it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5151)|
| 1:25:53| For example, on ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5153)|
| 1:25:54| We don't want to see them on ridgetops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| We don't want to see them within 1,500 feet of each other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| because it becomes a porcupine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| That's what we're trying to stop in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5159)|
| 1:26:01| We don't want another watt road out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| where you've got three towers within 60 feet of each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| That's what we're trying to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| Right now, ladies and gentlemen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5167)|
| 1:26:09| you've got 13 national carriers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5169)|
| 1:26:12| We've got five in this area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| The rest of them haven't come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| They're fixing to release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| FCC's fixing to release another set of block of frequencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| coming up in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5179)|
| 1:26:21| And where are these people going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| I mean, you're just now beginning to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| as I explained to the group out at the Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| if you take the whole United States today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| and you put a crosshatch pattern across the whole country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| each crosshatch is one mile corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| If you have one tower on each one of those corners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| it's not going to be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| And that includes residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| Now, the height of the towers are coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| That's what we're trying to encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| And that's what the facilities plan is encouraging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Sensitive areas, areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| the last place you want to look at for a tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| Okay, but what I still don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| is how and who determined sensitive areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5215)|
| 1:26:59| and how did this facilities plan come about 13 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| The facilities plan was at the suggestion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| of the planning commissioners at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5225)|
| 1:27:08| myself, as a gentleman who's now out in Seattle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Alvin, I can't remember his last name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| and two other guys looked at all the possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| of all around the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5237)|
| 1:27:18| because I worked with counties all over the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| and we said, okay, these are the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| where the least areas we want to have towers in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5241)|
| 1:27:26| Okay, and that sets the sensitivity of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| Neutral areas like industrial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5249)|
| 1:27:32| commercial zones on top of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| those are neutral areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5254)|
| 1:27:35| Opportunity areas are in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| where it's a wide open field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| there's no homes close to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| it doesn't require any kind of impact somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| And those are your opportunity areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| But as a practical matter now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5265)|
| 1:27:47| what has happened in the last 10 years, last 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| the technology has changed, the frequencies have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| Now, let me go real short here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| In the early days, we had two carriers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| Verizon and U.S. Sailor, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| They were at a very low frequency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| they cover a lot of territory with a large envelope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| Today, they have doubled the frequency range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| and they're up to 1800 megahertz| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| where these people are located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| T-Mobile, for example, AT&T,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| and as a result of that, the coverage is much, much smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| and therefore they require more towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| and that's what we're running into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| In order to have the service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| that everybody's demanding right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| the data, the television, the internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| everything on your smartphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| you're going to have to have this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| it's just a matter of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5313)|
| 1:28:34| Yeah, and I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| What I'm getting at is we have a facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5316)|
| 1:28:42| that also talks about sensitive areas, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| And that's what we have on the record right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5328)|
| 1:28:48| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5328)|
| 1:28:49| Again, that's an advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5329)|
| 1:28:50| that's only advisory, it's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| But it hasn't changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| It's in the process of being...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Well, that doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5338)|
| 1:28:59| I mean, what we have to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| is what we have on the books, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Okay, and we have that on the books right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| It's on the book for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| And what we're looking at is the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| of a tower being in a sensitive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| according to the facilities plan that we have on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| And you've got several already up there, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Okay, but I'm trying to figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5357)|
| 1:29:19| what I've got to look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5359)|
| 1:29:20| in terms of how I have to make a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| based on reports that one side says it's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| and one side says it isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5367)|
| 1:29:28| and reports on the other way that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| you know, trying to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| So, but my main issue there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| that we do have on the books a facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5374)|
| 1:29:37| that has a sensitive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5377)|
| 1:29:39| and this is a sensitive area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| How does also then this business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| about 15 homes being less than 500 feet from the tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| how does that tie into either the facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| or the sensitive area plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| So why is it mentioned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| They brought it up, we didn't bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5397)|
| 1:29:58| What we look at, we have to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| what is in the ordinance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| We look at what's in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5403)|
| 1:30:04| The ordinance says that the distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| from the nearest property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5407)|
| 1:30:08| has got to be 110% of the height of the tower or the pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5408)|
| 1:30:12| All right, in this case, it's about 160, 163 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| And that's all the planning commissioners can go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5416)|
| 1:30:19| That's all we as a staff can go on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5419)|
| 1:30:20| is what the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| And this applicant meets what the law requires, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| But where the tower, where you're locating the tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| you say that there should not be a resident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5430)|
| 1:30:33| closer than 110% from the height of the tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| No, I said that's 110% from the nearest property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| And in the county, it's a little different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| The county says it's, I'm not worried about those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| Yeah, I'm not worried about the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| So do we have houses, in your opinion, and on the maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| do we have houses that are closer to the tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| than that rule that you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| If you have houses within 500 feet of the tower, answer yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5457)|
| 1:31:01| Are they within 110% of the height of the tower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| Okay, and the rule has to do with the height of the tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Have you had a chance to read this report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| I have not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| I have not been provided with a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5471)|
| 1:31:13| Okay, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Well, I guess you'll have a chance to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| and of course, we have to make a decision tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5478)|
| 1:31:24| So in your opinion, and according to what we read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| with the MPC staff, the applicant meets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| all the requirements of the ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5492)|
| 1:31:33| On that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| As a practical matter, it's very, very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| for a local planning commission or even a body like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| to go beyond the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| that the local planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| the local jurisdictions have put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| and otherwise, you'd be saying, how high is up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| We don't know how high is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| We've got to go by what the law says, and they meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5513)|
| 1:31:58| So in other words, you followed all the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| of the ordinance that we have, according to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| We meet every one of the requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5521)|
| 1:32:03| Okay, what recourse do they have if this is turned down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5523)|
| 1:32:07| If you turn it down, you've got to give them a written notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5527)|
| 1:32:12| and give them substantial evidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5532)|
| 1:32:13| as to why it was turned down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| The value of the home is not one of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| And what they will do, if I were them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| and if it's turned down, I would file suit tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| in federal court, because every time this comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| and I've been through this thing for the last almost 25 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5549)|
| 1:32:34| the municipalities will lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| We had it over in Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| The people over in Blount County didn't want one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| in a neighborhood over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| They appealed it to the city council in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5561)|
| 1:32:45| They went to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| They lost, cost them $250,000 in fees to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| and that goes against the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5569)|
| 1:32:51| So, I mean, it's up to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| I'm just telling you that as far as the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| is concerned, and as far as the applicant is concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| again, I don't have any dogs in this hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| I'm just telling you what the law is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| I don't represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| I don't represent these guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5583)|
| 1:33:04| I'm just telling you what the law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5584)|
| 1:33:05| and what my experience has been for the last, you know, 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5585)|
| 1:33:09| Can we hear from Tom at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5589)|
| 1:33:12| Mr. Bretschko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5592)|
| 1:33:23| My name is Thomas Bretschko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| I'm with the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| My home away from home is here, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5607)|
| 1:33:30| On the issues of the sensitive area, opportunity areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5610)|
| 1:33:37| the facilities plan has a matrix that was established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| for the purpose of establishing guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| for tower placement and appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| And under that, it states in here that the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| or advisory and adherence to them is not a legal requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| Within that, it has taken three areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| an opportunity area, which are the most likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| to provide good sites for the widest range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| of telecommunication installations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| It goes to sensitive areas that are areas usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| of higher density, within 500 feet of lower density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| residential areas, community facilities, churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5657)|
| 1:34:20| It lists a number of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| And they have avoidance areas that are the least preferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5662)|
| 1:34:27| locations for wireless communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| to the communication towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5669)|
| 1:34:32| And the matrix identifies a number of different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5672)|
| 1:34:38| and avoids examples in the opportunity areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| It lists industrial business parks, industrial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| rural areas, pasture, shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5686)|
| 1:34:51| The sensitive area gets into identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5691)|
| 1:34:55| within 500 feet of a residence, rural residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| non-residential properties such as church, cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| libraries, multifamily residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| and on a hill below a ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| And avoidance lists conservation, open space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5707)|
| 1:35:11| scenic highways, public parks, ridge top, ridgeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5711)|
| 1:35:15| scenic vista, historic district sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5715)|
| 1:35:19| single family residential, and vacant residential lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| The each category identifies in the matrix towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5723)|
| 1:35:28| based on their height or whether they're a stealth tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| And the way it's set up here, it has a co-location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| a stealth structure, low monopole below 90,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5734)|
| 1:35:38| moderate monopole 90 to 150, a tall, starts at 150| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5738)|
| 1:35:44| and goes to 199, then a lattice tower or a guide tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5744)|
| 1:35:49| And each one, when you look at the matrix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| it identifies whether that site is encouraged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| it's a neutral or discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| And when we get a tower location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| it's not just one category it falls into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5760)|
| 1:36:03| In this case, there are actually three areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5763)|
| 1:36:06| that we identified as would be appropriate for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| And one is that the tower site is within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| 500 feet of a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5772)|
| 1:36:15| It's on a hill below a ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5775)|
| 1:36:18| It's on a hill below a ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| Those are both in the sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| On the avoidance, it's a single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| And when we look at this, you'll find that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5789)|
| 1:36:31| if it's within 500 feet of a residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5791)|
| 1:36:35| a moderate monopole up to 150 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| is actually looked at as being neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| The plan is neutral on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| It doesn't discourage, it doesn't encourage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| On the issue of on a hill below a ridgeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| for a moderate monopole, it takes a neutral position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| On the issue of a single family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| it discourages a moderate monopole of 90 to 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| In our report, we identified that two of the categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5826)|
| 1:37:10| and again, this 150 foot tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| is the top range of a moderate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| And somebody may argue that because 150 is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| in both the tall and the moderate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| you know, it's kind of on the line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| as to which one it applies to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| But we identified that the single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| residential neighborhood is actually discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5847)|
| 1:37:32| It doesn't say that it cannot be located there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| Again, it's a guide for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| of that location for a proposed tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| But it is discouraged?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| It's discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5862)|
| 1:37:43| And what we have done in discussions with the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| is that you're looking at a discouraged site for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5868)|
| 1:37:52| You need to look at what other alternatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| and there are other ways to provide your service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| instead of just saying this is our only site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5879)|
| 1:38:02| You know, if we have a site that's an opportunity area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| and encouraged, we would not ask for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5885)|
| 1:38:07| to get into a lot more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| as to whether or not they can find other locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| But the one thing that we've been finding out recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| is that the most recent applications we've gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| have all been in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| They've all actually, the three we had recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| were all through T-Mobile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| who is trying to provide coverage in areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| And they have looked at other sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| And in this case, people can argue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| whether they provided adequate documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| on whether or not there are alternative sites for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| when the issues have been raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| They have responded back as to whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| in some cases, when a tower has been raised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| they're already on that tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| or it may be in a location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| that does not give them the coverage that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| They're coming back saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5934)|
| 1:38:55| that we've looked at all these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| We cannot find another suitable site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| And the other thing that was in our report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| and I know people can say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| well, we're not supposed to have anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| in a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5949)|
| 1:39:12| and we should deny, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| deny because it's in a residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5954)|
| 1:39:16| but we can't ignore the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| that technology has changed considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| since the time the report was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5961)|
| 1:39:23| In 2002, wireless service was basically voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| People had cell, I mean, had landlines at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| You would usually use your cell phone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5972)|
| 1:39:34| when you're out on the road in commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| or places away from home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| There was not a great demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| in residential neighborhoods for that service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| and the plan discouraged locating them there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| to provide coverage that may be along a highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5986)|
| 1:39:50| or some other area to try to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| putting them in these residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| But the fact is a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5996)|
| 1:39:57| are doing away with landlines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| People are using their phones at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| So now there's a greater demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| in these residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| and the plan does not look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| does not address that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| and, again, discourages it being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6010)|
| 1:40:13| And that's what we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| the fact that we need to be looking at this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| to update it, to start looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| some of these other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| I have a cell phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| I have a landline, but when I'm at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6023)|
| 1:40:25| I'm constantly on my cell phone looking up data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| and I think it's those type of changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6029)|
| 1:40:31| that there's more demands and pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6031)|
| 1:40:34| put on trying to provide service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| in residential neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| which we didn't have in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6037)|
| 1:40:40| Well, and this body has asked you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6040)|
| 1:40:42| to look into this, to update that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| But I have a question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| when you said avoidance zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6046)|
| 1:40:50| If I'm either a tower builder or a provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6050)|
| 1:40:54| and I come to you and I have a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| that I want to put a cell tower on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6056)|
| 1:41:00| and it's in an area such as this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6060)|
| 1:41:03| which is an avoidance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| do you work with them to let them know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| what areas are close by that either are opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| or the other that you commented on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| I mean, what's the responsibility of MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6075)|
| 1:41:18| when someone comes in and we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6078)|
| 1:41:20| that this is an avoidance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| according to the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| If any calls come in about cell towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| unfortunately, they're all given to me at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| And I talk a lot with providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6089)|
| 1:41:35| and tower companies that are looking for locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| And we talk about locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| or where they're proposing to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6101)|
| 1:41:43| And when I look at areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| the first thing I point to their attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| is that there's the facilities plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6107)|
| 1:41:49| there's a matrix that identifies areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| that are encouraged or discouraged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6112)|
| 1:41:55| And you need to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6115)|
| 1:41:56| when you're looking at sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| So everybody I talk to is told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| that they need to look at this facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| and the matrix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6123)|
| 1:42:04| Did they come back to you with alternative sites?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| Most of the time we talk with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| well, these are probably the first ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6129)|
| 1:42:12| I've had in a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| where we're starting to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6134)|
| 1:42:15| into residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| We haven't had that as much in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| We had T-Mobile, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| probably about two or three years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| that was on the other side of the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6146)|
| 1:42:28| And they were looking at an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| that was 90-some acres of wooded area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| But it was across the road from Sturkey Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| There was a considerable amount of opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6155)|
| 1:42:37| about it being in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| that they were probably 1,000 feet from a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6159)|
| 1:42:44| Because it's visible, they're going to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| So they actually backed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| and didn't pursue anything in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| But I think we're going to be seeing more of these cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| where there's demand in residential neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| And we're going to have to really look at the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| and how we look at locating them in these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| We talk to them about ways to reduce the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| if they can't find alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| Excuse me, but they all have side impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| If you do close mount on a tower that's 150 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| so all you see mainly is the pole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6199)|
| 1:43:22| you lose the number of co-locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6202)|
| 1:43:24| you can have on that tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| which will probably mean you'll have more requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| for other towers in that area to provide service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| If you provide the larger platforms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6211)|
| 1:43:34| that gives better coverage, more antennas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| then you may only see one tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| We try to do things to reduce the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| of clearing on a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| There's a number of things we tried to discuss with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| but the issue, you know, can they go lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| I know Mr. Perry, when he's reviewed cases in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| where they've come in with, let's say, a 190-foot tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| He said, looking at your data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| I think you can do it with a lower tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| And they've come back and reduced the heights of the tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| if that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Of course, one of the things is when you do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| you may then reduce the number of co-locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6250)|
| 1:44:13| where another provider would be able to get at a height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| that would provide adequate service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6256)|
| 1:44:17| But we try to reduce the impact as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| But as far as an area being an avoidance area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| it really doesn't mean anything, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| According to your plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| I mean, it sounds like that you may have an avoidance area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6266)|
| 1:44:31| and you call it, which this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6271)|
| 1:44:32| but if a company comes in and wants to put a tower there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6272)|
| 1:44:36| Well, again, as I point out that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| they are asked to look in more detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6279)|
| 1:44:41| at are there other locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6281)|
| 1:44:43| that would provide the same amount of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| without being within that avoidance area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| So, yeah, we do ask them to look for alternative sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| Do we go out and try to find them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| We don't have the capabilities of doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| It's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| Well, and one of the things, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| is that just by the ordinance requirement in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6298)|
| 1:45:01| of 110% of the height of the tower from a property line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| it requires a much larger site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| to be able to put that tower on to provide service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| I know when people mention counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| we're not the county, but in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| it's actually 110% from a residential structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| So you can be 50 feet from a property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| So it has a lot different impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| and the city actually has a better ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| as far as requiring bigger sites to provide the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| Councilman Della Veppe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6335)|
| 1:45:36| We were talking about alternative sites before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6336)|
| 1:45:38| and George mentioned one or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6338)|
| 1:45:40| There was a 10-acre parcel for sale on Parkdale Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6340)|
| 1:45:43| right next to a TVA transmission line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6343)|
| 1:45:46| and it's up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6346)|
| 1:45:48| But let me go back to the point I wanted to emphasize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| In 47 U.S. Code Section 332,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| parens C, parens 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| that's the statute we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6359)|
| 1:46:01| Its title is Preservation of Local Zoning Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| And it says, A, general authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| except as provided in this paragraph,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| nothing in this chapter shall limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6371)|
| 1:46:13| or affect the authority of a state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| or a local government or instrumentality thereof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| over decisions regarding the placement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| construction, and modification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| of personal wireless service facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Local power exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| It is not just someone shows you they need a signal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| and they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| That power to regulate zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| and to regulate compatible uses remains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| The limitations are you can't unreasonably discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| You can't pick one over the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| in a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| You can't prohibit totally wireless service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6405)|
| 1:46:49| That's against the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| of the Federal Communication Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| You can't decide it without giving your reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| And finally, and some people talked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| that it is not proper to try to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| about the environmental effects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| of radiation from cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| The government's made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| It's not open for question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6429)|
| 1:47:11| Now, do people maybe make that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6431)|
| 1:47:13| when they decide not to move there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| Probably, but it's not a ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| that a decision-making body can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6437)|
| 1:47:19| One last thought on that whole point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| Here's the Court of Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| from the Ninth Circuit, 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6443)|
| 1:47:25| that we talked about before in San Francisco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| When they said it shall not unreasonably discriminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| against providers of functionally equivalent services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6451)|
| 1:47:35| it says that you can discriminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| if it's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6457)|
| 1:47:38| And here's the words I want to read to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| More specifically, most courts have held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| discrimination based on traditional bases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| of zoning regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| such as preserving the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6467)|
| 1:47:50| and avoiding aesthetic blight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6470)|
| 1:47:52| are reasonable and thus permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| That is a reasonable ground to base a decision on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| and I'm asking my colleagues to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| And it may be that our MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| and we have asked him, as Mr. Greave mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| has to look harder at what we do in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6486)|
| 1:48:08| but right now we have this plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| This goes somewhat against his grain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| I think we have the power to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| avoiding aesthetic blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| When you look at our use on review regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| that I think Mr. Frost sent out to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| things like those proper zoning considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| about putting like things together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| and not having interference things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| that's a legitimate concern of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| in planning its future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6517)|
| 1:48:38| So I think, one, we have the authority to act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6518)|
| 1:48:42| and two, there's a reasonable basis here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| We think there are alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| They admit three of them are alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6526)|
| 1:48:48| They're concerned either about the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| or in one case they say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6530)|
| 1:48:51| well, maybe there's more safety concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| and I don't know whether that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6533)|
| 1:48:54| more fence or more activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6534)|
| 1:48:56| They mentioned that they can co-locate on TVA towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| but the TVA requires their engineers to be present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6539)|
| 1:49:03| This is at the meeting in the Lions Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6543)|
| 1:49:08| and that would be more costly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| but you can understand TVA's position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6550)|
| 1:49:12| that they don't want someone working on their tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6552)|
| 1:49:15| without them knowing if it's compromising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6555)|
| 1:49:18| their electrical system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6558)|
| 1:49:20| But those are concerns that are important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| to the cell provider utility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| as to what it might cost for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| to go after a piece of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| where they say they don't have enough signal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| That's not the concern of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| and the court case says you don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| to make your decision based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6578)|
| 1:49:39| on the most favorable cost to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| You got to do right and not discriminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Thank you, Mayor, again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6584)|
| 1:49:52| I'd like to ask Mr. King, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| this report that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6594)|
| 1:49:56| Excuse me, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6596)|
| 1:49:57| I'd like to ask Mr. King this report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6597)|
| 1:49:59| that we got just a bit ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6599)|
| 1:50:02| From Municipal Solutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| did they actually come and look at the site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| Is this boilerplate, or did they actually come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| No, it is not boilerplate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6613)|
| 1:50:15| They studied the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| all the contents of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6617)|
| 1:50:20| but they did not come and look at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6620)|
| 1:50:24| They were finally engaged by me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6624)|
| 1:50:29| I think, recalling correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| Last Thursday, I wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| no, I'll take that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| It would have been last Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| and had them working over the weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| I asked them to come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6645)|
| 1:50:49| for a dual thing, to appear here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6649)|
| 1:50:51| and also to have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| to see the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6653)|
| 1:50:54| but they were otherwise conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| They had three other meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| similar to this going on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6660)|
| 1:51:03| and into tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| and could not be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| If I may, I've got a couple of points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6667)|
| 1:51:11| I'd like to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| I understand I've got to get asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6673)|
| 1:51:14| a question before I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Would someone like to ask Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| whatever his point is he'd like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| I'll ask Mr. King what his points are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| as long as I can ask the other side also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| Talking about this wireless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| communications facilities plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6688)|
| 1:51:29| I think we've sort of given it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6689)|
| 1:51:31| short shift in at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| some people's perception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6693)|
| 1:51:39| In the document itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| how the plan will be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6701)|
| 1:51:43| you can read this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6703)|
| 1:51:44| it will be adopted as an element| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| of the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| and will be the basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| for other planning proposals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| included in the sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6712)|
| 1:51:54| the City of Knoxville Development Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6714)|
| 1:51:56| the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6716)|
| 1:51:58| and the suggestion that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6718)|
| 1:52:04| it doesn't mean anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6724)|
| 1:52:06| or trying to give that impression| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| I don't think is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| I understand, and I don't disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6731)|
| 1:52:15| that technology has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| or is changing in this subject matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| But prior to 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| people were trying to obtain approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| for cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| That's what brought about this document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| And this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| not these people necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| but this body thought enough of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| at the time that we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| some sort of a policy going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| on how we're going to deal with these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| That's how this plan came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| This qualifies either one or two ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6771)|
| 1:52:54| It's either in a sensitive area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| or an avoidance area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| Now, yes, technology has changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| but they were looking for towers in 2002,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6780)|
| 1:53:05| and today they're looking for tower sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6785)|
| 1:53:09| No other circumstances have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6789)|
| 1:53:12| Technology doesn't have anything to do with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| It's a question about siting of towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| And I think the point is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6797)|
| 1:53:21| that this one doesn't qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6801)|
| 1:53:24| under our own rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| and there's been at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6807)|
| 1:53:30| I think, substantial question raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| as to whether this is an appropriate location or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| and whether you can decline to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6818)|
| 1:53:44| One other thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6824)|
| 1:53:45| and it was only because it was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6825)|
| 1:53:47| Mr. Perry talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| You had to have a written decision on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6829)|
| 1:53:56| I think Mr. Swanson can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| but the use of the word written in that context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6839)|
| 1:54:04| doesn't mean you all have to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6844)|
| 1:54:06| and write out a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6846)|
| 1:54:08| with all the facts that support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| It's a decision made by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| which is, in fact, in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| and if it's based on stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| that is likewise in writing before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6856)|
| 1:54:19| one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6861)|
| 1:54:21| I'm treading on your territory, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| I'll let you explain to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| Now that I've confused things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| will you straighten them out, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6868)|
| 1:54:29| Would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| Well, the courts have generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6872)|
| 1:54:34| and fairly consistently held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| that where you are required to have reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| for your decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| when the court can find the reason for your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6882)|
| 1:54:45| clearly within the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6885)|
| 1:54:47| it's not necessary that you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| some type of written findings of fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6888)|
| 1:54:51| that you all vote on or agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| As long as they can find within the written record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6894)|
| 1:54:57| that is presented when it comes before the court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6897)|
| 1:54:59| that that rationale is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| generally the court will find that that is adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| Vice Mayor Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6909)|
| 1:55:09| Madam Mayor, we've got a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6909)|
| 1:55:11| I think this has been thoroughly vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| I'm going to call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6914)|
| 1:55:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6915)|
| 1:55:17| Is there any objection to calling for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| No, I'm just going to be abstaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| because I work with John King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6923)|
| 1:55:24| and he's working on this claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6924)|
| 1:55:27| Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6927)|
| 1:55:28| Is there an objection to call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Okay, let's hear the objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6931)|
| 1:55:32| Well, I just feel that we ought to allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| the other side to make some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6935)|
| 1:55:37| since we did let Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| just for a few minutes anyway, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6938)|
| 1:55:42| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| Okay, so unless he's going to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| We'll have to vote on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| unless you'd like to retract that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6948)|
| 1:55:53| You know, we've been through this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6953)|
| 1:55:54| and we're getting out of control with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| If we're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6956)|
| 1:55:57| we're going to have to put time limits to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| because each side can keep...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| We could be here till midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| We could be here till 6 a.m. actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| So I'll withdraw my motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| and allow Ms. Miller to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6968)|
| 1:56:14| Well, I mean, we didn't put any time restraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| on Mr. King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6977)|
| 1:56:17| so I don't think it's fair to put two minutes on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| But I will come back with the same call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| I will try to be very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| In regards to the alternative sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6988)|
| 1:56:30| we did look at 10 alternative raw land sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| nine of which were addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| in the tabs under number 21 and number 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| We also looked at the 10-acre site on Parkdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| It will not meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| It's less than 300 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| and so it will not meet the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| We also looked at the tower on Oaklet Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7010)|
| 1:56:55| on Oaklet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| and Haines Sturkey at the Faith Promise Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| We've addressed that in number 21 as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| and 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| It will not meet the RF requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7023)|
| 1:57:06| to fill the coverage gap here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| I would like to just take a short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| to address the facilities plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| First, I would note that within 500 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| of a residence is a neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| But I would also like to point out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| that the facilities plan also says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7039)|
| 1:57:22| in the body of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7042)|
| 1:57:23| that you can meet the terms of the facilities plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| by providing screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7048)|
| 1:57:29| and putting a tower on a hillside below the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7049)|
| 1:57:33| That's what has happened in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7053)|
| 1:57:35| this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| It is well-screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7056)|
| 1:57:37| It's a 5.75-acre parcel totally covered with trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| It's well-screened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7062)|
| 1:57:44| And we have submitted a monopine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| All of those things show that we meet the facilities plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7067)|
| 1:57:51| even though it may not be binding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7071)|
| 1:57:55| We've addressed the issue about coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| under tab 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7078)|
| 1:58:02| And if there's any other questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7082)|
| 1:58:04| but those are the main things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7084)|
| 1:58:05| that I would like to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| I just have a quick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7094)|
| 1:58:14| I was reminded by council's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7094)|
| 1:58:18| about statements in the record, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| You know, the use on review standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7102)|
| 1:58:24| that are in our own ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| have several criteria that one looks at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| in granting a use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| which this falls under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7112)|
| 1:58:34| And at least three or four of those seem to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| One is the use is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| with adopted plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| We heard the talk about the facilities plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7122)|
| 1:58:43| and Mary makes the point that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| we try to do the mitigating factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7126)|
| 1:58:48| Two, the use is in harmony with the general purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| and intent of these zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7130)|
| 1:58:52| i.e. avoid residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| Three, the use is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| with the character of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| We got a scenic dogwood trail neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| with a great vista looking towards the mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| and this is kind of different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| And it's also, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| in with the size and location of the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| in the vicinity, and this is bigger in scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| And four, it says, will not significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| injure the value of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| you know, by noise or other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| and other impacts that detract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| from the immediate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| So I would say that denial is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7164)|
| 1:59:28| with our use and review standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7168)|
| 1:59:30| in addition to the points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| dozens of speakers have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| Okay, you said denial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| which you mean approving the appeal is what you mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7181)|
| 1:59:43| Denial of their request and approval of the appeal, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| Thank you for the clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7186)|
| 1:59:47| I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Okay, so we have a motion and a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| to approve the appeal from the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| So let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7197)|
| 2:00:01| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7201)|

| 2:00:12| Councilman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7213)|

| 2:00:19| Councilman, excuse me, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7219)|
| 2:00:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| And one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| Okay, and one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7225)|
| 2:00:26| So the appeal passes seven to one with one recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7226)|
| 2:00:33| Thank you and thank you all for being here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7233)|
| 2:00:58| Okay, we still have some resolutions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7258)|
| 2:01:00| Madam Mayor, could we perhaps take a five-minute break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| A five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| I thought that was a dance you do normally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150930?start=7266)|
