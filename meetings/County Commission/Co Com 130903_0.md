| 0:08:14| The chairman's appointment to commissioners on committee on committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| Committee on committees, stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=501)|
| 0:08:23| Let me get a copy of that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| We have a printed copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=506)|
| 0:08:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| The committee on committees will be the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Commissioner McKenzie, Amy Brolls, Jeff Olinby, Dave Wright, and Mike Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=536)|
| 0:09:12| The rules committee will be Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Brolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=552)|
| 0:09:18| Commissioner Hammond, Commissioner Brown, and Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=558)|
| 0:09:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Cable TV, I believe, can stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| But when we convene the cable TV committee, I'll have to be taken off of chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=573)|
| 0:09:40| And so it will be Sam McKenzie, Amy Brolls, Jeff Olinby, Richard Briggs, Brad Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=580)|
| 0:09:46| Larry Smith, Dave Wright, Mike Brown, and Ed Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=586)|
| 0:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=601)|
| 0:10:02| Now we're going to recess to convene the committee on committees, the cable TV committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| court subcommittee, finance subcommittee, and solvency board rules committee to elect the chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| vice chairman, and secretary of all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=610)|
| 0:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Commissioner McKenzie, will you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| Well, I guess the folks that need to vote, we need to pick a chair for that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=628)|
| 0:10:35| Current chair is Sam McKenzie, vice chair is Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| And we'll need a secretary also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| I think that's Mike Brown currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| So we'll call that committee on committees to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Do I hear a motion for chairman or a motion for nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| Well, prior to that, I was hoping to last year when this evolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=652)|
| 0:10:59| it came out afterwards that you can only chair one committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| And I was really liking to get back on the cable TV committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| Well, actually, all of us are on the cable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Well, I thought of chairing that committee if the committee would entertain that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| So prior to opening up nominations, since we're limited to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| A nomination for Dave Wright, chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Well, it has to come off the committee, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| On the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=685)|

| 0:11:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| Then I'll nominate Dave Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=689)|

| 0:11:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| So that now we would be accepting nominations for vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| Yeah, stand by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130903?start=707)|
