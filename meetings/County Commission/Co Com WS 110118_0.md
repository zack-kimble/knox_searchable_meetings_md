| 0:00:44| well as Alderman Bob Markley for hosting us for that lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=44)|

| 0:01:35| for coming out on a rainy afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=95)|

| 0:01:39| Sure, thank you Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Our first item is amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Does anyone have any amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| I would like to add Resolution 302.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| This is from the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Also, I would like to add Resolution 11-1-103 which is a resolution honoring the new Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=104)|
| 0:01:56| Daniel Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=116)|
| 0:01:57| Are there any other amendments to the agenda or deletions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=117)|
| 0:02:04| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| The Pam Rees report, we just wanted to delay that Mr. Chairman until all litigation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=126)|
| 0:02:14| over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| So, I don't know, I don't want to keep doing three, I don't know what's the best way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=135)|
| 0:02:18| approach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=138)|
| 0:02:21| We can table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| So, what number is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Is that a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| It's 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=148)|
| 0:02:29| So, item number 28 will be tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=149)|
| 0:02:33| No, I'm pardoning, 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| 37, Pam Rees report, we will just table that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| If we have time at the end, I would like to just take a very brief discussion on a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| items for your board that are going to be coming up just for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| Yes, sir, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=175)|
| 0:02:56| We will put that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=176)|
| 0:02:57| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Yes, I may have missed former Commissioner Craig Luthol and you are always dangerous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| when you are trying to recognize people and you miss someone, but he was here also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=185)|
| 0:03:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| It was my intent for the item that's listed in zonings on the hillside, the hillside plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| steep slope, and ridge top to be converted to a discussion item for us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=196)|
| 0:03:17| And then if it's acceptable to the commission that we would not, we wouldn't vote on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=197)|
| 0:03:41| until the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=221)|
| 0:03:43| So I just wanted to use today as to give an introduction to the topic and at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=223)|
| 0:03:50| a starting discussion of the topic and we have NPC staff here for a brief presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=230)|
| 0:03:58| during that time if that's acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| So we'll add that as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=241)|
| 0:04:06| It was a ridge top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| It was, it's on the zoning agenda, but we'll move that to a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| I'd like to be added to 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| I know you just added it, but I'd like to be added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| As a matter of fact, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| I'd like to add all the commission if that's appropriate for everyone to have a just full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=256)|
| 0:04:17| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| And he will be coming to our meeting next Monday so we can present this to him formally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Commissioner Norman, did you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Commissioner Shouse, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| If not, I'll be, do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added and delete, oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=263)|
| 0:04:24| come, Mr. Vandiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=264)|
| 0:04:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=265)|
| 0:04:44| If we might, could we defer item 13 until February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| We're still waiting on the contract from the Tennessee Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=288)|
| 0:04:53| Item 13 deferred until February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=293)|
| 0:04:54| Is there anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=294)|
| 0:04:55| If not, do I have a motion that we add what needs to be added, delete what needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| deleted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=300)|

| 0:05:13| Items number 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=313)|
| 0:05:42| 25, and I believe that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=342)|
| 0:05:52| Does anyone want any of those items pulled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=352)|

| 0:06:02| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| These mics are very sensitive, so even if you rustle paper, they'll come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Commissioner Shouse, did you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Number 34, we'll put those on consent as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| Those are drives and roads, and we'll do those separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Do I have a motion that all those items on consent be placed on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=375)|

| 0:06:44| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| The first item is on page 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=406)|
| 0:06:48| Item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| It is appointment Fred Coram and Bob Feeling and reappointing Tony Norman, Tommy Shumpert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| Resolution 111. Do I hear a motion? Is there a second? All those in favor? Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=415)|
| 0:07:05| I'm sorry, Mr. McKenzie. Thank you Mr. Chair. I guess as I start looking at the Greens Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=425)|
| 0:07:15| in terms of geographical diversity and diversity in general, I think we kind of need to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=435)|
| 0:07:23| infuse a little fresh blood into that committee. There's a lot going on out at Three Ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| It's a really nice facility that we've recently started to manage ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| I think we need to get some expertise in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| So with all those things in mind, I kind of like to look at the reappointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=458)|
| 0:07:47| and potentially substitute a name for someone that I think has been on there a considerable amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=467)|
| 0:07:54| I won't say a more qualified candidate, but someone that's kind of delved in and delved into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| some of the nuances of operating the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| That's kind of in general, but I can talk in more detail if the commissioners have questions with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=485)|
| 0:08:12| Do you have a name that you'd like to propose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| I'd like to propose Sam Anderson. He's recently retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| He has a wealth of experience with city parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| He's brought a couple of golf courses out of the ground as well as he's operated several for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=503)|
| 0:08:33| So I'd like to enter his name as a replacement for one of the people that's coming in as a reappointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=513)|
| 0:08:41| Do you have a specific name that you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| Just looking at it, I think Mr. Whitehead, I think he's been on that for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=523)|
| 0:08:50| I just think in time, I think there needs to be a little fresh blood with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=530)|
| 0:08:54| So if I would enter a name, I would strike Mr. Whitehead and add Sam Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| So is this an amendment to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| If the maker of the motion would take that as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| If not, I may have to substitute, but it's up to the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| That was yours. Would you accept that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| And the second was Commissioner Wright. Would you accept that, Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=558)|
| 0:09:20| So we're replacing John Whitehead with Sam Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| Any opposed? Motion passes. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=566)|
| 0:09:29| The next item is number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| It is confirming the Knox County Mayor's appointment of a hearing officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| for violations associated with the ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses within Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| This is Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| Mr. Law Director, Mr. Rice, do you have a name for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| Dean Rice, 806 Middlefield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| The mayor's been in conversation with an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| That individual has not agreed at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| They're considering it and would like to defer that for 30 days to let that person weigh the responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=593)|
| 0:10:00| Do we have a motion to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=600)|
| 0:10:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Is there a second? Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| It is deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| Item nine is appointing an individual to the Knox County Personnel Board, Resolution 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| Do we have a name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| Anyone here from Human Resources?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| Do we have a name for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| This is a commission appointment, too, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=631)|
| 0:10:32| We don't have a name, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I move that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=636)|
| 0:10:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| And we'll get on that, Francis, and make sure we get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Motion passes, deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=644)|
| 0:10:46| The next item is on page three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| It's item 12, a resolution regarding the distribution of proceeds from property forfeited as a result of criminal activity, Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=648)|
| 0:10:57| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Sheriff, would you explain this to us and let us know about the distribution of proceeds from property forfeited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=662)|
| 0:11:11| Oh, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| It's item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=672)|
| 0:11:13| It's the resolution regarding the distribution of proceeds from property forfeited as a result of criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=673)|
| 0:11:29| If I could, the Sheriff's correct, members of the commission, in a nutshell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=689)|
| 0:11:33| Tennessee law mandates that you, in fact, have some local enabling legislation before you can actually retain those monies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| If not, they're subject to being returned to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| Motion has been made and property seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| Quick question on that, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| J.J., how often do you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=712)|
| 0:11:53| How often?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Usually two or three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| And if there are rules and regulations, it has to be posted in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| and we have to give public notice and those type of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| And I think usually we try to do them about three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=721)|
| 0:12:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| Item 15 is a resolution approving a contract in the amount of $182,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| 100% is federally funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| With the Tennessee Department of Transportation, TDOT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| for the development of a signal system communications master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| and signal timing optimization program, Resolution 403.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| Who do we have here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| Thanks, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Could you tell us a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=769)|
| 0:12:50| I'm just a little curious when it comes to traffic issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| and given the way things are, all this modernization and technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| that goes into traffic governance right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| And some of it I fear and some of it I think gets in the way of good driving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| But just let me know something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| I don't know anything about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Certainly, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| And no reason to fear this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| CMAQ funds are congestion mitigation air quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| and it's a reasonable question to ask what does that have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| with traffic signalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=802)|
| 0:13:24| But we will have a contractor that will be hired through a competitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| bidding process who will actually go out and look at I think it's a total| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| of 74 different signalized intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| And they put out tubes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| They actually set out observers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| And they look for the most efficient ways to move traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| through those intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| limit the amount of time that vehicles spend queuing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| and just improve the overall efficiency of the intersections just to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| the flow of vehicles on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| And the whole point of it obviously is just to reduce idling time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| and the amount of time people spend ineffectively sitting at lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| And that's why CMAQ funds contemplate this kind of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Dwight, is this state roads in the county only or county and city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| I think it's a hybrid or it's a mix, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| because some of these were signalized intersections that were previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| in the county that had subsequently been annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=862)|
| 0:14:25| but we may still maintain operation of the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| Some of them are exclusively 14, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| are exclusively unincorporated county, and then the balance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| which is around 60, are a mix between the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| In my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=877)|
| 0:14:38| they're going to have to wait about three years to make it correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| because we've got a lot of changes out there due to the closing of the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| So they're working with that weekly right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| making changes even probably as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| But I was just wondering if it would include both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=893)|
| 0:14:55| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=895)|
| 0:14:57| We have a motion that's been made and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Item 16 is a resolution approving a contract with Goodwill Industries Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| to provide comprehensive recycling and reuse services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| at Knox County Convenience Centers, resolution 404.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Dwight, if you would give us the details of this contract, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| Certainly, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| We have an arrangement with Goodwill Industries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It's a contract that's been in place for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| It's now expired, and we seek to renew it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| They staff collection centers at three of our convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| Dutchtown Road, Halls, and John Sevier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| which are three of our highest volume centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| They help with recycling, and under the scope of this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| which is in expanded services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=946)|
| 0:15:48| they're going to have e-waste collection at all three of these centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=948)|
| 0:15:54| Just to correct a little misconception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=954)|
| 0:15:56| e-waste is anything basically that has a power cord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| People these days tend to think of it strictly as computers and monitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| and things like that, and that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| It's everything from computers to irons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Goodwill collects those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=967)|
| 0:16:09| They will take them to their centers and attempt to resell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| The value to the county comes from the fact that those are heavy items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| and we avoid introducing them into the compactors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| That saves us money on full compactors that have to be hauled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| It saves us money on compactors that have to go into the landfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=987)|
| 0:16:28| There's more to it than that, but that's sort of it in a nutshell, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| Dwight, they do the taking of the leaves and stuff, and they charge $5 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| Is there a charge if you're going to drop off an iron?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Is there going to be a charge for that or computers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| No, sir, and they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| A good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| I appreciate you reminding me of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| They are going to take over the operation of the green waste trailer at the Halls Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| and they will be responsible for the collection of the fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| and there is a set fee structure that they have to observe that's essentially the same as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1015)|
| 0:17:00| We will no longer be involved in the cash collection portion of that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Goodwill is going to collect the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| They're going to keep the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Knox County is going to haul the full box to the landfill and obviously deposit it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1028)|
| 0:17:18| Goodwill will reimburse the county for the cost of hauling it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| and they will also reimburse the county for what's called the tipping fee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1041)|
| 0:17:26| which is the cost of dropping the green waste off at the collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| Will they still get the receipts to the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| Will this be extended to other convenience centers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| I know you named three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| Will they go survey other places like Gibbs, for example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| I certainly think they're open to it, Commissioner, and we are as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Frequently when you're at a convenience center and you see two people there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| you may assume both of them are staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| Often one is a staff member and one is a Goodwill employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| So this really leverages dollars for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1079)|
| 0:18:02| It helps an awful lot to have a second, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| pair of boots on the ground at the convenience centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| and in this particular case we're not paying for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| So we'll be certainly glad to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| You mentioned the e-waste, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| Recently you had one at two centers, a one-day deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1098)|
| 0:18:22| Will this be a continuous, or is it going to have to be on a certain day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| Can the e-waste, you know, computers and stuff be brought in at any time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| They can be brought in at any time to those three centers, those three staff centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| And mindful of the fact, Commissioner, that probably Forks of the River is the closest one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| or the John Sevier Center is the closest one to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| One other thing I forgot to mention, thinking of these things as I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Goodwill is also going to take on as a part of this process large televisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| and that's a big help to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1131)|
| 0:18:54| They will keep them out of the compactor, and those are a hard thing for us to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1134)|
| 0:19:00| Goodwill is going to take those on as well at those three centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| and the volume of TVs that comes through a convenience center is pretty substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| John Sevier definitely is close to me because I can throw a rock and hit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| but I had several questions after the last special day you had for the computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| you know, the e-equipment, to try to set it up next time at South.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1156)|
| 0:19:21| But if you're going to do that on a continuing basis, then that's going to help everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1167)|
| 0:19:29| Commissioner Andrews, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| Dwight, tell me, I know what we were doing in the past to get the green waste out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1173)|
| 0:19:38| How much is Goodwill going to have to pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| What kind of profit are they going to make on that, or how is that working?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| You know, I'd be reluctant to speculate on how much revenue Goodwill might make, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| I don't think it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| At the end of the day, in the past when this has been discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| and people talked about the fees that were collected at the Goodwill trailer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| those were gross revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| The county still had to pay the cost of hauling the full boxes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| and we also had to pay the cost of dropping off the green waste at the processor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1205)|
| 0:20:11| So we were clearing on an annual basis maybe $2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| I don't know that Goodwill will be able to develop a business model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| that's going to let them generate much more revenue than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| I don't really think that's their intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| The e-waste collection and the resale of those items will certainly be useful for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And also, frankly, it's a place for them to put Goodwill clients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| slash staff in a work environment and help them with the process of getting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| What's it going to cost to haul one of those out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| We're going to charge them $50, which is our hard cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| We're not going to charge them depreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| Okay, because I know how much money they've got in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| Yeah, they'll make some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| Well, I guess along those same lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| I think you answered Commissioner Smith's question about receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| I don't think we're going to be auditing that or monitoring that or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| So we really don't care whether, to be quite honest, once we've signed this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| whether they give a receipt to their client or customer or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| Is that a true statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| No, sir, not entirely because the contract does specify a fee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| We didn't feel comfortable leaving it open-ended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| We wanted to make sure that we had an understanding of what Goodwill could charge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| and that they wouldn't deviate from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Our goal is fundamentally to keep the service in place and hauled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| Once you've got something like a green waste trailer in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| and the public becomes accustomed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| very, very difficult to cease providing the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| And for Commissioner Smith's constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| their alternatives are Forks of the River and Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| They're not good alternatives and they're not close by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| So it was important to the mayor's office to keep the service in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| but we needed some controls to make sure that Goodwill didn't try to turn this into some sort of profit center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| that would involve pricing that wasn't necessarily acceptable to what the county thought was appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| So we do have a fee structure in place, and regardless of receipts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| I think certainly we'll be doing spot checks to make sure that they aren't deviating from the fee structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| Okay. So with that said, you all will do a lightweight kind of audit of what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Yes, sir. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| Any other questions for Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| So you're saying then that what we had into it was a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| The county's going to end up losing some money because we're not going to do it anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| So we're going to lose, what did you say, about $2,500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1356)|
| 0:22:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Now, it's hard for me to project, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1360)|
| 0:22:42| but we'll more than make that back in savings in terms of reduced costs for full compactors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1362)|
| 0:22:49| When you talk about going across at three of our busiest centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| and diverting everything from televisions to old computer monitors to waffle irons out of compactors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1373)|
| 0:23:01| and into that Goodwill trailer, and also Goodwill will have just general drop-off centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1381)|
| 0:23:08| They'll take other used material that the public wants to bring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| All that gets diverted out of the garbage compactor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Anything that gets diverted out of the garbage compactor is a net savings to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| I just didn't want us to turn away something that was giving us $75,000 to $100,000 as income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| but you're saying it's only giving us $25,000. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| All those were gross figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| See, we were always paying the tipping fee and the haul costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| and generally those costs were not a part of those earlier discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1411)|
| 0:23:39| Do you have a question or comment you would like to make on this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| My name is Bradley J. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| He made a statement about how we were off about $2,500 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| I probably know the haul's green waste numbers better than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1434)|
| 0:23:58| Mr. Smith went out there with me when we pulled our sting, when we caught the money being embezzled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1438)|
| 0:24:04| The real numbers around hauls land around $16,000 a year of money that's collected in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1444)|
| 0:24:11| We're going to run just a little bit under that in disposal fees from what I saw when I reviewed the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1451)|
| 0:24:18| Of course, now a lot of the receipts were thrown away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| That's been admitted here recently, but it's hard for a lot of people to get a grasp on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| because in the past your solid waste department had only been budgeting $1,000 a year expected income there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| I went, and of course that was way off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| I've seen the real numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| I've seen the real books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| You actually collect about $16,000 a year in green waste disposal fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1486)|
| 0:24:51| The best I could figure, you were spending around $14,000 in disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| but that does not calculate in for what you're spending in county labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| such as involved with trucking and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| If your numbers stay the same as what they were before, it's about a break-even deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1505)|
| 0:25:09| You don't make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1509)|
| 0:25:11| Previous to me and Commissioner Smith and I think Mr. VanGilder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| you were losing about $15,000 a year that was just disappearing in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1516)|
| 0:25:23| Right now, if the numbers and the books stay about the same, it's actually a break-even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| You shouldn't lose any money from what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| It's hard to tell now because so many receipts were thrown away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1531)|
| 0:25:36| and only $1,000 was provable missing, but me and Commissioner Smith know otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| If you've got a convenience store you want us to check out, we'll go check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Larry Smith won't saddle up and go out there and get the records,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| but that's the real numbers of your hauls money out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Mr. Smith can verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| We actually tallied six months of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1558)|
| 0:26:01| and compared that to the haul-out fees and all when we were tracking down that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| So we know a real good figure for a six-month sample very accurately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Mr. Chairman, I don't want to get into too much discussion because he's in litigation with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| so there are some other figures out there and I don't want to jeopardize this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| because I want to get it over with, but thank you, Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Motion passes. Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| The next item is on page 4, item 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| It's a resolution approving the second amendment to the Medical Screening Services Agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| Asylum Health Services, LLC, relative to the Tennessee Refugee Medical Screening Program, Resolution 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1598)|
| 0:26:45| Is there a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Is someone here from the Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| If you could explain to us, I had asked this to be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| I'm not familiar with the Tennessee Refugee Medical Screening Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Could you give us some details on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| Yes, Mark Miller, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| All refugees arriving in the United States are required to get certain immunizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1629)|
| 0:27:15| and have a medical screening to prevent communicable disease spread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| and this organization out of Nashville contracts with us to do that service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| Are these local dollars or state dollars that are expended on this, or federal dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| I don't know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| The money that comes to us from the organization in Nashville, I'm not sure I can get that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| But the money is coming from somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1659)|
| 0:27:41| These are not Knox County dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1668)|
| 0:27:50| The next item is on page 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1670)|
| 0:27:53| It's Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| It's requesting the public billing authority of the County of Knox and the City of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| to approve and authorize certain energy conservation services and installations for the City-County building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1680)|
| 0:28:05| to be provided pursuant to the Energy Services Agreement between the City and Americo, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1685)|
| 0:28:13| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| Motion's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Is there someone here from Finance that can address this, I guess address the next two items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| Someone here from Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1708)|
| 0:28:31| Mr. Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| I'm not from Finance and I cannot address these two issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| but John Troyer is actually in an RFP committee meeting regarding the bid for the Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1715)|
| 0:28:43| So he was not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1723)|
| 0:28:44| I thought that he was going to have someone here representing him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| and we'll text to see if we can get them here by the time that you're finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| We'll just hold these then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Can we hold these until the end of the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I was going to make a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1736)|
| 0:28:57| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| We can go ahead and pass them, then we can ask questions next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| So you want to send it on without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| Yes, I'll make a substitute motion to send on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| It sends on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Yes, 23 and 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1752)|
| 0:29:18| So the next item is 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1758)|
| 0:29:20| It's a resolution requesting that the Knox County Law Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and the Knox County Finance Director provide the Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| with, number one, the status of efforts to recover public monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| alleged to have been misappropriated by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| and or improperly paid to Knox County employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1772)|
| 0:29:35| and, number two, the status of the TBI investigation of former Knox County trustee employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1775)|
| 0:29:39| Johnny Hahn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| This is resolution 902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1783)|
| 0:29:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1784)|
| 0:29:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1785)|
| 0:29:46| I'd like to add an amendment to this that was mine that we do this monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| The reason I'm doing this is this has been two years that this investigation has been going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| and it has nothing to do with the current trustee's office or the current trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| But it seems to me that if we have an investigation going on two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| we should at least know something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| We do know that monies have been taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Monies have not been sent back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1805)|
| 0:30:10| I don't know that the finance director really has a lot to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| I think this is more in the law director's realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| But I would like to make that amendment that we have a monthly report from our law director on the status of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| My goal here is just to keep this before the public because this needs to be resolved one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| This has gone on too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| If the maker of the motion will accept that amendment, I'd like to get a monthly report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| Commissioner McKenzie, did you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| I guess I'd like to know what form are you expecting the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Do you want the law director to have something written and present at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| or do we just want to get a letter or something of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| I'd like for him to present it at the meeting if that would be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1848)|
| 0:30:50| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| At our regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| Okay, motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1855)|
| 0:30:56| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| The next item is 27.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| It's a resolution requesting the Rules Committee to consider amending the Knox County Commission rules for the zoning session to begin at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| or immediately following the conclusion of the commission's legislative agenda, Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| Let me say, Commissioners, that a couple of you came to me after our meeting and said we started at 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| and said let's look at maybe moving zonings up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| That's why I put it on to be referred to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| So is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| Motion made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1891)|
| 0:31:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| We can have the Rules Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| Stand by here just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| We can have the Rules Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Is there a luncheon Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| 1250 on Monday at the 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1910)|
| 0:31:54| Is that enough time, Joe Lee, to get everything together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1914)|
| 0:31:59| Ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Commissioner Norman, did you have your line up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Do you think we need more than ten minutes to discuss it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| We may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| I'll restate my concern here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| I know we discussed this one of your first days in office as the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| I just strongly believe, and it's not just because I'm a working person, but I strongly believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| and I feel that working people would rather us meeting after work hours as opposed to during work hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1951)|
| 0:32:39| I feel that looking at the past, when there's a big issue like a Carter or Midway, folks start to stream in after work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1959)|
| 0:32:47| and most of the county employees that would avail themselves to stay out later are salaried employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1967)|
| 0:32:55| and that's not a huge expectation of them to stay late once or twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| I think it's a nice convenience for us, and it's working well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| but if we're really about getting the citizens out and involved in our process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1983)|
| 0:33:10| I think we're moving things into the core of the day, where I think that's probably the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| But we can discuss it again on Monday, but I do think that it may take a little more than ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| Well, if it's okay with the Chairman, we'll move the Rules Committee to next month, and we'll discuss it next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| As I say, I brought this up because a couple of you had asked me to consider that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| and so the proper way to do it is send it to Rules for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| So Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2020)|
| 0:33:41| I just wanted to throw this out there, too, for everyone to be thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| And who all is on the Rules Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| I am, and Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| Who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| Make sure that everyone contact a Rules Committee member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2031)|
| 0:33:55| and let us know what your preference is before we go in and have a meeting about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| Via the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| Yes, via the forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| But it's been suggested by constituents that we may want to look at moving the Commission meeting to 4 o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| and having zoning stay at 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2054)|
| 0:34:18| And I think that's definitely worth considering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| especially if we're talking about wanting to meet at times that are most convenient for the majority of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| So we can be thinking that over as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| Who else had a?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| I will give you my opinion at this point, and it won't have to be by forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| We're not here to serve at our own convenience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| We're here to serve the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| And I would agree with Commissioner McKenzie that there are a lot of people who are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| I know in the last 38 years I've been beating the bushes at MPC and County Commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| and before that the three-member County Court meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2099)|
| 0:35:02| And it's not always convenient to do that in the middle of the day on some of these zoning matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| So I believe we owe it to the people to have it when it's most convenient to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| Five o'clock, you know, would be the earliest that I could see it happening for that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| As far as moving to commission time, keep moving it up too far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2120)|
| 0:35:25| then we're going to wind up being here until midnight again on these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| So I'll take that into consideration too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| But definitely I think we need to keep this zoning part no earlier than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| Any other comments from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| And then looking at the last sentence that's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| it's following the conclusion of the commission meeting, commission's legislative agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2143)|
| 0:35:51| I agree with Commissioner Brown, five o'clock is about as early, but it's got to be a time-specific meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| So I can't go with the last sentence either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| The motion is to send it to the Rules Committee for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| and have them bring us back a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| It's been motioned and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| So it goes to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| Commissioner Andrews, did you say you want it for February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| This will be on February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Or you'll set the meeting for February?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| We'll set the meeting for February, close to the commission meeting in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| Page six, item 28, is a resolution requesting that the Knotts County Mayor amend the Knotts County Employee Handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2190)|
| 0:36:37| to add a section to preclude Knotts County from remitting severance payments to county employees for work not performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2197)|
| 0:36:43| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| Have you received a copy of the Mayor's proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Mr. Rice is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| Before we ask for a motion on this, Mr. Rice, would you like to address us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Please, Mr. Chair, I'll bring this forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2217)|
| 0:37:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| The Mayor has implemented and is asking the commission to codify through your personnel policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| a no-severance policy for Knotts County employees who either resign or terminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| or otherwise leave employment with the county that includes all executive branch employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| including the Mayor's office as well as any department directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| There is the exception to a flat no-severance policy that if, in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| budget revenues projections necessitate a reduction in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| that there would be an opportunity for the Mayor in consultation with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| to implement a voluntary early retirement program that would be offered across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| to all executive branch employees nearing retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| That's been done by the State of Tennessee and a number of other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| with a cost savings as long as those lines of employment are eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| and you are no longer having that recurring cost of benefits and salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| But aside from that option, that is not a requirement or mandated by any means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| but an option if the numbers so require that there would be otherwise there would be no severance offered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2296)|
| 0:38:24| And the key things that the Mayor in conversations with Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| and other commissioners has been that this policy needs to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| it needs to be applied equally across the board of the executive branch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| and it needs to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| And this, in conversations with the Human Resources Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| with Francis, who's done a great deal of work on this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| as well as in conversations with Mr. Jarrett, this accomplishes those three guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| Questions for Mr. Rice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Yes, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| I mean, Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| I don't mind, Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| I'm not in favor of this, and I'm sure you're not surprised by that because you know how I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| But one of the problems I have with approving this is because it is not implemented fairly and across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| It only impacts one section of county employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| And if we look back at the severance payments that have been paid over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| the majority of them don't even fall in this section that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| They're from the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| They're from all these other departments where the mayor does not have the jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2367)|
| 0:39:33| or we do not have the jurisdiction to enforce this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| And I think that all county employees should be treated the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| whether you work in the Register of Deeds office or you work in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| or you work in the county commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| So, again, I see this as trying to do something because of public outcry that makes it look like something's being accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2387)|
| 0:39:59| but it actually doesn't do anything to fix what we all consider or what many people consider to be the initial problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2399)|
| 0:40:06| It's not going to affect these departments where the majority of these severance payments were made over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| So I can't support it for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| And I also feel very strongly that we need to be competitive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| and I don't think that having an occasional severance where appropriate is a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2419)|
| 0:40:29| So that's where I stand on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| I guess I agree with Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2437)|
| 0:40:43| I think I can't get behind this policy, but is there any way that we can ask the trustee's office, the Register of Deeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2443)|
| 0:40:52| this makes sense for Knox County, and I think public outcry is not limited to the executive branch of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2452)|
| 0:41:00| So can we, prior to enacting this, gain consensus from the other fee offices for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2460)|
| 0:41:08| Just ask the question to Foster and Sherry and Duncan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| Will you embrace these policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| We've done the due diligence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| This makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| This is obviously what the county wants, what the county citizens want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| And then bring this policy up as a countywide program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| So that's a question to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| Mr. Rice, Mr. Jarrett wants to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| So if I can get him to weigh in on it, then we'll get your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Just from the legal perspective, Commissioner, your terminology is spot on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2496)|
| 0:41:42| Can we ask those separate elected officials, although they come under the charter, the charter defers to the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2502)|
| 0:41:50| State law actually outlines the duties, responsibilities, and powers of those separate offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2510)|
| 0:41:55| So, yeah, you'd have to get a buy-in, and it'd have to be voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| It can't be compulsory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| That makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| To me, you know, and I'm not, I don't hold an office, but it would make sense, so I guess I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| If I might, and, again, unfortunately, Mayor Burchett was unable to be here to address this specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| But we have had conversation on that, and the mayor recognizes that the limitations of the executive branch are just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| Their limitations and policies that he can recommend are within the scope of his authority as Knox County Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2542)|
| 0:42:28| He is not the trustee or the register of deeds or any other officeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2548)|
| 0:42:32| That would be a decision made by those duly elected constitutional offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| and he would not be, he's not in a position to tell another officeholder what their personnel policy should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2556)|
| 0:42:43| With that said, though, he does feel strongly that in this situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| given the fiscal constraints facing the county at this time and looking forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2566)|
| 0:42:51| this is the appropriate action for him to take for all those employees under his direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| and he asks that commission support him in that if commission wishes to ask other offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2577)|
| 0:43:02| I believe you would find that that would be something for you to address with those other officeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| Well, I guess in terms of a question, can we ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Can the executive branch and the commission ask jointly the fee offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2591)|
| 0:43:16| And I think we have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2596)|
| 0:43:18| You can ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| I don't think you plan on giving any severances out over the next three to five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| so can we start a process by where we're asking them to embrace this policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2604)|
| 0:43:32| and agree to and adhere to this policy prior to us passing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| Because, again, I like the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I do have a detailed question, but is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| I can certainly say that that would be something that the commission, if Mr. Jarrett agrees, would be free to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2623)|
| 0:43:51| The mayor is going to implement this policy within the employee's handbook immediately, effective immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| asking that the personnel policies be codified in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| But I believe, Mr. Jarrett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| that it's within the purview of the executive branch to implement the general policies of employment, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2644)|
| 0:44:11| So it will be implemented as of today by direction of the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| and then asking you to codify it to make it going forward in perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| So I'm going to ask my detailed question because I don't want to take too much time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2662)|
| 0:44:26| Now, in terms of what you said about any employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2666)|
| 0:44:31| if we have a general reduction in force process because, you know, we need to cut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2671)|
| 0:44:38| are you going to identify certain departments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| I guess when I read the word any employee, if we're appropriately staffed in the sheriff, just pick one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2681)|
| 0:44:48| I'm just picking one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| But we're overstaffed in parks and rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| We're not going to allow the sheriff folks to leave because that would create a deficit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| I didn't read that in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Well, the sheriff would be separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| Let's say parks and rec and libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Well, let's use parks and rec and libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2705)|
| 0:45:06| The intent, and I can talk to Francis if you are here, maybe you could address it more specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| but the intent is to disallow any individualization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| just to say you may choose an early retirement employee A, but you employees, you know, B through Z, you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2715)|
| 0:45:23| It needs to be applied across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| It needs to be equal where everyone knows as an employee within the executive branch this is a set policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| There's no favoritism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2731)|
| 0:45:32| There's no selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2732)|
| 0:45:33| It is that now whether that can be done if a department needs to be reduced because of budget constraints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2733)|
| 0:45:40| then whether or not that early retirement can be offered within a specific department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| excluding the others, would be Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2744)|
| 0:45:55| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| Could you come to the microphone so everyone can hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2758)|
| 0:46:07| Whenever you develop a voluntary early retirement incentive program, you could target it as you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| You would decide how many years of service, what age, what the parameters for participation would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2775)|
| 0:46:24| but the stipulation is that it has to be voluntary, person self-select to participate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2784)|
| 0:46:32| and that you have to offer them something to which they are not ordinarily entitled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2792)|
| 0:46:38| So that's why you typically, you know, add four months additional buyout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| But that would be for the early retirement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2804)|
| 0:46:47| We're not talking about a reduction in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| Separate program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Commissioner Andrews, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2814)|
| 0:46:55| I do, and it's just basically a detailed question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| You talk about two different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| What are the limits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| I don't see any limits on either program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Is that up to commission on each individual reduction in workforce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| Well, the one program, there would be limits in terms of compensation or limits in terms of scope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Term, you know, say we're giving them four months or three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| What determines how many months we're giving them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| Well, the only situation where any severance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| or any package would be offered to an employee would be under the early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| The other, it is the annual leave that you have earned as well as any comp time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| if you're a comp time employee, that you would have as you exit your employment with the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| Now, under the voluntary retirement, and this is not, I want to stress this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| this is not something that the mayor in any way is saying that he's going to implement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2859)|
| 0:47:43| What he's looking at is do you want to leave an option available for the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| if the fiscal reality requires a significant reduction in force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2868)|
| 0:47:54| So that would go to some of the standards that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Francis said four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| I don't, you know, wouldn't know exactly what that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| We're not going to put that in policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| We're just going to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2882)|
| 0:48:03| No, and it does state, though, and it would be asked that you include this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2883)|
| 0:48:07| that it be able to fit within the boundaries of the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| that the money would have to be there in order to offer whatever is offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| and it would be in consultation with commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2895)|
| 0:48:17| This is not something that would be done by a fiat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| Mr. Ferguson, can we, instead of compensation, can we extend medical benefits for six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2900)|
| 0:48:27| I mean, until they pick, let's say we've got somebody that's fixing to hit Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| and Medicaid and they take the voluntary retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Are you speaking within the voluntary retirement program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Yes, it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| But extend them six months medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| It could be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| So we can do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| We put some language in here that says that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| we can select what the incentive is based upon, you know, the needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| what we're trying to accomplish, what savings level we're trying to get to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| and what is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| So, yes, it could be either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| And or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2942)|
| 0:49:03| So they're not having the inclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2943)|
| 0:49:04| Or none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2944)|
| 0:49:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| So it could be either is just to make sure that we make the best decision for the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| and for where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| Mr. Brown, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| Francis, I know when this first came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| you had some serious concerns about a no-severance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2958)|
| 0:49:24| Are you comfortable now with have your concerns been satisfied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| or do you still see some potential difficulties moving forward with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| Well, our primary concern was having a never-ever policy that said we would never,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| ever have severance regardless of the circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2981)|
| 0:49:45| And I think there may someday be a circumstance where we need to have a reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2985)|
| 0:49:50| So in that regard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| I think that having the voluntary early retirement incentive program addresses that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=2992)|
| 0:50:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| And then secondly, do I want to pay severance for every reduction in force or layoff we might have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3003)|
| 0:50:10| Well, you know, that's a budgetary concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3010)|
| 0:50:14| So this addresses my primary objection to the first policy, which said never, ever, never, ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| You know, I would also warn against a always, always policy too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3022)|
| 0:50:27| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| And also, would it be possible to amend this to say that we will, in addition to codifying this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3029)|
| 0:50:40| that we will send a request to those fee offices asking for their cooperation in terms of their own personnel policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3040)|
| 0:50:52| Can I offer that as a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| We don't have a motion on the floor at this point, but if you'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Are we discussing without a motion in a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| No, we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| Who made the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3068)|
| 0:51:09| No, I did not ask for a motion because we hadn't seen the policy yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| and I'd asked for Mr. Rice to present it to us, so we do not have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| Do you want to include that, Larry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| So you'll include the motion, the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| And I support that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3083)|
| 0:51:25| I think that's a good plan, but, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| until I hear that all the other departments are going to be doing the same thing, I'm not going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| I don't think it's fair to treat some employees differently than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| I had two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| You know, we're talking about the fee offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Something that's a lot bigger than the Register of the Deeds office is the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| I mean, that's thousands of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Are we going to do the same thing to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| I have about three comments or questions I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| The second question deals with when the state has made their reductions in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3116)|
| 0:52:04| and these are involuntary reductions, do they offer those folks any sort of severance to leave early or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| I'm not talking about early retirement, but just, you know, we'll give you a month's pay if you want to leave now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3131)|
| 0:52:17| or do they just go through and fire people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| Some people maybe want to look for, I mean, what's a precedent in the public, still in the public sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| not the private sector, on how severances are handled if you have a reduction in force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| I'm just asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| One thing that we have found is that there is a woeful lack of consistent policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| not only in the state of Tennessee but around the country for municipalities, local, state, or city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3159)|
| 0:52:46| I don't believe that Hamilton, Davidson, or Shelby have any policy whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3166)|
| 0:52:53| And so in the state, I believe it's been done differently at different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| And so this, going back to what Mayor Burchett's goal is, is to set in place a clear, concise, consistent plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3176)|
| 0:53:05| that is applied equally across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3185)|
| 0:53:07| and I've just received a text from the Knox County trustee saying that he's in support of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3187)|
| 0:53:13| and his office will follow this guide as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| I guess my only question is that sometimes it can actually be beneficial to the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| If you say, you know, we're willing to give you two weeks' pay, we're willing to give you whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| if you're willing to leave early rather than just going across the board and firing people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| I mean, that's really what a reduction of force is, firing people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| Some of those people may need the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Some people may not need the job so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| And that it's easier to do it that way than just to say we're going to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3221)|
| 0:53:46| and eeny, meeny, miny, moe, and every third person we're going to fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| And that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| What have they done at the state level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| May I point out that Knox County government does have a reduction in force policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| That is part of the base personnel policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| So we already have some structure for should we require a reduction in force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3241)|
| 0:54:06| Well, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3246)|
| 0:54:07| But, see, what my question is, are those people given any pay for work not done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| See, that's what this is all about, pay for work not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3253)|
| 0:54:18| Well, this would be something to discuss going forward and have a conversation with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| Again, he is wanting to have his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| And also keep in mind that this is if in looking at this situation, this is not a pleasant thing to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Anytime you're looking at the potential down the road of asking and telling anyone that they are going to no longer be in the employment of the company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| or the county or whoever, that's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| The difference here between what this county puts in place and what a business puts in place is that this isn't our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| This is the money of the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| And this has to be put in always going back to the notion that this mayor and you as a body are spending taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3293)|
| 0:55:02| And that does put a different light on the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3302)|
| 0:55:09| We have a motion on the floor now, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3311)|
| 0:55:12| This was handed to us just right when this discussion started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| And I really haven't had a chance to really think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| Do we want to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| You know, I would like to make a substitute motion to defer this maybe until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| We could probably do it with a relatively short discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| But this was just given to us all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| We've not had a chance to look at it, not had a chance to talk to anyone about it, get any feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3329)|
| 0:55:34| And that would be my only concern about giving something and voting on it immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3334)|
| 0:55:38| The motion is to defer until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Well, we've got to withdraw the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| I'll withdraw the second on the first motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| So the motion is, is there a second to Commissioner Bridge's motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Let's continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Anything else, Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| No, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| That gives us time to connect the, to contact the other fee officers, too, like you overheard from John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Yeah, I agree with Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| I want to look at this a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3361)|
| 0:56:03| Can you give us some, this doesn't give us specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Can you tell us, I mean, some scenarios?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| What are we looking at here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| Because this is the first I'm hearing of, you're saying severance packages for four months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| We're saying severed packages for no months for no one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| But in terms of a voluntary retirement situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| the scenario would be if revenues projections show that this county cannot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| the executive branch of this county cannot afford to have 917 employees going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| And that's going to have to be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| Is one option for reducing that would be to go to those people near, at or near retirement age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| and saying here is an option for you to retire now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| And then that position not be filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| And so you have those savings going forward forever of not paying those benefits or that salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3408)|
| 0:56:54| Now what that number would be, this is intentionally left up open so that the consultation can be made at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3414)|
| 0:57:03| whether it's two years, five years, ten years, whenever that conversation would take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| with the commission and the mayor can have that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3428)|
| 0:57:11| and come to an understanding within the parameters of the budget at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| What money exists, what can be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| It would be very arbitrary to put a set time on it at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| Frances, give me an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3442)|
| 0:57:23| You've got somebody, this Parks and Rec, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3443)|
| 0:57:26| Somebody's Parks and Rec and they're cutting grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| And they're in their 30s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3450)|
| 0:57:32| And we're doing away with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3452)|
| 0:57:34| We don't have anywhere else to put them because Parks and Rec got somebody outside to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3454)|
| 0:57:40| What would be offered to those individuals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| Nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3464)|
| 0:57:45| But we don't have a place for them in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| You're talking about somebody who would not be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3470)|
| 0:57:52| We're not talking about a specialized early retirement program now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| You're talking about a layoff of an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| I thought that's what you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| If technology comes and all of a sudden we don't need this department or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| Are we getting confused here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3488)|
| 0:58:09| I think we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| We're talking about two different programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| What we're saying is for a layoff, a resignation, a termination, that type thing, no payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3494)|
| 0:58:26| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3506)|
| 0:58:27| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3507)|
| 0:58:28| What we're saying, we're leaving the door open to if we find ourselves in a situation where we do need to eliminate a number of positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3508)|
| 0:58:36| we want to say that we will implement a voluntary early retirement incentive program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3516)|
| 0:58:45| which has some federal laws that must be adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| So that's a very structured program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| The federal law doesn't tell you what the incentive should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3534)|
| 0:58:58| and we've placed a notation in this policy that the incentives were based on the availability of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3538)|
| 0:59:06| and the projected savings of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| So that is a program that will be designed at that point when we need it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| and we know what kind of savings we're trying to achieve, what kind of funding is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| how many positions we would like to eliminate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| But when we're talking about an involuntary program, a regular reduction in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3564)|
| 0:59:29| or an ordinary layoff of a department or one individual position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| this policy states that the severance to be received is zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3575)|
| 0:59:41| I like what you said, Dean, where it's as long as we've gotten the budget, I like that part of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3581)|
| 0:59:46| and the fact that it comes back to commission because before, evidently, I think it was PBA, Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| there were all sorts of stuff given away at PBA that we didn't know anything about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| And I do want to stress to you that this is not the involuntary retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| it is not something that would be mandated to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| It is something that would just be an option that would be on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3605)|
| 1:00:09| You, the mayor at that time, and the commission at that time would not have to use that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| but it would be there if it was necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| Commissioner Briggs, to answer your question on what the state does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| it's not consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3620)|
| 1:00:21| They distinguish between career, non-career service, cabinet positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3621)|
| 1:00:25| However, in general, they require a 90-day notice requirement for anybody who is going to suffer a reduction in force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3625)|
| 1:00:32| and the state is required to attempt to re-employ these people with a comparable agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3632)|
| 1:00:39| But that's about the most consistent thing the state does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| Beyond that, it leaves a lot of these decisions up to the individual cabinet positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| the different career service paths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| So those are basically your two big options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3649)|
| 1:00:50| One, ample notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| Two, the possibility to make every effort for re-employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| Commissioner Olenby, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Okay, Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3657)|
| 1:00:59| Francis, I hate to ask more work of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| but would it be possible by the end of this week to email each commissioner a copy of our reduction in force policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3663)|
| 1:01:13| And if you have at your disposal the policies dealing with any of this from the fee offices, the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3673)|
| 1:01:23| the sheriff's department, any that might differ, if you could get those copies of those emailed to us as well so that we can compare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3683)|
| 1:01:31| And, Larry, I want to make sure that we all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| I want to make sure that I've got this right, too, because this is one of my big objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3697)|
| 1:01:41| that what we're talking about in acting would not, if it had been in place years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3701)|
| 1:01:46| it would not have had any effect on all of those severances that came to light a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3706)|
| 1:01:53| They would have still happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| And going forward, if the other independent offices don't agree to this, they can still happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| We don't have any way of preventing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| So all of those that you were talking about, the ones that got everybody so riled up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| we have no way to stop those unless those independent departments agree to this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3730)|
| 1:02:17| So, again, I feel like we're kind of, you know, we're doing something that looks good and sounds good to a lot of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3737)|
| 1:02:26| but in actuality it's really not going to do very much for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| Let me just say, Commissioner, several of those severances that, as you said, got people riled up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| did fall within the executive branch and would not happen under this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3754)|
| 1:02:37| Yeah, but not the majority of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| And I also want to say thank you to the trustee for watching today's commission meeting and getting right on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3759)|
| 1:02:48| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| Mr. Chairman, may I ask a question of Mr. Jarrett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| Yes, sir, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3773)|
| 1:02:54| Mr. Jarrett, under the authority of the county mayor, I just want to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| is he able to implement this policy as a part of the policy handbook, the employee handbook today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3779)|
| 1:03:06| waiting on codification at some future date by this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3786)|
| 1:03:10| Yes, that's the way we're structured, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| So the mayor intends to, I mean, this will go into effect immediately, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3794)|
| 1:03:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| The motion is to defer until Monday for one week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| Yes, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| I just wanted, that was a very interesting point you brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| Do we, if the mayor has the authority on his own to put that into the handbook as part of his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| the people that are under him as part of their employment policy, do we need to even be involved in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| This is a question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Well, I mean, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Could he take what we were just handed and put this in the handbook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Yes, he's empowered to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3825)|
| 1:03:47| I believe they were here as a courtesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| I don't want to speak for them, but I believe the commission did ask for them to respond to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| But technically, under the executive powers, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| So do we even need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| So do we even need to put it on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| We don't even need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| I think if I may say just that it would be helpful long-term going forward if it was codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3843)|
| 1:04:10| if it was part of the personnel policies that are, I believe, approved by commission going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3850)|
| 1:04:17| so that this is not something that's decided administration to administration to administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| It would be set as part of the code and the personnel policies so that in the future it would require commission action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3861)|
| 1:04:29| if it were to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3869)|
| 1:04:31| So that's one reason that the mayor wanted to bring it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| Motion is deferred until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3880)|
| 1:04:41| The next item is number 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| It's a resolution regarding Carter Elementary School, Resolution 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| Commissioners, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| I meant to pull that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Obviously, there's an RFP going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| We need to discuss this, so I'd like to withdraw that from the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3890)|
| 1:04:53| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Item 30 is the resolution authorizing the expenditure of $20,000 from the Public Improvement Fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| for renovations to the proposed leased office space on the first floor of the Midway Rehabilitation Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| which the Knox County Drug Court desires to relocate its operations, Resolution 906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3905)|
| 1:05:10| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Yes, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| You know, I really like what Judge Baumgartner and the folks are doing with respect to the drug court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3919)|
| 1:05:29| but I guess I'll go back to the discussion that we had last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3929)|
| 1:05:34| and it disturbs me that I think we're dealing with a slippery slope here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| You know, I'll go back and I'll look at items 15, 14,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| and we see them every month, the ones from the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3945)|
| 1:05:48| All of these 100% funded, 100% funded by the state, 100% federally funded programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3948)|
| 1:05:57| A commission that, you know, not this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| but some commission approved this drug court system based on the fact that it's not going to cost us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3959)|
| 1:06:08| the county taxpayers, any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| And here we are in 2011 asking county taxpayers to pay money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| I know it's not a large sum, but I do think it sets a really bad precedent for these types of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3976)|
| 1:06:24| I mean, normally when those funds, if the health department has a healthy living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3984)|
| 1:06:29| or healthy kid fund and they get $300,000 when those funds run out, we don't take those programs up generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3989)|
| 1:06:37| We don't start, you know, charging the taxpayers for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| And, again, I'm throwing a huge generalization over that unless we feel it's really appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| So I don't know how I'm going to vote on Monday on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| but I do want to just point out that I think this $20,000, I think we blow it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| It was not much money, but we are saying in 2011 that you can do something that you promised us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| that you were not going to do by resolution, you know, at some time in the past, a past county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4024)|
| 1:07:13| Mr. Burrells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| If I remember correctly, we had asked Judge Bumgarner to bring us a fresh, did we get that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4035)|
| 1:07:26| No, I have not seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| I was looking to see if he's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4047)|
| 1:07:28| He's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4048)|
| 1:07:29| Well, I can't vote in favor of this until I see a new estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4049)|
| 1:07:35| So would it be appropriate maybe to defer this for another 30 days until he brings that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4055)|
| 1:07:44| Is that a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4064)|
| 1:07:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4065)|
| 1:07:46| Is there a second to defer for 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| What about if he can get it before Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| What if a substitute motion to defer until Monday and see what he brings to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4070)|
| 1:07:53| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| Okay, then I'll send it without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4077)|
| 1:07:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4078)|
| 1:07:59| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| I just want to make sure that, you know, I think we talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4080)|
| 1:08:03| We were giving them $20,000 so they'd have money to use in case they needed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| and I think they need to come before us with a plan that justifies the need for the $20,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| just to keep them afloat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| You know, the more I thought about it, you know, we're going to give them $5,000 a month rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| There's operating expenses they weren't collecting prior to the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4099)|
| 1:08:22| and so I think we need to be careful that as much as I agree with having the drug court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4102)|
| 1:08:27| you can't just write somebody a check hoping that they don't spend it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| and especially a $20,000 check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| So I think they need to come before us Monday with a plan showing us the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4112)|
| 1:08:36| and justifying that they're going to make that $20,000 back in four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| So that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| Motion is sent on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| The next item is number 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| It's an ordinance amending section 4-3 of the Knox County Code entitled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| Sell a Beer Permit Required to Provide a Procedure to Manage Dormant Beer Permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| This amends Ordinance O-09-3-107 adopted April 27, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| This is Ordinance 101 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4147)|
| 1:09:08| These can't be on consent anyway, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| There's nothing we can do on ordinances today except for discuss, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4152)|
| 1:09:16| Because you can't make a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| So does someone have a recommendation or any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4161)|
| 1:09:24| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4169)|
| 1:09:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4170)|
| 1:09:31| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4172)|
| 1:09:33| Item 32 is an ordinance amending Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 2 of the Knox County Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| entitled Base Personnel Policies by Adding a New Section 2-774 to Preclude Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4177)|
| 1:09:43| from Remitting Severance Payments to Knox County Employees for Work Not Performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| This amends Knox County Code, Chapter 2, Article 10, Division 2 established in Section 2-774,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| This is Ordinance 102 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4193)|
| 1:09:56| Mr. Jarrett, I've asked him to weigh in on this since we just did a resolution on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| Do you want to pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4200)|
| 1:10:01| Do you want to get a motion on the floor prior to the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| I think he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| What is your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| Well, this is the same issue that you've just dealt with, so just restructured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| So I don't see really you need any commission action on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| So are you saying withdraw it or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| That would be my suggestion, but I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| Mr. Smith, this is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Would you like to withdraw it or move it on to Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| Move it to Monday, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| Is there a second to move it to Monday without recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| You know, something just for us to consider while we're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| and it dawned on me while we were listening to Francis and Dean talk about that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4234)|
| 1:10:42| you know, if we do have a situation come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| and this is the reason I brought it up about the severance pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4244)|
| 1:10:47| or some sort of compensation for work not performed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| you really can't look down the road as to what's going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4251)|
| 1:10:54| and what we may need to do and what flexibility that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| that a mayor may need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4258)|
| 1:10:59| If it's a resolution and it's a handbook policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| and they can come back to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| and we can get that part fixed pretty quick if need be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| If it's an ordinance that we need to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| it's going to take a couple of months to get that problem fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4270)|
| 1:11:13| And, you know, for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| I would rather keep that as a handbook issue and as a personnel issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4275)|
| 1:11:19| than I would as an ordinance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4279)|
| 1:11:21| And even though I'm supportive of what the mayor has presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4281)|
| 1:11:28| it does give the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4288)|
| 1:11:31| If he came back here, even if it's in his handbook, it can be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| and then with consultation with the commission we can fix this very quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| if there ever is a situation where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| we need to act and it needs to be over just a short period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4300)|
| 1:11:43| If there are some policies that says we have to wait 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4303)|
| 1:11:47| first of all you're going to have to change the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| which is going to take a couple of months to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| then another 90 days to implement it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4311)|
| 1:11:53| You know, that really takes away a lot of the flexibility that we may need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4313)|
| 1:11:58| if we're running into a budget crisis or a personnel crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| And for that reason, I would prefer not to codify it in terms of an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4321)|
| 1:12:07| but just to leave it as a resolution, which does carry some weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| but it allows the flexibility that we wouldn't have with an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4331)|
| 1:12:14| That's just something I wanted to throw out there for us to consider over the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4334)|
| 1:12:19| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4339)|
| 1:12:20| The motion then is to send it on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4346)|
| 1:12:27| We're on page 7, item 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4347)|
| 1:12:28| It's an ordinance amending Article 2, Article 3, and Article 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| of the Knox County Zoning Ordinance regarding side yard setbacks on corner lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| This amends Ordinance 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| This is Ordinance 103 on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4364)|
| 1:12:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4366)|
| 1:12:47| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| Commissioner Owenby, your light is on, but these lights are very sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| Any discussion at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4377)|
| 1:12:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4378)|
| 1:12:59| Yes, I'd like to ask Roy Braden to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| There he is in back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4383)|
| 1:13:04| I'd like to ask Roy Braden to come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| We had some discussion on this, and he and I had decided among ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4386)|
| 1:13:13| that the best option would be to go with the county zoning ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| on those that were not controlled by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| It's not listed on here, but is that what actually went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| and came out of MPC, Roy, the figures that you and I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4407)|
| 1:13:31| on the back yard setback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4411)|
| 1:13:33| Roy Braden, 400 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Yes, it was changed a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4416)|
| 1:13:41| but what the amendment is saying is what we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| It actually did point it back to the previous regulations, which is acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| and it's just the way it was worded in my interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| and our department's interpretation, it's what we really wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4435)|
| 1:14:00| So it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| One of those was cut down, though, was it not, from what you and I talked about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4442)|
| 1:14:07| I can't remember which measurement it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| Well, they had increased the side or rear setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| from what it would be at 5 or 8 feet to 8 or 10 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4454)|
| 1:14:19| but then Mark Donaldson with MPC, they did change that to point it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| to the existing side and rear setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| So it was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| At first they had put in the table that changed all the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Well, he took that out, and then in his definitions in the section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| he said that all buildings would meet the peripheral boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| versus now a pool was defined as a structure instead of a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| so it said that structures did not have to meet the peripheral boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| So they did change those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| I thought I had those figures with me, but I don't have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| I'm going to make a substitute motion that if we have a motion, we do have a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| that we defer this till Monday because there's one measurement I want to check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| that I'm not sure is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4509)|
| 1:15:11| I'd like to propose we defer it till Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4520)|
| 1:15:24| Okay, so this will not be on consent anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| so we'll just go ahead and move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4526)|
| 1:15:29| Okay, we'll move it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4531)|
| 1:15:34| Not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| The next item before we start the discussion items is Resolution 302,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| which was added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| It is approving Amendment 1 to the three-year grant agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| with the Tennessee Board of Probation and Parole for the Knox County Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| Community Alternatives to Prison Program to increase the maximum liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4550)|
| 1:15:54| of the state under the contract by $136,500 for the purpose of hiring a new case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4554)|
| 1:16:01| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4564)|
| 1:16:05| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4568)|
| 1:16:09| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4569)|
| 1:16:11| Item 35 is discussion regarding Commission's responsibility as it pertains to Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4571)|
| 1:16:17| Commissioners, in looking at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4577)|
| 1:16:19| you had asked me at the conclusion of our meeting last time to begin looking into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4579)|
| 1:16:23| and the more I looked into it, the more I became aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| I became more aware of the fact that we need to have a Sector Plan 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4586)|
| 1:16:30| So I'm recommending to you that at our Chairman's Luncheon on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4590)|
| 1:16:35| I have asked Mr. Donaldson to come and to explain to us our responsibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| explain to us any options that we may have as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| I've also asked Mr. Jarrett to address the legal issues that we're involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4603)|
| 1:16:47| because we've never been here before as a commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| We're plowing new ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| So my goal is to provide you with the information that you need to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| And so that's what I'm suggesting is that we have as our Commission Luncheon on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4617)|
| 1:17:02| Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Jarrett to come and address you, give you the opportunity to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| and that will have the entire hour that we have for the Commissioner's Luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4626)|
| 1:17:11| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| Can we extend an invitation to the public to be at that luncheon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4632)|
| 1:17:19| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4639)|
| 1:17:20| I mean, I know that we always sunshine these luncheons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| but I think this is a topic that would be very interesting to a pretty good number of people in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4644)|
| 1:17:32| So I would like to make sure that we really get the word out about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| and let them know that they're welcome to come and listen to this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4655)|
| 1:17:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| We can do it either in the small assembly room or we can move into the large assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| You said that so we would have the information so we could make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| What are we making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4668)|
| 1:17:49| We will not make a decision on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| What are we making a decision on, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| Mr. Jarrett, do you want to explain the responsibility of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| Well, in a nutshell, Commissioners, because you are actually the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| you are now tasked with crafting a legally defensible plan to send back to MPC for their review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4681)|
| 1:18:09| We thought it would be helpful to actually go through the mechanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| and the evolving law that's involved in that process because it's not as simple as merely the status quo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4692)|
| 1:18:18| You've got competing interests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| You've got people with a property right interest, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| So we just thought it would be helpful for the Commission to actually ensure they have the tools necessary to craft a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4702)|
| 1:18:30| because you've never been asked to do that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| I guess really what I want to make clear is that we're not deciding what to do with the property midway because we don't own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| This is just what Commission's responsibility is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| And as I say, as I delved into it, it was a little bit more complicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4721)|
| 1:18:45| and I felt that all of us needed to be aware of what our responsibilities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4725)|
| 1:18:49| And so that's why I asked Mr. Donaldson and Mr. Jarrett to come give us a briefing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| give you the opportunity to ask any questions as we move forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| So that will be at 1130, and, of course, anyone is welcome to come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| and we'll accommodate anyone who comes except for food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| Okay, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| The next item is number 36, discussion regarding Knox County's false alarm policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4749)|
| 1:19:16| Mr. Schatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4757)|
| 1:19:18| I put this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4758)|
| 1:19:19| I had a couple of calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4759)|
| 1:19:20| Most of the publicity about the false alarms recently have been situations inside the city limits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| which wouldn't really pertain to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| But I was asked what our policy was, and I didn't know, and I had another gentleman call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| and he alleges a false alarm in his neighborhood, a burglar alarm, went off for 40 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| Whether that's true or not, maybe he'll come and tell us next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| But I just wanted to put this on the agenda and focus a little attention on it Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| and I'll have a little more background to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| Any questions for Mr. Schatz or any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4788)|
| 1:19:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| Item 37 is tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Item 38, discussion regarding alcohol use in Knox County-funded 10-year plan housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4796)|
| 1:20:02| Mr. Wanby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| Yes, I'm going to talk now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4804)|
| 1:20:07| Save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| I've been saving my voice this whole time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4808)|
| 1:20:12| I apologize if my voice does crack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| This was brought up a few months ago when I asked the question to the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| what the mayor's stance was on alcohol in the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| because I've had, during the whole campaign cycle, every door I knocked on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| as well as after that, the many phone calls and people that have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4830)|
| 1:20:35| their displeasure that there is no policy on no alcohol being allowed in these premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4835)|
| 1:20:43| I have talked to the 10-year plan people and John Lawler and his group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4843)|
| 1:20:50| and they said that there would not be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4850)|
| 1:20:56| That's the reason I bring this up is that a lot of money is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| and we say it's only $50,000 that we're giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| but they've already came out and said earlier this month that $600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| is what they're going to ask for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| So at what point does it stop that the citizens don't finally get a say on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4871)|
| 1:21:17| how these programs are going to be ran?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4877)|
| 1:21:22| Yeah, I know that it was set up in 2005 with the 4th and Gill neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4882)|
| 1:21:30| and other organizations that were in on planning this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| but the whole county was not involved in all that planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4894)|
| 1:21:38| I've been to all these informational meetings out here in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| south Knoxville as well as down west and over in east Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| and their statement is just not on alcohol but on everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4910)|
| 1:21:55| has changed from every single meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| It depends on who you talk to of where their stance is on certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4919)|
| 1:22:04| I just feel very strongly, and the citizens that talk to me feel very strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4924)|
| 1:22:11| that if they're going to be giving up money that they should have a say on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4931)|
| 1:22:14| how these programs are ran and developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4934)|
| 1:22:19| I'm very much opposed to alcohol being allowed in Menville and Flinningham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4939)|
| 1:22:27| when it finally opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| Dealing with alcoholics that are in my family, having it around them, next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4950)|
| 1:22:39| they're going to smell it, they're going to be around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| they're never going to get any help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| If we're serious about helping the homeless, we've got to have programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| we've got to have programs like Haven for Hope, which is in San Antonio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4967)|
| 1:22:54| No alcohol is allowed in their premises at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| They have programs set up to help the homeless, to make them productive in society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4977)|
| 1:23:03| There's another one, Room at the Inn, which is in Nashville, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| These are ran by the public, by organizations like CARM and Salvation Army| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4988)|
| 1:23:14| and churches that get in here to help the homeless, to make them productive in society| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=4994)|
| 1:23:20| and to get them the help that they need and the services that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5000)|
| 1:23:26| Us allowing alcohol, I'm just strongly opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5006)|
| 1:23:31| That's the reason I brought it up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| From all indications that I've gotten from Mr. Lawler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5016)|
| 1:23:39| and I don't know if his group is here or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| but every indication I've got from them is that they do not plan on changing their policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5023)|
| 1:23:48| And I don't really know how to draft the motion or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5028)|
| 1:23:54| but I'm in favor of withdrawing all funding to the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5034)|
| 1:24:01| until they're willing to at least come to the table and discuss a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| I'm not saying a zero tolerance and you get caught with alcohol, you're gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5046)|
| 1:24:11| but there needs to be some kind of policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| There needs to be something that the homeless can meet us halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| That's all I'm asking for is for them to meet us halfway if we're willing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| The citizens are willing to do these projects and services and help them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5062)|
| 1:24:29| that the least they could do is meet us halfway in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| So I guess I make a motion that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| This is just discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| But, Commissioner, if you want to draft a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| the law director can help you do that so you can get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5090)|
| 1:24:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| On most of Commissioner Ornby's points, I agree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| but we can't always have what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5097)|
| 1:25:01| When Uncle Whiskers sends down money, 99.9% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| he puts a lot of little strings dangling onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| And this is one of those cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Now, a lot of you know Steve Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5113)|
| 1:25:16| Anybody know Steve Martin, Leadership Foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| That's behind all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| He does all his movies anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| I had a discussion with him last week regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5126)|
| 1:25:29| They're in the process right now, Commissioner Ornby, of researching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| They're expecting a decision back hopefully within the next 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| certainly within the next 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| It might behoove us to wait to see what that decision is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| because right now federal guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| you could not legally take it away from them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| since they're getting federal money to go in those places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| Now, I agree there needs to be some constraints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| and some rules and regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| but what they're waiting on with Northern Leadership Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| they're the ones behind Flanagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| He's the guy who writes the checks, Steve Martin is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5170)|
| 1:26:17| But what they're waiting on is to get that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| and opinion from the federal government on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| Right now, according to Ginny Weatherstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| I'm not sure about Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| We didn't get that far that day we were over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| but I know when it went on Jackson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| they were allowed to have alcohol in the rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5192)|
| 1:26:35| They couldn't have it in the halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| So we live in an age today, some of us don't like, a lot of us don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5198)|
| 1:26:46| that nothing today and almost nothing today is either all black or all white.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5206)|
| 1:26:51| There has to be some gray along the way to make things move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| and I think we're not ready to find that gray part yet on this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| because we don't have enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| what the federal things are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| So my recommendation, I would say we don't need to forget about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5228)|
| 1:27:14| but we need to wait until we get that federal information before we do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| I think that there needs to be some more studying done on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5243)|
| 1:27:34| It seems to me that there are some folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5254)|
| 1:27:41| who really don't understand how permanent supportive housing with the 10-year plan works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| I would like to recommend that we as a commission have a workshop on exactly how this works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| because I feel like there are some really major misunderstandings on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5275)|
| 1:28:02| and we all need to be educated a little bit better on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| CMC has operated permanent supportive housing for the last 19 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5288)|
| 1:28:13| They have never had a no-alcohol policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| but they have incredible success in keeping people housed and in getting people to help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5299)|
| 1:28:29| and the people who are moving into these units are meeting us halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5309)|
| 1:28:35| A lot of them are meeting us more than halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| You can't get into one of these facilities unless you've already done considerable work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| and made considerable progress on your problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5326)|
| 1:28:51| And I've got a statement here from a letter that Jenny Weatherstone sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5331)|
| 1:28:58| to the supporters of Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5338)|
| 1:29:03| and I'm going to post it in its entirety on the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5343)|
| 1:29:06| because it has a lot of really good information pertaining to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5346)|
| 1:29:10| And one is that it's important to understand just what Menvilla Manor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| It's just like the Jackson Apartments that they had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| It's permanent supportive housing, and it means that the people in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5359)|
| 1:29:23| they recognize that they have problems and they're committed to getting help with their problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5363)|
| 1:29:27| and they agree to work with the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| To gain admission to Menvilla, there are strict requirements, personal accountability among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5370)|
| 1:29:39| And although BMC is strongly committed to recovery, Menvilla Manor is not a rehab facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5379)|
| 1:29:47| Jackson Apartments weren't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| The majority of residents at Menvilla are not alcoholics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5391)|
| 1:29:55| Several of them are employed, and they're working on issues that do not involve alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| I also am going to assume, since there is a problem with alcohol in 10-year plan supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5401)|
| 1:30:11| that there's also going to be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| and this will be addressed about alcohol in our KCDC Section 8 and low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5415)|
| 1:30:28| There's about 7,200 KCDC subsidized housing units in our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5428)|
| 1:30:36| and that's way more than the 10-year plan is ever going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5436)|
| 1:30:41| There's not a no-alcohol policy, and those are taxpayer-funded vouchers and housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5441)|
| 1:30:48| So if there's a policy problem that somebody's having with the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5448)|
| 1:30:54| then it's also going to be a policy problem across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5454)|
| 1:31:00| I don't think it's fair to single out one program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5460)|
| 1:31:06| Again, everyone needs to be treated fairly and equitably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| To treat the 10-year plan one way and then not these other 7,200 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| that are public taxpayer money supported tells me that alcohol in housing is not the real issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5478)|
| 1:31:30| So this is something that I take very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5490)|
| 1:31:35| We have a tremendously successful program in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5495)|
| 1:31:39| Haven of Hope cost millions and millions more than we'll ever put in to the TYP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5499)|
| 1:31:48| and its success rate is half of what ours is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| And no, they don't let alcohol in, and that cuts the number of people they can help considerably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5514)|
| 1:32:03| I'm not in favor of leaving anybody out in the cold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| So I think I'm going to be posting quite a bit of information on the forum related to this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| and I think it's something that we need to really get in there and do some serious homework on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5533)|
| 1:32:20| So I would like to ask the chairman to please schedule a workshop for us on this specific issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5540)|
| 1:32:31| I will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| Before we hear from other commissioners, Mr. Jarrett wants to weigh in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| Just one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| There's a multitude of legal issues involved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| I've been researching this since this first started appearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| and I've learned recently that so is the city law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5565)|
| 1:32:49| So we're going to have to make it distinguished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5569)|
| 1:32:52| For instance, if you're taking, say, HUD dollars, HUD has certain terms and conditions of their grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5572)|
| 1:32:58| you can't add to or take away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| However, federal law mandates that if you're getting Section 8 housing dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5580)|
| 1:33:04| and you commit an alcohol-related offense, you're evicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5584)|
| 1:33:08| So my point is there are some legal issues here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5588)|
| 1:33:12| and they're kind of thorny because our federal courts have been consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5592)|
| 1:33:18| in terms of really how far you can regulate a legal substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| So as much as I usually have a habit of volunteering for more work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| I think this is one of those times I have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| I think I should be given a little bit of time to more fully research this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5610)|
| 1:33:35| I've already conferred with a HUD attorney in D.C. who does a lot of the HUD grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5615)|
| 1:33:40| I'm looking at some of her research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| I'd just throw that out as an option to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| This is going to be part of our workshop is give him an opportunity to look into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| so we can be fully briefed on it, but we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| Commissioner Andrews?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| I think it's important that most of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| obviously I was against spending $6 million on Menville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| because I thought it was investing more money than the worth of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| It had nothing to do with the program that was going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| I think this is a good time in the next year with the city getting a new mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5649)|
| 1:34:12| the county having a new mayor, to reevaluate the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5652)|
| 1:34:17| not per se throw it away, not per se fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5657)|
| 1:34:22| completely fund everything they ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| But I think what we need to do is separate the providers from the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| You speak of Menville and VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5671)|
| 1:34:35| In my opinion, if a provider does not require accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| and they have no record of accountability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| I think the 10-year plan should not fund them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| I think if they want to seek private funds, seek church funds, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5684)|
| 1:34:49| The Salvation Army has operated Operation Bootstrap for as long as I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5689)|
| 1:34:56| It's privately funded, no federal dollars as far as I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| They take a breathalyzer when they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| They pay a weekly rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| They work eight hours in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| They work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| The Salvation Army provides their meals as they go to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5708)|
| 1:35:11| They provide them transportation to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5711)|
| 1:35:13| VMC, if you don't participate in cleaning up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| you don't participate with your case manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| you don't participate with your programs, your addictions, your issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| you're out of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| And so I think we need to separate the 10-year plan from the providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5724)|
| 1:35:30| because the 10-year plan that everybody's against is the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5730)|
| 1:35:33| They're not against the providers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| The housing spending $6 million on 157 units is what gets the bird in the saddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5735)|
| 1:35:42| Spending, you know, when we have empty apartments other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| and we can do things other places instead of building new buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5745)|
| 1:35:50| is what gets everybody mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| But I think now is a great time in the next year to reevaluate the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| the participation, the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| If you're not going to hold people accountable, then you're not getting any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| And that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5762)|
| 1:36:06| But I think it's important to, when you say Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5766)|
| 1:36:11| and what you've got to understand, once a person becomes a resident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| I mean when they were a resident of Jackson or Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| they were under a Section 8 voucher, and that's how they were getting their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5777)|
| 1:36:22| And you cannot regulate the groceries they take into that house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| no more than you can regulate the groceries that somebody takes into a regular residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5786)|
| 1:36:32| that just so happens to have a Section 8 voucher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| VMC has a strong, strong behavioral policy and eviction rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| If you don't participate in a congenial manner, you're out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5800)|
| 1:36:48| and you have no other options probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| So I think it's important that we take time to separate the mission from each provider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5810)|
| 1:36:55| the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Now there's 10 points to the 10-year plan that most people only know one of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5817)|
| 1:37:01| So I think it's important that you study the plan before you speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| and understand that the providers that don't hold people accountable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| shouldn't be funded through county or city or federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| That's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| I agree with Commissioner Anders on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| If a provider is not following the doing what they said they were going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5840)|
| 1:37:29| then they shouldn't receive funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| And I also think that we should even go further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| and say that if they are not cooperating, each agency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| when the 10-year plan came together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| each agency said they would be responsible for a certain portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5860)|
| 1:37:44| And I think that if those agencies are not holding up their end of the bargain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5864)|
| 1:37:51| in terms of what they're supposed to be doing, then they don't get funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| I believe that very strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I also want to make a point, as you did, Brad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| that VMC has strict rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5882)|
| 1:38:08| You cannot live in VMC housing unless you have personal accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5888)|
| 1:38:17| And, again, this goes back to not really understanding the 10-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5897)|
| 1:38:22| or how permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| These individuals have already agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| They have already stepped up, and they are meeting us halfway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| And they do have to show some personal accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5915)|
| 1:38:40| And I just think that, and you're right, there are 10 sections to the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5920)|
| 1:38:46| and I don't think it's so much the money that I think the money is the excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| Nobody wants permanent supportive housing in their neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5933)|
| 1:38:56| and that's the real issue, and that's what we're going to have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| There was a lot of money put into MinnVilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| and the only reason I agreed to it was because it was saving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| that beautiful historic building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5947)|
| 1:39:09| But I'm certainly not in favor of laying out that kind of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| for any future developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| That was a one-time thing, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| But I think what the real issue is is not how much this costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5960)|
| 1:39:25| but where it's going to be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5965)|
| 1:39:27| And I think that we need to be real honest and real clear about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5967)|
| 1:39:31| and have a discussion on how that can be handled equitably as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5971)|
| 1:39:38| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5980)|
| 1:39:42| The next item is 39.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5982)|
| 1:39:44| It's line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5987)|
| 1:39:48| I had a question about something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5988)|
| 1:39:49| Can I get a second on the line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5991)|
| 1:39:52| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5992)|
| 1:39:53| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5993)|
| 1:39:54| I had a question on the public libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| Dean, was that budgeted, this $10,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| Was that in the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6000)|
| 1:40:05| If you could just check on that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| Then on page six there, Doug, on the parks that you've got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| and you said the golf courses, you've got some $18,339 golf courses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| self-supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6016)|
| 1:40:18| Is it going to self-support itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| You do a good job with your budget, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| Any other comments on line item transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| The next item that was added was discussion regarding the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| Commissioner Brown, those were your items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6038)|
| 1:40:40| Yes, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6040)|
| 1:40:44| Toward my microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| A couple of months ago I brought to the commission about a product called 4 Loco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6047)|
| 1:40:56| It's the equivalent of three-and-a-half drinks plus caffeine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6056)|
| 1:41:02| If you've been following the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| you've seen that the federal government has made them quit putting the caffeine in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| so it is now back to still a three-and-a-half drink in a can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6069)|
| 1:41:19| My concern here is that at our Metropolitan Drug Commission meeting today it was brought up that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6079)|
| 1:41:28| that's not the only drink out there with these energy drinks with alcohol in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6088)|
| 1:41:34| Of course, I'm sure that our beer inspector is aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| I've asked for a list of all of those because whenever you go into an establishment to buy one of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6100)|
| 1:41:47| how does the clerk know to charge you or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| I mean, it's becoming a real, real problem, so I think we need to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| The second thing is that coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6115)|
| 1:42:01| Attorney General Randy Nichols brought up the fact that in this session in the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6121)|
| 1:42:06| it's going to be a very hotly debated issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| the fact that putting a connection to the computers between the pharmacies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6131)|
| 1:42:19| so that we can track who's abusing the prescription drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6139)|
| 1:42:24| One lady gave an example there of one woman who went to—where's JJ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| Was it—23 doctors and got 58 different prescriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6149)|
| 1:42:35| They're also flying to Florida on—what do they call that, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| Fly down one day and load up on this prescription and bring back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6160)|
| 1:42:44| But we can control it in the state if we all get behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| where that if you go to more than one drugstore, and this will be real time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6168)|
| 1:42:54| where that if you go to CVS and Farragut and get a prescription| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6174)|
| 1:42:58| and you go out to South Knoxville and get the same—you've got a duplicate prescription for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| and get it the same day, it's going to show up on a computer and be a red flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| This is something that I would like to see the commission write a supporting letter to our new governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6188)|
| 1:43:15| that when this does come across his desk that he would support it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| because there's millions of dollars already being given to the lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6198)|
| 1:43:22| The drug companies have already hired the most prominent lobbyist in Nashville to try to defeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6202)|
| 1:43:29| So I would like to see us do something to say we support that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| that we can keep track of these and who's getting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6214)|
| 1:43:38| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6218)|
| 1:43:40| I really don't have—that's already being done on the drugstores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| No, we're not controlling the interstate commerce part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6222)|
| 1:43:46| But, I mean, I can look up—if I want to know if somebody's getting a narcotic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| I can look it up and find out if they've gotten it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| As a matter of fact, I'm obligated to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| That's not what they gave us this morning, so I need to get with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6238)|
| 1:44:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| Mr. Brown, on the energy drinks, if you'd like to draft a letter and bring it to us on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| we could take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6248)|
| 1:44:09| You could get with Jolie and draft that, and we could take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| and perhaps send it on to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| So if you would like to do that and present it to us Monday, we can add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| Any other comments on this before we—we need to go to Commissioner Norman in the ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6256)|
| 1:44:21| So, Commissioner Norman, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6261)|
| 1:44:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| Given probably the length of this, I think maybe it would be appropriate for us to have a little break| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6265)|
| 1:44:31| and then come back to it if that's agreeable to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6271)|
| 1:44:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| We'll take ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| We'll take a ten-minute break and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6279)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110118?start=6308)|
