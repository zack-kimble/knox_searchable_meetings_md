| 0:01:01| Commissioner Jay. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=61)|
| 0:01:03| Commissioner Biggs. Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=63)|
| 0:01:04| Team members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| We only have one item for discussion at this meeting and solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=68)|
| 0:01:13| and that is the appointment of a commissioner to fill Commissioner Schoonmaker's role on the Knox County Pension and Retirement Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=73)|
| 0:01:24| I recall at a prior meeting Commissioner Schoonmaker had said that at this meeting he wanted to be able to address commission about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=84)|
| 0:01:34| So I'd like to, if it's okay with Commissioner Schoonmaker, to go ahead and turn it over to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=94)|
| 0:01:40| Though I don't see a light, I'm guessing that you would like to address commission on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=100)|
| 0:01:45| If you so wish, I'll be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=105)|
| 0:01:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=107)|
| 0:01:48| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=108)|
| 0:01:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=109)|
| 0:01:52| And, again, that many of you may have seen my resignation letter to the pension board, and it was very brief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=112)|
| 0:02:01| and I was basically following the protocol that was established when the registrar of deeds resigned from the pension board prior to his term expiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=121)|
| 0:02:11| So that's why it was just kind of a one-line sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=131)|
| 0:02:17| But I've served on the Retirement and Pension Board for a little over two years with perfect attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| and I felt it was an opportunity now for somebody else to fill that need on the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=145)|
| 0:02:33| And as I explained when I talked to Chairman Nystrom and also the chairman of the Retirement and Pension Board, Chris Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=153)|
| 0:02:42| when I gave my resignation letter, that there was a potential of a new opportunity opening up for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=162)|
| 0:02:49| and that the time commitment was going to be a lot greater than I had had in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| And so that's why I was stepping down from the Retirement and Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=175)|
| 0:03:02| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| I guess what I'd like to do is have a little bit of discussion about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| I want to let you know we just wrapped up a meeting of the Knox County Pension and Retirement Board's Investment Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=191)|
| 0:03:18| During that meeting, or excuse me, after the meeting, Nick McBride, who is a former chair of that committee, no longer serves on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=198)|
| 0:03:26| mentioned to me how important this position is on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| And just as we move forward, he shared with me how we've got a lot of folks who are serving on that board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=211)|
| 0:03:38| with around two years of experience and some less, and that it was a very important appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| and that we do our best to make sure with that particular committee that we have long-term kind of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=226)|
| 0:03:54| who can give some stability as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=234)|
| 0:03:58| And he mentioned, I guess Nick McBride served on that committee for quite some time, and I know he was a former chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| and he had mentioned that we want to be looking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=244)|
| 0:04:07| are there ways you can get folks to serve on it for a long period of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| And I told him that I would bring up his concerns to the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=251)|
| 0:04:17| One thing he had also mentioned was, you know, to consider whoever is appointed to in the eighth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| because that person could potentially serve for eight to ten years if they were on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| So just out of respect for Nick McBride, I wanted to make sure I brought that to you all's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=267)|
| 0:04:32| So moving forward, is there any other discussion around this matter that any of the commissioners would like to add in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=272)|
| 0:04:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Seeing none, I'd like to open up the floor for nominations for this particular seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=284)|
| 0:05:01| The chair recognizes Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| I've thought long and hard about this, and I have four years left in my term, so I'd like to nominate myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| The chair recognizes that Commissioner Smith has self-nominated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=314)|
| 0:05:19| Are there any other nominations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| I think Randy will make a great one, but I was going to nominate Commissioner Busler, if he would excel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=323)|
| 0:05:31| But, Randy, you'd make a great one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=333)|
| 0:05:34| You know the numbers and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| Well, then I'd like to ask that nominations cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| There's a recommendation or a motion to cease nominations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=348)|
| 0:05:51| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Is there another line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=353)|
| 0:05:54| Did you nominate Busler or did he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=355)|
| 0:05:56| He's got to accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=356)|
| 0:05:57| I nominate him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=359)|
| 0:06:00| Okay, I'll accept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=360)|
| 0:06:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=363)|
| 0:06:04| Commissioner Busler accepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| So the chair recognizes that there are two nominations on the floor, Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| I'll second Michelle's nomination to cease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=373)|

| 0:06:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| All opposed, please say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=381)|
| 0:06:22| I want to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=382)|
| 0:06:23| Is this something we'll need to do a roll call vote on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=383)|

| 0:06:36| If I know how he's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| In keeping with how I've been rotating the roll call votes, this will be a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| And Commissioner Smith, you're due for the first vote on this roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom181113SpecialCalled?start=403)|
