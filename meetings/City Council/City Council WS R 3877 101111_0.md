| 0:11:13| These properties, this individual has been sued in four separate tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| And what often happens is that somebody, we start the tax sale process at our Revenue Collections Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=679)|
| 0:11:26| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Let's just move forward to these pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| There we go, there's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Go ahead to the second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| Property owners sued for property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| and then through that process they often will pay before it actually gets taken to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| And so they pay enough to stop the tax sale and then start the process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=706)|
| 0:11:52| And the way the law is structured, people can get away with that currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| So this property owner is often in arrears and taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=720)|
| 0:12:03| though ironically the owner has some nearby commercial parcels that they tend to keep current on their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=723)|
| 0:12:11| but these residential properties are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| We have a $4,600 lien for the demolition of one of these properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| one of its other properties at 102 Tillery Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| and a $200 lien for lot cleanup at a Renwick address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| It's currently on the list to be mowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=747)|
| 0:12:29| So this is a good example of the challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| Here are properties that are boarded and secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| They aren't burned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| They didn't go through a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| They're structurally sound, so technically they can't go to the Better Building Board for demolition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| However, there's 145 computer entries with his name attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| A few are related to permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| The majority are dirty lot and structure complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| It's continually overgrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| It's definitely a blinding influence to the neighborhood that brings down other property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| So when it's an extreme problem, like there's been a fire, and it's not structurally sound,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=781)|
| 0:13:07| then codes has more power at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| So we're going to talk about some solutions later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=791)|
| 0:13:15| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| Okay, here are two examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=796)|
| 0:13:18| So that was north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| We're actually going to cover properties north, south, east, and west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| That was in North Knoxville and Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=801)|
| 0:13:24| Here are two different lots in east Knoxville, different owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Different owners from the previous slides, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| This is an example of a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=811)|
| 0:13:33| On the top slide, here's something that's been abandoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=813)|
| 0:13:37| It's boarded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=817)|
| 0:13:39| It's actually there are trustees that are listed as owners of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=819)|
| 0:13:44| I'm not sure if the actual owner has died.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=824)|
| 0:13:49| Often you have the problem that the owners die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=829)|
| 0:13:51| The heirs may not be located or there may be multiple heirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| There's an uninsurable title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| It's very difficult for the private sector to do much about the properties when they get in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=837)|
| 0:14:03| The bottom picture is an example of another property owner where the city tore the house down eight years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=843)|
| 0:14:11| And so, you know, they did use the codes enforcement powers to do that to demolish a bad structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=851)|
| 0:14:20| but the result is often this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| It's no other action is taken by the property owner, and the city ends up having to go out there and mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=862)|
| 0:14:32| This house also has liens for the demolition and for the lot cleanup, and we continue to mow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=872)|
| 0:14:37| It's currently on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=877)|
| 0:14:41| Here's an example west off of on Pine Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| This is an apartment complex that shows you it's not just in our inner core neighborhoods where this is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| This was condemned in 2003, and it has many expired permits attached to the complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| There are no lot liens or complaints, actually, to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| It's fenced, so it's relatively secured, and that resulted in 911 calls going down because of the fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| The buildings are structurally sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| It's for sale, but it's still a blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=911)|
| 0:15:17| In South Knoxville, just a block or so from where I live is Old South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=917)|
| 0:15:23| This is a problem that you all, I know Councilman Pavlis is aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Here's a problem that our friends in the county have had to grapple with because, and now the city, through codes enforcement, is dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=928)|
| 0:15:37| The county originally did an RFP for the redevelopment of this when it was surplus by the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=937)|
| 0:15:43| A developer was selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| However, a county commission rejected the price that the developer was going to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| and instead insisted that there be a surplus auction, which means that you have the auction and the highest bidder comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=951)|
| 0:15:59| And so a highest bidder showed up, but then that person ended up not having the resources to complete the renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=959)|
| 0:16:06| He partially re-roofed it but appears to have walked away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| The lot is overgrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| The ceilings are collapsing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=971)|
| 0:16:13| It's vacant and unsecured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=973)|
| 0:16:15| Just this past, in October, the codes took it to the Better Building Board, and it was ordered secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=975)|
| 0:16:22| And if the owner doesn't secure the property, then he'll get a bill of probably several thousand dollars from public service for having to secure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=982)|
| 0:16:33| There are seven dirty and overgrown lot complaints since February of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| There's tax liens and mowing bills, you know, for mowing and cleaning the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| So this is a good example of why appropriate disposition is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| Often these properties, if they just go to surplus, they're not going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| we don't have the safeguards in place that the purchaser has the resources to redevelop them properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1012)|
| 0:16:59| There's no clawback provision like you can have when you have an RFP and have a redevelopment agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1019)|
| 0:17:09| You all know that these large public buildings are especially difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| and we have to find ways to incentivize the development to get it back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1032)|
| 0:17:18| and make it an asset to the neighborhood rather than a blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| The good news is that North Knoxville has the Oakwood School, which is a similar situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| It's a blight on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| But right now an RFP is out on the street for redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| and I know the county commission has voted for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| So we look forward to, hopefully there will be a good resolution for Oakwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| and hopefully we can find a good resolution for Eagle South High in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1063)|
| 0:17:51| Okay, so now we want to talk, so that's just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| I think I see it. We don't need to do much more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| People in this room are well aware of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| Recently, when we pulled our committee together, we started looking at trying to actually map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1081)|
| 0:18:08| and quantify the number of vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1088)|
| 0:18:13| It's tough to do, and I'm sorry this map doesn't show up well on the big screen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1093)|
| 0:18:18| but this first one shows the distribution of vacant parcels in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| along with the distribution of blighted and nuisance properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| And Tim Coon, an MPC who did this, can tell you the difficulty in pulling this data together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1108)|
| 0:18:36| You have to use a variety of different databases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| They don't all match. The addresses don't match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| It's a tough job to pull it together, but this was our sort of best shot at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1122)|
| 0:18:50| the time that we did it back in the past year, or a year ago, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| What this shows, though, is within the city, there are about 8,900 vacant parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1135)|
| 0:19:02| 8,200 of those are smaller than two-acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1142)|
| 0:19:09| So a lot of them are right in the core.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1149)|
| 0:19:11| And a lot of them are not buildable because they're very small lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| There are about 707 properties on there that are considered nuisance structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| nuisance lots, and potentially blighted structures or blighted lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| Bottom line, there's a lot of them, and you can see where they're distributed across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1168)|
| 0:19:37| They're all over the city, but there's a big swath kind of from west to east, as you can see, in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1177)|
| 0:19:45| The second map shows the properties that were taken to tax sale over the past 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1185)|
| 0:19:54| There are a total of about 824 properties that either the city or the county took to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1194)|
| 0:20:02| And these are properties in the city that either the city or the county took to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1202)|
| 0:20:08| Also on those, and, again, you can't really tell well from the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1208)|
| 0:20:15| it also indicates the properties that are three or more years delinquent on taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1215)|
| 0:20:22| And so currently this number, at least at the time of this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| there were about 2,600 properties with $7.2 million in taxes that were due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| The good news is that ultimately only about 1% of property owners get to the three years or more delinquent in taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1231)|
| 0:20:41| but you can see that 1% can make a significant difference in these neighborhoods where they're located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1241)|
| 0:20:50| Okay, so that's showing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| We've showed you just some pictures of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| We showed you some stats about it and where it's distributed through the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1254)|
| 0:20:59| Now we want to talk about some of the current tools that we have in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| among our various departments that are involved in addressing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| We're going to briefly go over prevention and enforcement, powers that we have to gain control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| and then some strategies for reuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1275)|
| 0:21:23| As far as prevention and enforcement, the first, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| strategy to try and prevent properties from becoming blighted is through the housing programs that we offer in community development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1287)|
| 0:21:34| City Council is well aware of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| You approve our annual plan every year, which involves funding, primarily federal funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| for our owner-occupied rehabs and some rental rehabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| It's a combination of loans and partial grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| We have commercial façade programs and the My Front Yard program, which is a residential façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| We also had, with the EZ funds, we had a million or more dollars in the EZ blighted property redevelopment program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1316)|
| 0:22:05| This was a development loan that a lot of folks cannot redevelop their blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| because they can't get banks to lend them any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| So we front the money, we give them a development loan, they fix it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| then they sell it or get a permanent mortgage and they pay us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1337)|
| 0:22:21| And we'll show you a few pictures of that in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| Another tool that we have is our redevelopment areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| You all, with KCDC, when you approve a geographical area as a redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1350)|
| 0:22:39| KCDC works with us and develops a plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| And that's a way that we can look at ways of using various different tools to revitalize that particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1365)|
| 0:22:54| We also have the Chronic Problem Properties Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| This is an interdepartmental committee in the city with many of our departments around the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1378)|
| 0:23:03| Our job on this committee is to target sort of the worst of the worst of the chronic problem properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1383)|
| 0:23:12| the ones that aren't in the redevelopment areas, and first we try to mitigate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| Our staff goes out there as well as the other city staff from various departments to talk with the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1397)|
| 0:23:25| to try and work with them to come up with solutions to encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1405)|
| 0:23:29| and to use whatever enforcement measures we have to try and mitigate the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| There's also zoning enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| Zoning enforcement deals with things like parking in front yards, illegal businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1421)|
| 0:23:47| and can be preventive in that violations like these exert a blighting influence on the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1427)|
| 0:23:56| Of course, KPV, they are dealing with crime and vandalism, prostitution and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| which tend to congregate around these vacant and blighted properties and lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| And the fire marshal is also key in investigations dealing with safety fires and arson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1448)|
| 0:24:17| Of course, the front line really of prevention are the inspectors that are in the field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1457)|
| 0:24:23| communicating with citizens, doing their investigations, handling the code sweeps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| managing the Better Building Board process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1468)|
| 0:24:36| So just to give you an example of these tools, some of the resources that the city is already putting in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1476)|
| 0:24:42| here's the Neighborhood Codes Enforcement, a summary for the year of June 2009 to June 2010, where you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| I'm not going to read all that, but you can see the number of inspections for automobiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| dirty and overgrown lots, building and plates, the number of inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1494)|
| 0:24:59| and reinspections that the staff carried out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1499)|
| 0:25:03| Also the field remediation crew, you can see the number of houses that they secured or boarded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1503)|
| 0:25:08| the number of overgrown lots that they mowed, over 2,000, 2,400, the dirty lot cleanups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| the demolitions and the numbers of cars that they towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| You can also see that when they do these things, they assess the owner for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| but you can see that the assessments are considerably higher than the payments received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1526)|
| 0:25:38| This page shows you the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| About $1.2 million goes into the Neighborhood Codes inspections and to the remediation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| and there are 18 people working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| In addition, I want to add, I don't have a slide for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| but through community development with our various programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| we have about $750,000 a year in general funds to address blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1556)|
| 0:26:06| mainly the facades and then the acquisition of the chronic problem properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1566)|
| 0:26:10| and other blighted properties that really the federal funds aren't good to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| The federal funds are not very flexible, and so council and this mayor has been very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| in providing some general funds that allow us to tackle some issues that we couldn't do so with the federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| We also have about $2 million every year with our CDBG and our home funds for these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1589)|
| 0:26:38| And you all know that with the Empowerment Zone, we had actually out of the Empowerment Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1598)|
| 0:26:44| over the last 10 years, we had about $12.5 million that went into several different projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| dealing with blight mitigation and demolition and new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| Also, in the last few years, we've had just the last year or two, and now for another year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| we will have NSP and the CDBGR funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| We have about $4.2 million of those that are being spent on housing development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| and blighted vacant and foreclosed properties, again, some commercial facade improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1632)|
| 0:27:18| and demolition of blighted properties, for example, the Patton Plastics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| which is a huge blight in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| So here are just a couple examples of what we call the BERT program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| which is the city development loans that end up leveraging private redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| To date, we've had about 10 houses that the private sector has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| or nonprofit housing developers have rehabbed, and 12 new houses have been built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| And this is a good example in Park Ridge of a major change as a result of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1667)|
| 0:27:54| And the next slide shows you this is actually another one in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| This house, by the way, is for sale now, and the owner who did the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| would be really happy if anybody stopped by and gave her a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| It's a beautiful home. I was in it recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| She did a really good job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Okay, so those were some of the tools in prevention and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| When prevention and enforcement doesn't work, then we need to move to try and gain control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| and have measures to force the owner to make improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| The first, of course, is through the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| Their powers, they have the powers to condemn a property and post it as unfit for human habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1714)|
| 0:28:41| They can issue repair or demolition orders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| You all know we have a demolition by neglect ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| However, the ordinance is on the books, but there really is not a funding mechanism in place to implement that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1729)|
| 0:28:59| There's also one of our tools in community development is the powers that the Better Building Board has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| to determine properties to be blighted and then to certify them blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| And that's the first step in our being able to acquire them when it's not in a redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| The next tool we have in gaining control is our powers to acquire blighted properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| and we have two different ways that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| If the blighted property is in a redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| then there is state legislation that gives KCDC the authority to acquire that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1771)|
| 0:29:40| And, of course, this is only done in a council-approved redevelopment area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1780)|
| 0:29:46| but KCDC does carry out our plans in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| If it's not in a redevelopment area, then we have the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| There's a local ordinance that applies to that, and that's the blighted and deteriorated property ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1794)|
| 0:30:01| This helps us deal with spot blight when we don't have a whole geographic area that we're focusing on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| But, again, this is done through that determination and certification of blight process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| that I just mentioned at the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| And then also, once they deem it certified, once they certify it blighted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1814)|
| 0:30:20| then we come to council and ask your approval to purchase the property by eminent domain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| to acquire the property by eminent domain if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| Sometimes we have willing sellers and sometimes we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Another tool in gaining control is the property tax foreclosure process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1839)|
| 0:30:44| when this 1% of the property owners, as I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| when they don't pay their property taxes, then there is a legal process in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| and the city and the county both have the authority, state authority, to foreclose on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1854)|
| 0:31:04| We'll talk about that a little more later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| And then a final tool that we have for gaining control is the nuisance abatement actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| that the Attorney General and KPB, with the assistance of public service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| that we've had, as you know, four properties in recent time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1878)|
| 0:31:23| And later, if you have questions, we've got Captain Jones and Captain Holliday here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| who can address those actions that they are taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| And this is something that I think has proven to be pretty exciting for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| in addressing some of these problems that have been going on for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| So we've talked about prevention and enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| We've talked about when that doesn't work, then what can we do to gain control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| And once we actually do gain control, and that means that we acquire the property by purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| or by eminent domain, even with eminent domain, let's remember, we still pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| We still have to pay fair market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| But when we own this property, then we've got some ways to dispose of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| One way is through our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| This is the properties that we have that are in the Homemakers Program are on the city website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| If somebody is interested in purchasing, they basically put in an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1937)|
| 0:32:23| We have a Homemakers Committee that reviews that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| And if, in fact, there's competition among that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| then there's a rating and a determination as to, you know, who to actually sell it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| There are provisions in the Homemakers Agreement which council approves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| We bring all of those sales to you for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| But we have a clawback provision in that the person who purchases the property has one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1965)|
| 0:32:52| They have to submit a plan to us that we know that they actually have the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| and the plan to redevelop this property or to build something new on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| And if they don't do it within a year, then we have the authority to give them their deposit back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| and their sales price back and get the property back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| So it's a good tool that we have for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| We also have the power to do RFPs, requests for proposals for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| We've talked, I think I may have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2005)|
| 0:33:27| when we brought to you requests to acquire several of those lots across Hermoston East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2007)|
| 0:33:34| that we're considering instead of just selling those individually, we're thinking of doing an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2014)|
| 0:33:40| so that we can get maybe one developer to come in and develop all of those lots together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| And so that's the tool we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| Of course, we also, our real estate manager, he oversees the surplus property sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| There are some times when that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2034)|
| 0:33:59| One of the issues with that is that we don't have any, we have fewer safeguards, let me put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| It's not that we don't have any safeguards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| There will be fewer safeguards about the reuse later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2047)|
| 0:34:14| And there aren't clawback provisions when a property is sold through surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2054)|
| 0:34:25| Okay, so those are the tools that we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| But they're not enough, as you know, as we see every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| So one of the things we've been working on is all of these, the city and county offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| and our other partners, as we mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| One of the things we've been working on is identifying new tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| trying some of these new tools and new strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| The first one is increased utilization of the municipal court by neighborhood codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2089)|
| 0:34:56| Traditionally, codes has utilized the municipal court process for solid waste issues such as dumping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| Codes is now planning to increase their use of this tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| and they've had some preliminary discussions with our municipal court judge, Judge Rawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| One of the things that's being done and that's done effectively in some other cities is to have one certain day set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| or an evening where the judge hears all of these structural violations, all of these issues at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2120)|
| 0:35:30| Otherwise, you have city staff that are sitting in court maybe for hours when they could be out there doing other work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| It's a very ineffective use of their time, and it's possible to streamline it and make the process work a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| So that's something that we're starting to use more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| and anticipate that being an effective way to address the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| The second new tool is to explore increased court penalties for violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2155)|
| 0:36:02| We all know that the $50 a day for a violation doesn't appear to be a deterrent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2162)|
| 0:36:11| There are varying opinions across the state on how to interpret the $50 per day accrual of fines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2171)|
| 0:36:19| We have learned that in Memphis and in Nashville, that they have judges there that have interpreted the law to be that if an inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| comes out on November 1st and there's a violation, and then they come back on November 30th and there's a violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| that by rules of evidence, and I'm not a lawyer, so this is what we have been told by the lawyers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2195)|
| 0:36:45| that they use the rules of evidence and say that for 30 days there has been that violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2205)|
| 0:36:50| and so it's 30 days times 50 rather than just $50 on November 1st and $50 on November 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2210)|
| 0:36:58| So we're going to explore that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Like I said, there are different opinions about that interpretation of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| and that's something we're very interested in seeing whether we can do that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2226)|
| 0:37:13| The third tool is artistic board up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| This really addresses there are always going to be properties that are in transition that are vacant for one reason or another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| even the properties that the city owns, and as we have them in the Homemakers Program, this is just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2242)|
| 0:37:30| Typically, properties that are boarded up or when properties are boarded up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| you see the big piece of plywood across the windows and across the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| There is a system in some places where they do a kind of board up they call artistic board up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| It really means that you cut the plywood and paint it in a certain way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| In some places, they even paint the sort of window frames, and you secure it inside the window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2273)|
| 0:38:01| It's secured better than just nailing up a board, and it's much more attractive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| You can actually drive by some of these houses, and just at a quick glance, you can't tell that it's boarded up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| It's a better way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| It's a little more time intensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2292)|
| 0:38:14| It's a little more costly, but we think it may well be worth it in a lot of these neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2294)|
| 0:38:20| because it's sort of like the broken window theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| If things look bad, then things get worse, and if we can start cleaning up even in this way, it may help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| Our community development and public service, we're in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| We're going to be piloting that this year and do a test on it just to see exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| We've got to pick the right location and get our proper materials and such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| but we are going to implement that in the next couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Another tool is to address the demand and the interest in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| for community gardens and green spaces on city-owned land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2341)|
| 0:39:06| There are some legal issues related to this, and so we're in the process of exploring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| I know Councilman Woodhall has been involved in this and others perhaps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| and we're exploring whether and how we can do this, we can meet this demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| It's been done in other places, so we're going to see how we can do it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2361)|
| 0:39:29| Five is to improve local ordinances as they deal with solid waste and dirty lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| and I'm going to get to that in a minute in more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| The sixth new tool is to develop a better system to be able to track these problem properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| so we can get more up-to-date information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| and that's something that we need to do with MPC and KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| and, again, it's a matter of time and resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2392)|
| 0:40:00| Number seven is funding for blight remediation and acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| You all know that this takes money to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| and we have in the last few years, because of the empowerment zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| and because of neighborhood stabilization funds and the CDBGR funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| we have had more funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| Also, Mayor Haslam and his administration and our councils over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2423)|
| 0:40:28| have put the general fund dollars into acquisition of properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2428)|
| 0:40:35| whereas before we just had federal dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| However, the problem is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| You can always use more money, and we have concerns when these dollars go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2441)|
| 0:40:46| that we won't be able to do as much, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| Also, I'm concerned about future CDBG and home funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2451)|
| 0:40:57| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| We have a new Congress coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| and every year we're at risk of losing CDBG and home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| That would be $2 million or more that we lose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| and that's the core of our budget for addressing this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| Also, under number eight, many of you are aware that on some of these properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| there are underground storage tanks in several of the residential lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| many of them in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| There's buried debris from when houses were demolished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2490)|
| 0:41:34| and kind of dumped into the basements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| This causes a problem for somebody who wants to purchase the lot and build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2497)|
| 0:41:44| It's not cost effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| And so if we had a funding mechanism to address,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| to remediate those environmental hazards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| it would help with the redevelopment of some of these vacant or blighted lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| Number nine, the new tool we need is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| another new tool we need is the reform of property tax foreclosure laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| We have, there are a lot of problems, and we can't get into all those now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2529)|
| 0:42:15| but if you have specific questions, we have Chad Tindall here from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| trustee's office and Donna Dyer, who's from our revenue collection office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| and they can address the problems with property tax foreclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| The bottom line, it's expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2548)|
| 0:42:30| There's a long time, it takes a long time to even get a property tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| And the biggest problem is once it's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| these properties do not have insurable titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| That is our biggest problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| So all those properties you saw earlier that we take to tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| the city or the county, they end up with insurable titles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| many of them uninsurable titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Many of them, the people who do actually purchase them at tax sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| find out they can't do anything with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| and often they end up in a future tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| It's a big, big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| And so what we have been doing is meeting as a city, county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2582)|
| 0:43:07| and city and county offices I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| meeting to talk about some potential reform legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| And we've got 15 or 16 different possibilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| but we're now trying to narrow those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| We actually had a conference call recently with the Center for Community Progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| which is the new name of the Genesee Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| They merged with some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2608)|
| 0:43:30| And we're getting some advice from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| We're also talking with some of the other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| particularly the other big cities in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2616)|
| 0:43:40| to see if there's interest to work together to try and make some of these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| So there's a lot to do in terms of developing the appropriate strategy that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2624)|
| 0:43:51| given the recent elections, you know, what will work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| what will the interest be in Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| That's something we have to figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| Obviously, we know the governor, the future governor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| and he's been very supportive of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| Number ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| Number nine is about when we take more properties to tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| we have a problem because we know every time we take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| we end up with uninsurable titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| Number ten addresses the fact that right now today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| the city and the county owns properties from a tax sale that have a bad title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| So we're trying to figure out the best strategy to clear titles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| and the taxes that still remain on those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| We've mentioned before land bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| That's one strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| There may be ways like to transfer some of these properties to KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| We do that on occasion where they can take them through a condemnation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2690)|
| 0:44:54| There's a variety of strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2694)|
| 0:44:57| Well, there are a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| I'm not sure how many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| They're not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| But we would like to focus on trying to clean up those properties that we have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| that are in a strategic location that impacts other redevelopment that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| And finally, we are looking at developing a statewide strategy with the other big cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| and anybody else that wants to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| The Center for Community Progress that I just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| they expressed an interest in helping us with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| and they actually have some resources available in their program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| to bring together some selected states to work on statewide strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| dealing with vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| So we are hoping to be a part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2743)|
| 0:45:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| I mentioned that there were some local ordinance changes that CODES would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Some of those have to do with solid waste,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2752)|
| 0:45:56| such as trash receptacles must be moved off of the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2756)|
| 0:46:00| and solid waste violations such as rental cleanouts and medical waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| These are an immediate threat to health and safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| CODES needs the ability to immediately clean it up and bill if necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| rather than having to give notice and have it delayed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| which is what they have to do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| In terms of dirty lots, we need the ability to address unfit or blighting storage of materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2782)|
| 0:46:31| allow removal of dangerous trees that threaten use of public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2791)|
| 0:46:35| and allow the city to clean lots of repeat offenders without the 10-day corrective action period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| if the specific address has confirmed violations within a certain time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| What will happen is, you know, there's a lot that needs to be mowed or cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2806)|
| 0:46:52| You have to post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| You have to take so many days, and finally we go back and mow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| and then we have to repeat it all over again, and they let it grow up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| You've got to post it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2820)|
| 0:47:01| You have to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2821)|
| 0:47:02| And our team needs to be able to just, if you've done it once and you've not responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| and we've had to mow you, then we can mow you the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We don't have to post it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Repeat offenders should not get this kind of, you know, we need to be tougher with repeat offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| And the other is to allow the city to declare dilapidated fences a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| So those are some examples of local ordinance changes that we would like to get implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2846)|
| 0:47:34| Now, there are many other strategies in other cities and states that are possibilities in addressing these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2854)|
| 0:47:44| You can see them listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| We are concentrating first on where we think we can make a more immediate difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2867)|
| 0:47:53| but we're also considering some of these other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| The key is that no one size fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| It really varies depending on our own state-enabling legislation, on your local ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2880)|
| 0:48:07| on the degree of the problem in a particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| Some of these strategies are more relevant than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| The political realities, obviously, are a big part of the situation too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2895)|
| 0:48:21| in deciding which of those strategies will work or which ones you can get legislation passed at local or state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2901)|
| 0:48:29| Okay, so in conclusion, the causes and the solutions are complex, but they're not insurmountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2909)|
| 0:48:36| There are tools, there are strategies out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| There's no silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| Any community needs a variety of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| As has been said to me, every single property has its own story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2924)|
| 0:48:48| Every single property has its own unique set of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| and so we need a variety of tools to be able to address them depending on what the needs are for any specific property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2931)|
| 0:49:00| This is not something that will happen overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| We need a long-term commitment from the city, from the council, from the community to address these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2942)|
| 0:49:08| We need stronger disincentives for owners of blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2948)|
| 0:49:12| And very importantly, we need a new conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| We need to talk about that property ownership involves both rights and responsibilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2955)|
| 0:49:21| You know, if you have a blighted property next door to me, I have property rights too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2961)|
| 0:49:28| and your lack of responsibility is impacting my property rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| and I think we really need to talk about that and understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| And finally, government plays a key role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| You've seen all the ways we do, but all stakeholders really need to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| That means the private sector, especially the real estate, the title and the financial industries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| of course our community-based nonprofits, our neighborhood organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2990)|
| 0:49:55| So that is our overview of the problem and some of the tools that we have and the tools that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| And so we've got a team of people here that will be glad to try and address any of your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3001)|
| 0:50:08| Let me start with Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| I've got a couple of questions here that are a statement too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| I mean, one of the things that really stands out to me, I can't, for some reason, I can't see all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| I think it was like 8,500 blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| I mean, it's a lot of properties and 18 folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| That, to council, I mean, we need perhaps to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| I don't know we could get enough bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| but it's always an avenue that we could go down to perhaps increase some folks on the ground here to help out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3036)|
| 0:50:48| One thing I noticed that really stands out is the decrease in the payments received when they've been fined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3048)|
| 0:50:57| It seems like to me they've caught on that perhaps we're not going to really do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3057)|
| 0:51:03| Dave, you look real anxious to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Let me jump into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| There was a period where I had an employee that was close to retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| She wanted a project, and she was very eager to tackle some very old liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| At ten years, we either make a decision to refile the lien or to let the lien become null and void,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| and law can comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| I had an employee, Marilyn Watson, that wanted to take that on, and she tackled that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| That period where we see that spike, and then they drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| A huge spike was Marilyn bird-dogging a lot of our customers that haven't paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3095)|
| 0:51:41| And she got that to go up, but then the economy hit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| and we've seen a decrease in those fees being paid since the economy has gotten more challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| So while that was a combination of us trying to address some very old files,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3110)|
| 0:51:55| and we had an employee that was very eager to do that, and then also the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| Well, I mean, do you think that just like what Mr. Tindall does, I mean, would it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| do you think it would be beneficial, and I don't want to put you on the spot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| but to have a person dedicated to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3130)|
| 0:52:13| I mean, all these programs are great, but these programs, a lot of them are going to take a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| And when you start talking about educating people, I don't know that you can educate these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| They do, I think a lot of it is just deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| They're going to say, we're going to push it to the max, and no matter what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| we're not going to do the right thing until we're made to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| So, you know, if you had a person dedicated, I mean, obviously the amount of money that was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| the fines levied and the fees collected, I mean, obviously you could have a full-time person doing that or persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3162)|
| 0:52:50| Yes, and I think the challenge with the fees and liens is the folks that pay those are usually not the chronic violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3170)|
| 0:52:57| It's somebody that was in the hospital, and we mowed their lot once, and they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| They come in and pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3182)|
| 0:53:03| So we still have the issue with the abandoned property where nobody's ever going to come in and pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3183)|
| 0:53:09| and they've got 15 liens, and we've demolished the house and have a lien on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| And then those liens almost become an encumbrance for the private sector to redevelop that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| because there's these costs associated with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| So that's probably something to explore with this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| I think the tax reform component is huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| And I think the group all agreed that that was a huge component, how we deal with folks that don't pay their taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| and then how we address that through the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| Well, that's still, I won't be argumentative, but those figures, you're talking about one-offs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| or people that generally just would come right back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| But, I mean, the figures don't show that necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| So you're saying most of them aren't chronic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| I mean, these fines that are levied aren't generally?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| No, no, many of them are the chronic violators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| They're folks that, and there is an issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Once we place a lien on the property, it just sits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| It doesn't accrue penalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| We talked about, you know, is there a way to have a lien that over time continues to accrue penalty fees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3251)|
| 0:54:19| I mean, and the tax folks would have to talk about that, but they've got that tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3259)|
| 0:54:23| So once it becomes a lien, there's not much incentive to pay the lien once it's placed on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3263)|
| 0:54:29| unless you hope to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| Or, yeah, that's when we get paid oftentimes is during an acquisition and a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| One other question and then I'll just be quiet and I see a lot of lights on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| so I don't want to hog the show here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3282)|
| 0:54:45| But, Madeline, I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| I was very interested in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| The court cases are where they've gone the 30 by 50 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| And I was just curious if that had been tested in any courts, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| if they'd been challenged and if you knew what the results were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Because that is where you get people the most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| When you hit them in the pocketbook, you're going to get their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| And that is, I think, a very effective tool right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3308)|
| 0:55:13| I'm going to ask David Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| He's spoken with some of the folks in Memphis that are implementing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| Yes, I've talked to people in both Nashville and Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| In some cases, the clock starts ticking not when the notice of violation is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3324)|
| 0:55:32| but when a judge determines that the violation exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| The city in both cases has to have very good evidence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| photographic evidence that the violation exists on day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| and on day 31 in order to apply the 30 days times $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3350)|
| 0:55:58| Again, there's a reasonable difference of legal opinion on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| But they are doing it in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| They are doing it in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| And to answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| I've asked both of them and neither of them have been challenged on that law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| on that interpretation of rules of evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3373)|
| 0:56:16| Well, I think it's very interesting because, obviously, we don't have the resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3376)|
| 0:56:20| We would have to go out every day of that month and cite again to be able to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| So I think this is something that could be very beneficial in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| Thank you, Mr. Pravlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Let me go to Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3396)|
| 0:56:37| A point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| Back on the map, the first of the two maps that showed vacant property and then blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| and there was a number Mr. Pravlis threw out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| I don't remember whether it was 8,500 or 8,900 vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| But not all vacant properties are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| That's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| And Mr. O'Hara leaned over and said those were just vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| Those weren't all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| They're not 8,500 vacant and blighted properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| And I'm sorry I didn't write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| Did we get a number how many blighted properties we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| I think council is trying to get our arms around the magnitude of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3429)|
| 0:57:19| We have two different sources of data on vacancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| One comes from KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| We asked KUB to give us a list of all of the addresses where there had been electrical water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| or sewage service that had been interrupted for more than a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| And there were several thousand of those throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| Then there's another source of data which MPC relies on the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| and it's a category of use of the property, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| And that's where the 8,500, give or take, comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3471)|
| 0:57:56| And there's a division there on your map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3476)|
| 0:57:58| The darker green is parcels less than two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| The lighter green are parcels of more than two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3484)|
| 0:58:05| That does not necessarily mean that those properties are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| Vacant properties can mean a parcel of vacant building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3490)|
| 0:58:16| They do not necessarily have to be blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| And so that would include a property that is vacant that has a building on it, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| and then a property that is vacant that has no building on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| No structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3509)|
| 0:58:30| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| But then how many are blighted, do we think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| Well, one of the things that MPC did for us was to, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3515)|
| 0:58:41| let me just point out that we've got our, you know, as we get into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| and this has happened in a lot of places around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| when you start getting into this and try to get your hands around being able to identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| how many blighted properties are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| it's not easy to do unless you do a door-to-door survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| And even then it's difficult because, in some cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| there may be legal definitions that you've got to worry about, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| But if their interpretation, just one way of looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| was based on the number of codes violations from 2004 through, I think, 2009, or midway through 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3554)|
| 0:59:23| And that came up with something over 700 parcels that were deemed blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| as a result of having one or more structural violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| one or more dirty lot violations, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| There was a formula to it, and I've got that if you want to get into detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| but basically we just put some severity on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3582)|
| 0:59:48| In other words, these weren't just single violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| They were multiple violations on these 700-and-something parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| As you saw from the example in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| here's a set of properties that doesn't necessarily have a huge number of structural violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3598)|
| 1:00:05| Some of those properties, some are in reasonably good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| They're boarded, they're just boarded, and they're blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| It's blighted, but it doesn't necessarily meet our definition of blight, technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| So I think there are more than 1,000 blighted properties in the city, but that is just an estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3617)|
| 1:00:26| That's one of the things that we need to get our arms around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| Can we go back to that map just for a second in the slide presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| Is that too difficult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| It was the first of the two maps right after the pictures of all the houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| It might be helpful if you would tell us what you call blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3642)|
| 1:00:45| Is it just the violation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3645)|
| 1:00:48| So when we look at this map, the green colors, vacant parcels are not necessarily blighted parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3648)|
| 1:00:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Vacant is the 8,500 we were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| And then the colors at the top, nuisance structures, nuisance lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| that was based on the data that you got from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| No, those four at the top are based on data supplied from the Permits Plus database of Neighborhood Codes Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3667)|
| 1:01:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| And, you know, what that graphic shows more than anything is just, I mean, we didn't have the ability at this stage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| to be able to churn out a list of what we might think were blighted properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3685)|
| 1:01:33| or chronic problem properties, but rather to show the pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| Overall, what are we looking at and where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| And what that map shows is that the vacancy lots and the blighted properties track basically in certain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3702)|
| 1:01:55| It's widespread, but it's also concentrated in certain neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| Well, and I think this informs our consolidated plan one-year update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| Remember that we targeted certain areas where we're focusing our dollars to try to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| where we know we have a larger issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| My other question is just a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| And when we were talking about tools for strategic reuse, the first question is a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3735)|
| 1:02:24| Madeline, you talked about the surplus property sale through the real estate department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| and then we have fewer safeguards for reuse with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| Clarify the difference between the surplus property sale and the sales we have through our homemakers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3752)|
| 1:02:38| So how does a property end up in surplus property versus the homemakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| And is there a way to get more safeguards embedded in our surplus property sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3763)|
| 1:02:51| I would like to ask Lee Miracle to come and address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| He's our real estate manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| He can do it best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| And while he's coming down, my other quick question for you was the clawback provision in the homemakers program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3778)|
| 1:03:04| How often do we find we have to use that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| We have the one-year time frame for folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| Are we screening candidates to the point that most of those are able to accomplish their renovations or their reuse in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3791)|
| 1:03:19| Most of them accomplish it within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| We have to do an extension, but we'll do that when they're progressing well on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3802)|
| 1:03:29| The recent turndown in the market for housing those has made some of that more difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| A lot of those properties are purchased by nonprofits, and their capacity is limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3816)|
| 1:03:43| They've got to unload their inventory before they can take on more projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3823)|
| 1:03:48| But we've had a pretty good success with homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3828)|
| 1:03:53| There haven't been many we've had to take back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| There have been a couple, and there have been a few voluntarily returned to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| And that says to me that the clawback provision is working, because ultimately we want the person who gets the property through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| homemakers to succeed, but the fact that we have that tool in place and that's part of the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| and there's an upfront expectation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3853)|
| 1:04:15| I think also in homemakers, they sign a purchase agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3855)|
| 1:04:19| and it lays out several steps that they need to accomplish before we give them title to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3859)|
| 1:04:26| including getting their permanent financing together, getting their plans completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| And so that's another control we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3872)|
| 1:04:35| And sometimes it takes them a few months to get through that process before we issue them a title to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| and they can actually proceed with construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Then they have the year to actually complete their project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| And, Mr. Merkle, my question was the surplus property sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| We understand that there are fewer safeguards for the ultimate reuse of a property, that it will actually be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3892)|
| 1:05:00| How do properties end up, particularly residential properties, end up in your surplus property sales?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| And is there any way to put better safeguards in that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3907)|
| 1:05:12| The ones that we get that end up in, well, I'll say in our surplus property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| are properties that are not bid on by somebody at a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| So we wind up getting them by default.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| We get a clerk and master's deed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| When we do sell those, it is by a sealed bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| So there are no restrictions as to what they do with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3936)|
| 1:05:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| So I guess maybe that's a question for the law department going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Is there any way to take kind of the model that we've done with the Homemakers Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| and somehow work that into our surplus property sales so that we've got a little more just up front expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3950)|
| 1:05:58| with the buyer that the seller expects that this is going to go back into active reuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| I think that would require a change in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| Right now there are no restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3966)|
| 1:06:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Just a monetary sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3973)|
| 1:06:14| Yeah, that answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3974)|
| 1:06:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| Let's also remember that he just mentioned that most of these are the properties that he gets through the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| So these have uninsurable titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| So even if we put them through a Homemakers-type process, if that was possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3982)|
| 1:06:28| there's very little opportunity to redevelop them properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| And the uninsurable title thing has to be addressed, as I remember, from the Genesee Institute at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| I mean, that's where we're looking at some of those tools like land banking and all that can help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| If you want to get into that, there's also some issues with the title companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| I don't know if you want to address that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| I would ask Donna Dyer to address some of those issues if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| I'll give another council member some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| All right, Laura.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Are there any other questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4016)|
| 1:06:57| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| Thank you, Ms. Miracle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4018)|
| 1:06:59| I have next on line Mr. Woodhall, Mr. Dillowberry, Mr. Greven, and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| So, Mr. Woodhall, and I'll put Ms. Palmer at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Madeline, you gave us about four pages of tools and strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| and I definitely heard you say you've been talking to other cities and you went to the conferences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| so you're getting a lot of good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| What makes the difference in some of the cities that really are having an impact?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| Is it choosing just the right leveraging tools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4046)|
| 1:07:33| I mean, a program could actually work in and of itself but not really build strong neighborhoods, wouldn't you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4053)|
| 1:07:40| Well, I think you need leadership, obviously, both from the mayor's office, from city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4060)|
| 1:07:47| from our departments, and in the community, people that really want to work hard at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| and will push for the results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| So leadership, in your mind, would look like what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Would it look like choosing the programs that really give us the leveraging impact, commit ourselves to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4077)|
| 1:08:05| I mean, tell me more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4085)|
| 1:08:10| I'll start, and then David was chomping at the bit to answer too, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| It means adopting some of these changes, the ordinance changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4094)|
| 1:08:19| It's looking at addressing the saying that we are going to take on property reforms at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4099)|
| 1:08:30| We're going to be actively working with our state legislative delegation, contacting other cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| having both the community will and the political will to change because there are always the pushback on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4115)|
| 1:08:41| You know, there are the property owners who are going to threaten to sue the minute you try to put the pressure on them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| and we've got to be able to stand up to them and say, you know, like we said before, we've got property rights too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| Those that are next door, you have responsibilities as well as rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4134)|
| 1:08:58| I think that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| But it's strengthening the tools that we have, having the leadership that will make the changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| whether it's legislation needed at the state level, working for that, or at the local level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4144)|
| 1:09:11| and having the staff capacity, the funding mechanisms in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| It's all about where you put your priorities, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| You know, we don't have unlimited funds, but how we utilize those funds to get the biggest bang for the buck is important too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4160)|
| 1:09:26| Is there a city you have in mind, a comparable city that has made a lot of progress that you can think of, an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4166)|
| 1:09:37| Well, there are cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| I mean, every city is unique, right, that are dealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4181)|
| 1:09:44| You know, if you're talking about property tax foreclosures, Flint, Michigan, the things that they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| they really have led the way at Genesee, the Genesee Institute in Genesee County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| Of course, they have a major problem up there of thousands and thousands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| They have whole neighborhoods basically shut down because of vacancies and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4201)|
| 1:10:07| But our issue is the way in which vacant properties weaken the fabric of our community, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4207)|
| 1:10:15| I'm sorry, say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4215)|
| 1:10:16| That our vacant properties, our blighted properties weaken the fabric of our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4216)|
| 1:10:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4222)|
| 1:10:23| So that's our unique situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| Is there another city that has comparably addressed this in a way that they've succeeded, that you've learned from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4225)|
| 1:10:35| Louisville, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| They took on this fight several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4237)|
| 1:10:40| There are cities in Ohio, several cities in Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| I believe I should call on David Massey because he was just at the most recent gathering of folks in Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4244)|
| 1:10:52| Louisville, Kentucky is one example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| We were up there for the conference in June of 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| And what did they say made the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Like when you're in the hallway and you really get the real answer, what do they say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| The legislative changes and then the focus from the mayor, from the council, from the department heads to get it done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4267)|
| 1:11:17| and they work in collaboration with their community, with the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4277)|
| 1:11:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Mr. Dellavope is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4284)|
| 1:11:25| And, Ms. Rowdy, is that a new light or an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| Mr. Dellavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| Since we have Chad Tindall here and Debbie Poplin, maybe we can get you guys coming up to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4291)|
| 1:11:37| To tell us a little bit about these tax titles, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| If we're out there suing on a tax lien and have the property sold or foreclosed on, what is the defect in title?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| Is it the right of redemption in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| What keeps people from buying these and redeveloping them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4311)|
| 1:11:56| I'm going to ask Gordon to come up here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| The only thing that I would say is that the problem is it's not the one-year redemption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4319)|
| 1:12:04| They know that going in, and that's not that big of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4324)|
| 1:12:08| It is a problem, or at least it may ward off some potential buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| But the problem is that you're unable to, in many instances, serve all of the interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4331)|
| 1:12:19| You have questions over who owns the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| You have questions over their heirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4341)|
| 1:12:23| You have questions over whether you can give proper notice to those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| And you also have certain statutes of limitation that impact, you know, the rights of these heirs to come back and sue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4346)|
| 1:12:32| to recover their property, all of these issues which impact the title insurance company's ability to issue a title insurance policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| which would then, and this all goes to the fact of whether an owner of a property can go to a bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| and pledge this property under a deed of trust and borrow money to redevelop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| If they can't, if the bank cannot get insurable title to protect their deed of trust,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| then, well, they can't borrow money against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| So, therefore, that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| Now, the one thing that our committee has talked about, and Doug, frankly, knows probably much better than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4378)|
| 1:13:03| because he's come up with a list of things that we have discussed within our committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| are some legislative changes that we can make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| We can shorten up maybe some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| We can make some changes legislatively that give that title insurance company more comfort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4391)|
| 1:13:18| and give their underwriters the ability to maybe issue insurable title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| That's the other issue is that, and as what I think you're going to see in each council person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4402)|
| 1:13:27| when we discuss all of these things, there is no silver bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| It's a multifaceted approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| It's the title issue that is certainly a huge issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4412)|
| 1:13:36| There are many others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4416)|
| 1:13:37| But when you're talking about, we also have to work with these title insurance companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4417)|
| 1:13:42| and the title insurance people that do business within Tennessee and say, how is it that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4422)|
| 1:13:47| what are the problems that you have, the biggest problems, and how can we resolve those legislatively?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4427)|
| 1:13:52| It's very difficult, as you can imagine, to create laws that tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| and instruct an insurance company to write a title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| No, but you can have, I assume legislatively, some way to give, in the worst case that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4441)|
| 1:14:08| scattered errors that you can't find, some kind of publication notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| since they have property in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| We do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| I mean, we do publish notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| We need state laws that somehow say that the curtain comes down after a certain amount of steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| so that regardless of whether you had it right or not, it's foreclosed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| I'll let Doug speak to that, because he's done a good bit of research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| And there was talk about Flint, Michigan, maybe having solved this problem to some success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4468)|
| 1:14:33| Well, we already have laws that say that the tax sale title is good and solid title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| that we can do service by publication, that it's good service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4479)|
| 1:14:44| The problem is that the Supreme Court has said that even though these are in rem actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| as opposed to in personam actions, you still have to conduct personal service whenever you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| per the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| And that means that you have to try your best to find these individuals and serve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| But as soon as you've attained a judgment that is based upon service by publication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4506)|
| 1:15:11| you've introduced questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4511)|
| 1:15:13| So you've got doubt, and the insurance company balks when they see doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| They balk when they see doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| They balk when they see that service by publication because they don't want to take any risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| And they are private companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4526)|
| 1:15:27| and enacting new laws to help them issue title insurance is sort of like pushing on a string,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4527)|
| 1:15:33| which is why we're trying to get the title insurance lobby to tell us what they would like to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| to buy into the statutes that we are suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| But ultimately, it comes down to getting good personal service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| and trying to rely as little as possible on that service by publication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4547)|
| 1:15:52| Now, there's a whole other avenue regarding why service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| why title companies don't like title sales, why they don't like tax sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4556)|
| 1:16:00| But to shorten this, because we're going to take the whole time doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| you're looking at that and seeing if we can find a way to bring both the private interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4563)|
| 1:16:08| the insurance interest, and the state laws to get a tighter clamp on the title when we do sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| We've come up with a number of strategies, and I have a tendency to kind of lobby the few that I like the most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4575)|
| 1:16:24| but that would take a lot of time, and I'll back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| Well, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4588)|
| 1:16:29| I wonder if we've got Captain Holiday here, if he could come up for a second and talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| There are, it seems like in every neighborhood, there's one or two or three properties that generate dozens of calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4597)|
| 1:16:44| and e-mails and upset folks, and I know that I share those with you from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4604)|
| 1:16:50| and you've been wonderful about getting your staff to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| but what do you see about these kind of nuisance landlords or something that are renting to people that engage in crime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4613)|
| 1:17:00| whether it's drugs or prostitution or just, you know, other activities that shouldn't be in a neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4620)|
| 1:17:06| It is a huge problem for us, and the big problem is that the people have no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4626)|
| 1:17:14| The people living in the houses have no accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| The landlords, the people that own these houses, the vacant landlords, have no accountability for what's going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| and it has become a or it is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| It's an ongoing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| We recognize it, and it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| We've been in contact almost on a daily basis about some of the houses in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4650)|
| 1:17:35| Vice Mayor Becker, we've been in contact about some houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| It's a huge problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| South Knoxville has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4660)|
| 1:17:41| South Knoxville has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4661)|
| 1:17:42| Probably not a district in this city that doesn't have problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| The tools that we have, of course, are just basic old-fashioned police work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| A residence on Oklahoma that you and I are working on, we've seen a huge drop in activity there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| just because of the old-fashioned police work that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| One of the tools that we have now, and it was up on the PowerPoint, is the nuisance ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| That's something that we've been able to use for the past few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| Is that like what you did at the hotel on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| That's what we did at the Deluxe Inn on Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| We did it at Mickey T's on Central, Orange Bar on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| You just clamp down on them if they're running something with repeated criminal activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| If we can identify, and there's a lot of investigative work that goes in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| but if we can identify that a business is conducting illegal activity there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| then we're able to go in on a civil order through the attorney general's office and the courts, shut it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| The business owner has to appear before the court and give cause why they should open back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4717)|
| 1:18:41| or why they're not a public nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4721)|
| 1:18:43| The place is boarded up until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| So far, we've only had one business that's actually come back and met with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| that has agreed to meet certain criteria to reopen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| That was at Deluxe Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4733)|
| 1:18:54| Deluxe Inn went from the top call for service location in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Now we're almost nothing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| It's been a great tool for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| And through talking to the attorney general's office and some other law enforcement that use this tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| it can be used for private residences, I have found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| But we have a burden of proof that we want to meet before we take that to court, before we use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| So you've got a lot of police work to gather evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| You go to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4756)|
| 1:19:17| There's time involved in clamping one of those down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| It's sort of like an injunction, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| It is like a civil injunction that they have to close the place down because they're a danger to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4761)|
| 1:19:27| And it's funny, a lot of the people that we've talked to, we've had great community support by using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4767)|
| 1:19:34| A question was asked, well, what about this business being boarded up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Is that not a blight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| Well, no, we'd rather have the plywood up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| And to think somebody will come back later and do something good with this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| not have it conducting illegal activity that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| Because, as you all know, you have illegal activity going on in one house, that's going to ruin the entire neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| And I know I've heard in places like Park Ridge and other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4795)|
| 1:19:59| if you spend a lot of energy running them out of one place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| there's a landlord down the block that will rent to them and they just shift over and you start all over again kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| It's constant displacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| We displace them from one house, they'll just go to another place that will take them in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| and let them live for six months, pay the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| So they leapfrog down the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| Just go from place to place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4820)|
| 1:20:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| I want to thank you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4822)|
| 1:20:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4823)|
| 1:20:24| It sounds like we need some kind of a landlord ordinance or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4824)|
| 1:20:30| I know that Oak Ridge attempted that, Madeleine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| They apparently pulled the plug back in October last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| They were going with an ordinance that would require registration and a license before you can rent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4838)|
| 1:20:45| and that you had to have a local representative in the area that would be responsive to requests for inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4845)|
| 1:20:53| that you had to consent to inspection in order to be this kind of licensor of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| And I guess they ran into a big property rights kind of battle over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4859)|
| 1:21:04| and they decided to back down and not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| But there's some tool we need that gets us control of problem landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4866)|
| 1:21:12| who are just looking for a check and don't care about the thing you were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| that social compact that if you're going to live in an area or rent in an area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| that you have a duty to everyone around you to meet some minimum requirements of decency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4880)|
| 1:21:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Also, that current state-enabling legislation that is for the landlord registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| it's limited to Nashville and Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| The way the law was passed, it limited it to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Oh, it's just a target for a local community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| But it's weak in that it limits the registration fee to $10 per landlord, regardless of the number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| So there would be an inadequate revenue stream to even be able to enforce it without putting a lot of extra dollars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| To fund the enforcement tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4914)|
| 1:21:55| So you would need, if we pursue that type of strategy or tool, you really need to change the state legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4915)|
| 1:22:03| But I'm sure there was a whole history to how it was watered down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4923)|
| 1:22:09| I doubt that the original legislation had $10 per landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4929)|
| 1:22:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4933)|
| 1:22:14| And so I'm sure it went through the process and was whittled down to that and makes it tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4934)|
| 1:22:21| I'll pass to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| We'll go to Mr. Greave next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4943)|
| 1:22:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4945)|
| 1:22:28| Madeline, one of the things, one of the questions I have, and maybe you have this information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4948)|
| 1:22:32| but do you really have a complete inventory or does there need to be a complete inventory on, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| what we do have in terms of the lots in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| I mean, how many lots do we have in the city of Knoxville, would you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| Are you talking about the ones that we own?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| No, I'm talking about just overall, general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| In other words, what I'm looking at is that, let's say there's 10,000 lots in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4970)|
| 1:22:56| I don't know how many there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| I've been told 72,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| Total parcels in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| These aren't vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Just total, 72,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| That's what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4989)|
| 1:23:10| And out of that, she said there's 8,500 vacant parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4990)|
| 1:23:16| Based on property assessor data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| So we really haven't done, we haven't really done an inventory where someone's actually going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| and looked at all these properties, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5003)|
| 1:23:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5008)|
| 1:23:29| I mean, that's one of the difficulties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| I guess what I'm getting at is, is this something that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5011)|
| 1:23:34| that there ought to be a real inventory done in terms of what I understand you said earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| there's 8,500 vacant lots, and of those, only 700 are blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| That's not necessarily, those may overlap for sure, but those aren't necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5026)|
| 1:23:51| one is not necessarily a subset of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5031)|
| 1:23:55| I mean, you know, we've got different databases, KUB, property assessor, codes enforcement, tax collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| KPD 911, these don't talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| So one of the, and that's expensive to talk about getting all of those databases in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| where we could type in a certain address and figure out what are the calls for service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| what are the codes violations, is there tax due on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| That's what we would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| And then from that database be able to spit out real totals that we can map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| What we have here are some guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| That's what I'm getting around to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| I mean, what would it cost to get a really good database in terms of having a real understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| of what we have within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5083)|
| 1:24:46| For instance, there's uninhabitable property, which is probably blighted, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5086)|
| 1:24:51| But is there blighted property that's habitable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5093)|
| 1:24:54| Well, I don't know about habitable, but yes, there is blighted property that people are living in, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| I mean, but again, I mean, there's a specific, in our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| there's a specific definition of blight that we use for certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| And then there's just a general, what a neighborhood would think of as blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5108)|
| 1:25:13| and those things may or may not be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| But on the data part of it, we are going down the road of trying to figure out how to do a property tracking system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5119)|
| 1:25:27| where we can really get our hands on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| And it's critical in terms of all these other things that we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Well, that's what I'm getting around to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| I mean, do you know what something like that costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| We're not there yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| We don't know, but that's number six on our list is to develop a system to track data on problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5137)|
| 1:25:42| We don't know yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5142)|
| 1:25:43| I don't know if Tim's saying he can't tell you either at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5143)|
| 1:25:48| Your blighted property includes both residential and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5148)|
| 1:25:52| No, those are just residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| It's just residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| How do you deal with a blighted commercial the same way, or are you not dealing with blighted commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5156)|
| 1:26:04| I mean, I can think of a number of areas where I'll drive down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| and I'll see what is supposedly commercial, but it certainly is, in my estimation, it's certainly blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5167)|
| 1:26:14| And I especially know up in the area off Broadway that a lot of that property has really had a bad effect on the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5174)|
| 1:26:22| So, I mean, have you made that distinction yet, or is that something that's a whole other big step?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5182)|
| 1:26:29| No, but I think your question was how do we address blighted commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| If it's an overgrown lot, we can address it through the overgrown lot dirty lot ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| If it's something other than that, if it's a building violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| then Mr. Gary Norman, Tom Reynolds, and Anita Cash can address it through the Better Building Board process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| They can also address it through inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| They can also, I believe, take those folks to court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| Gary's here if you want him to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5211)|
| 1:26:53| There are similar processes for dealing with commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And the Neighborhood Code's office, that's kind of the dividing line for us is we handle residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| If it's commercial or business, then Mr. Norman handles that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5222)|
| 1:27:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5225)|
| 1:27:06| But it just seems to me what I'm getting around to is like your item number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| is that if we had some idea of what something like that would cost, it seems to me that's the beginning or the foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5229)|
| 1:27:15| and that it's not only just residential, but it's also commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| In other words, it's almost as though we need a database for all the parcels in our city on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| So it's something we could maybe look at if we knew what the cost was on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you, Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| I'm going to have myself next, and then Ms. Palmer, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| Just a process thing first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| If you're interested in speaking at public forum, we have a sign-up sheet over here under the giant map of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5257)|
| 1:27:43| I wanted to follow up real quick on Mr. Greave's comment about the database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5263)|
| 1:27:47| and it sounds like that's something that's real important and some good thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| I guess just to stress having everybody being able to talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| I hate to have a lot of work going into a database, and we find out that KPD can't, that their data doesn't connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5274)|
| 1:28:01| So I know that's a challenge, but it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| I actually wanted to just ask one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| We've got here some ideas for new ordinances to come down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5286)|
| 1:28:11| and I wanted to hear a little bit about timing on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| because there are some of these that I heard ideas about some of these same things years and years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5293)|
| 1:28:18| and they've never showed up, and one is just timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| and the other is for some of these, if you've got something you want to get on the agenda, send it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| I'll get it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| I guess I can't get it on next Tuesday's agenda, but we'll get it on, because we've got to move some of these things forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5308)|
| 1:28:35| But do you all have ideas on when the next ones will be coming to city council for some specific changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5315)|
| 1:28:42| I don't have an exact timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5324)|
| 1:28:45| Many of these have been concepts we've talked about for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| I think we're at the point with this committee and with the interdepartmental coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| that we're ready to sit down with law, with some drafts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| and start to work through what would be legal and enforceable and feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5337)|
| 1:29:01| So I hope, you know, some of it's been pushed down a priority list just with other projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5341)|
| 1:29:08| but I hope in the next six months that we have a good feel for these ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| I mean, we're ready to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| I feel good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5354)|
| 1:29:15| We also want to start utilizing municipal court more often with our folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5355)|
| 1:29:19| That's been more of just a policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5359)|
| 1:29:21| We use it for solid waste, and we can use it for other things we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| The penalty aside, if we could accrual larger penalties, that would help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| but just the nuisance of having to go to court, especially if we had a single day for court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| if we could work with a judge and get a codes court or a sanitation court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| where our inspectors could go every Wednesday morning and be first on the docket, would be really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| So those are some things I think you'll see very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5386)|
| 1:29:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| Let me go to Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| I recently met with Mr. Brace, Mr. Norman, Ms. Cash, Mr. Reynolds, and Mr. Moyers about this very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5390)|
| 1:29:57| Do we need some ordinances strengthened or rewritten or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5397)|
| 1:30:02| And so I'm encouraged that we're moving in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| I'm somewhat impatient about some things, and I'd like to move faster than the wheels often turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| So I'm very positive about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| I know from a couple of things in my district that going to court can be an exciting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| and a very time-consuming process, particularly when the person doesn't appear who has the violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| and then you have to go back and back and back, and it's a very wearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5424)|
| 1:30:29| So I'm encouraged that we're looking at rearranging perhaps the schedule of the city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5429)|
| 1:30:36| so that we can have a specific time for a specific thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| and not spend the whole day waiting for this to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| My question is, how soon are we moving to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Three months, six months, six years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| I said I was impatient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Can I give a season?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I would say we're going to sit down with the judge, and the judge is exceedingly supportive of neighborhood codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5457)|
| 1:31:04| I mean, I think you saw that when we were in court on Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| So we just need to sit down with the judge and work that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| And I would say in the next few months, winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| You have my support for that, and also getting everybody's computer systems to talk with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| and then let's get the ordinances where they need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Let me go to Mr. Brown, and then Mr. Bailey, and then Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5489)|
| 1:31:33| Well, it appears we have a major problem on our hands with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| But I want to thank you, Mr. Rojaro, for a good presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5497)|
| 1:31:41| and codes you're doing as much as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| You really need more people to try to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| But I wanted to ask you under your strategies and other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| and state the vacant property registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5512)|
| 1:31:56| I have a lot of vacant properties in my neighborhood, in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| And, Mr. Rojaro, if you or someone could elaborate on that a little more, the vacant property registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| David Massey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5528)|
| 1:32:09| I'm going to ask him to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| There are a number of cities around the country that have a vacant property registration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| This has occurred mainly in areas, the Rust Belt primarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5539)|
| 1:32:27| where vacancy has been a huge problem going on for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5547)|
| 1:32:35| Some of the ordinances basically, in an effort to get property owners to move on the property, fish or cut bait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5555)|
| 1:32:49| will assess a fee or a penalty for having a vacant property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5569)|
| 1:32:56| They do this on properties that are blight or a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5576)|
| 1:33:01| So there's a definition of whether it's a blight or a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5581)|
| 1:33:05| In the current economy, obviously, there are a lot of vacant properties that are well maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5585)|
| 1:33:12| These ordinances don't speak to those kinds of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5592)|
| 1:33:17| They're talking about properties that are blighted or a nuisance, a problem property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| In those ordinances, a fee is assessed, and they vary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5603)|
| 1:33:28| But in some of them, a fee is assessed, say, $500 the first year, $1,500 the second year, $4,000 the third year, and on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5608)|
| 1:33:38| At the recent Reclaiming Vacant Properties Conference that I went to in Cleveland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5618)|
| 1:33:44| there was one voice there expressing concern about those kinds of ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5624)|
| 1:33:50| because in most systems, if the fee is not paid, a lien is put on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5630)|
| 1:33:58| And then the problem becomes that it makes the property upside down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| just like some of the taxes on tax foreclosed properties that are still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| and even our own liens will make the property upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| So dealing with those things is yet another problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| So the issue is, how do we move owners of vacant property to fish or cut bait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5656)|
| 1:34:24| to do something with their property to fix them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| And I'm not sure that we are at a point where we could say that a vacant property ordinance is necessarily the best way to accomplish that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5667)|
| 1:34:39| It may be that figuring out some new tools for codes enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5679)|
| 1:34:47| such as what David Brace is talking about in terms of increased use of municipal court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| that those kinds of things may be a better tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5693)|
| 1:34:58| And if you'll permit me, I'll mention one other possible tool that we have there that is used in Memphis, and that's receivership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5698)|
| 1:35:07| And receivership basically is just a way a court can appoint a receiver to be in charge of someone's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5707)|
| 1:35:16| if that person is not keeping the property up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Usually it's the property has to be defined as a nuisance in places like in Memphis and Ohio and New York| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5719)|
| 1:35:28| and a few other states where these are actively pursued with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5728)|
| 1:35:35| It has to be kind of a last resort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5735)|
| 1:35:38| but basically the key tool there is that if a receiver is appointed, there's got to be money to be able to put into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5738)|
| 1:35:47| If it's not government money, it has to be some sort of private revolving loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5747)|
| 1:35:51| That takes place in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| But that money that's spent on the cure of the problem becomes a super priority lien over all other non-governmental liens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5755)|
| 1:36:07| They're doing it in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| Mayor Wharton just filed suit against 138 properties under the Neighborhood Preservation Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5769)|
| 1:36:18| which is an act of the Tennessee legislature which applies only to Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| But that may be a better tool, but even that one is something we have to assess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| Those are difficult to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| We're not at the point in the administration where we've figured out where those things go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| So vacant property ordinance looks good on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| As it works out on a practical matter, I'm not sure we're ready to assess whether or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| I'm certainly not, whether or not it's the effective tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| given the possibility that it simply puts a property upside down if you've got a vacant owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5810)|
| 1:36:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| Chad, you and Madeline, you've brought up several times the need for the necessity to make changes at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5819)|
| 1:37:09| Is this on the General Assembly's radar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5829)|
| 1:37:12| Is it on their agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| Where does this stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5834)|
| 1:37:17| Well, no, I don't think that we've developed an exact request or reduced that to a bill to say this is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5837)|
| 1:37:24| I think that we're at a point of discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| And, frankly, there are probably a long laundry list of legislative changes that are at least possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5846)|
| 1:37:32| But I think what, at least in our most recent meetings, we've identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5852)|
| 1:37:35| or agreed to identify, particularly the law folks, to sit down and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| here are the three or four things that we would like to focus on that we think would make a meaningful difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| and an immediate difference, rather than trying to do an overall thing that may result in some resistance in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5863)|
| 1:37:50| if you're trying to do an overhaul of the way we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| But some that would make a meaningful difference and whether those can be accomplished, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5872)|
| 1:37:58| in this next legislative session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| I think Doug said earlier that he had been talking to some of the title lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| I don't have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5884)|
| 1:38:05| I just thought that maybe that this discussion was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| Well, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| I can also say there actually have been some preliminary discussions with some of our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| And, you know, to let them know that we're working on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| You know, we just had the elections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| We're trying to assess what the political realities will be in Nashville for the next, just honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| what we're doing, what are likely to be, what can we likely accomplish in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5910)|
| 1:38:38| And so we're developing that strategy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Part of the strategy might be to let us know what the key issues are, specifics, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5921)|
| 1:38:47| we can talk to our legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| We'd appreciate that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| The one thing, the brief thing I will mention is that we've had representatives in our committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| who have come to our meetings regularly that are in the title insurance industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| in order to try to get input from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| So we're working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| Madeline, I think that's the key is to develop a strategy and let us know how we can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5943)|
| 1:39:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5950)|
| 1:39:11| I just want to follow back up on the amount of lots, the 8,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5951)|
| 1:39:15| I mean, I want to say, you know, we can't just say that they're not blighted and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5955)|
| 1:39:20| we just, okay, everything's good there because it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Those are really deep-rooted seeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| Because when you get out and actually drive around my district, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| which encompasses South Knoxville and Fort Sanders, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5970)|
| 1:39:33| I probably get equal amount of calls for lots that are overgrown and vermin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| and everything else that goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| So even though they may not be blighted now, it's certainly right on the cusp of becoming a real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| So even though it's not listed as blighted, it's right on the verge of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| And I'd say more times than not, it will end up in that category of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| So I just want to make sure that we're clear that it may not be on the list now, but it's certainly on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=5998)|
| 1:40:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| That's a huge number of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| It says to me, number one, that's a huge opportunity for potential redevelopment, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6007)|
| 1:40:12| to actually develop within the core of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6012)|
| 1:40:14| Not all individual lots are developable there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| But I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6018)|
| 1:40:20| If they're not vacant, I mean, if they're not blighted now, they could be in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6020)|
| 1:40:25| depending on what the ownership is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| Again, having the tools to be able to really identify the status of individual properties would be a real plus for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6029)|
| 1:40:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6042)|
| 1:40:43| Mr. De La Bope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6043)|
| 1:40:44| I want to hear from some of the members of the public, but I did have one more question, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| Mark Donaldson is here, and I don't know if MPC has any ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| I think he was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| If MPC has any, what, information they can provide us on what model codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6053)|
| 1:41:00| or other jurisdictions might be doing that tackle some of these problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6060)|
| 1:41:04| whether it's absentee landlords or blighted tracts or something that to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| And it may be that you hadn't had occasion to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| but I just thought you guys have the planning shtick, so you can bring that to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6072)|
| 1:41:20| In our work several years ago in relooking at definition of family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6080)|
| 1:41:26| we encountered many communities that did the apartment and rental property registrations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| but discovered that that's not a viable option here until state law changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6092)|
| 1:41:41| We have the ability to map and assist in preparing a strategy to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6101)|
| 1:41:49| We've seen the list of tools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6109)|
| 1:41:52| Most of them don't involve zoning or subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| It's getting boots on the ground and chasing property owners down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| And I know you've done some infill housing kind of guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| and housing types that can go in there, things that might be used when we get a vacant tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6127)|
| 1:42:12| or a tract that needs to be rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6132)|
| 1:42:14| We've been working on zoning, creation of new zoning districts that would create incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6134)|
| 1:42:22| for people to invest in property that might not be invested in under the current codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6142)|
| 1:42:30| So kind of to free up investment into properties that could be neglected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| or have been subject to disinvestment over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| Most of them involve creating opportunities for infill development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6165)|
| 1:42:51| that's consistent with the patterns that existed historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| Preserving the character kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6178)|
| 1:42:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6179)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| If I don't see any of the lights of council, I can move into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6181)|
| 1:43:06| First speaker of public forum is Sonny Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6186)|
| 1:43:10| Come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6190)|
| 1:43:11| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Please start out by giving us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6193)|
| 1:43:23| My name is Sonny Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| I live in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| I appreciate the opportunity to come here and speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6208)|
| 1:43:34| My concern is a very, very small piece of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6214)|
| 1:43:37| but it concerns a continuing situation with a property that is right across the alley from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6217)|
| 1:43:46| that can't seem to clean up its act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| It's a rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| The landlord does not seem to be able to impress on his tenants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| that they need to keep things dress right dress and cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6242)|
| 1:44:08| And the discussion tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| especially on the new tools and new strategies for local ordinance changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6251)|
| 1:44:19| sounds like a very good initiative to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6259)|
| 1:44:23| And I would just hope that the council can support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| and we can find ways to change our method of doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6267)|
| 1:44:35| So that's about all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| Have you been following up with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| Would David Grace know the property you're talking about, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| It might be worth just to communicate real quick and make sure that we know that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6287)|
| 1:44:51| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Next speaker is William Donegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| Come on down, state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6302)|
| 1:45:03| My name is William Donegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| I live at 5022 Chapman Highway, Apartment 205.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| I live in the South Woodlawn Neighborhood Association area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| I'm a member of the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I'm also on the Board of Governors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| And I'm actually supposed to be there in just a few minutes for a Board of Governors meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| so I need to be real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| There was an incident that happened recently in South Woodlawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6320)|
| 1:45:24| where a house that was not vacant but apparently was blighted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| came to the attention of the Neighborhood Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| and was spoken about frequently on the list serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| Apparently, they had an ongoing yard sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| They had lots of tables set up in the yard covered by blue tarps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6337)|
| 1:45:41| They had used mobile homes, appliances, vehicles for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6341)|
| 1:45:45| This caused a lot of upset in the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| What I want to bring to your attention is how the process unfolded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| Because, like in South Woodlawn, there's been conflict over certain issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| people will be slow to speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6357)|
| 1:45:59| And at first, there were some people that were very condemning of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| the supposed blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| But then after a while, someone finally spoke up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| and was concerned about the way the process was being managed by people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| that it was too harsh, that it was too confrontive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| And then slowly over time, other people spoke up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| yeah, you know, I kind of feel that way too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Maybe we should go over to talk to her and some things like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| And then at one point, the Neighborhood Association president, Janice Tolker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6382)|
| 1:46:27| and the vice president, Robert Marolino,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| agreed to go over and talk to the homeowner directly and in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6389)|
| 1:46:32| And right about that time when all this was supposed to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Councilman Pavlis was involved in all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6395)|
| 1:46:38| The city intervened and started the actual process that the city is involved with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| So what I wanted to bring to your attention was that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| I was observing the process that was going on in the background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6406)|
| 1:46:50| as people were gradually over time beginning to get personally involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| and wanted to intervene in a neighborly fashion in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| And that was what I wanted to bring to Madeline's attention too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| that this is actually another tool that hasn't been developed really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| that can be used in this whole process, the idea of neighborly intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6424)|
| 1:47:08| And that this was part of the idea behind the interest in the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6428)|
| 1:47:12| in the outgoing Mayor Haslam in Neighborhood Associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| that it would develop a sense of community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| And actually what I thought I observed happening was the actual city intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| stymied and even thwarted a little bit a neighborly intervention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6443)|
| 1:47:29| that could have helped in the overall development of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| association itself by people getting directly involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| It was very slow going at first because of the possibility of conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| and people being afraid to speak up because other people had stronger opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| and might condemn them or criticize them on the listserv.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| But gradually over time that process did begin to evolve a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6467)|
| 1:47:51| and then it was nipped in the bud when the city intervention actually came into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| So I thought that was just a really interesting aspect of the whole situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| And I want to say that, too, fully supportive of the efforts that you're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6479)|
| 1:48:03| to try and remedy blighted and vacant properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6483)|
| 1:48:08| But it was just an interesting observation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6488)|
| 1:48:11| So since I was here tonight, there you go, thank you, and I'm out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6491)|
| 1:48:14| Thank you, Mr. Donegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6494)|
| 1:48:16| Next signed up is Andy Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Come down, state your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6499)|
| 1:48:26| Yes, I'm Andy Ray, and property owner at 318 East Oklahoma Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6506)|
| 1:48:33| which actually is a lot that was sold at a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| That was a house that was condemned by the city and torn down in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| My husband and I purchased it last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6521)|
| 1:48:43| We are in the process of building an infill house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| Just real quick, everybody who's here about 326 East Oklahoma Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| if you'd like to stand, because we are not all signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| So this particular where we're building is a great neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6535)|
| 1:48:59| It's a great street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| There is one home that is wrecking everybody's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| We've been in communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| One of the young ladies back there has been trying to get help for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| The landlord owns six properties in 37917, has not paid taxes in four years on those properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6549)|
| 1:49:16| and owes the city and the county combined almost $20,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| That gentleman's name is Gary Dyer, D-Y-E-R.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| His wife's name is Shirlene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6563)|
| 1:49:25| Nobody's been using names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| I don't know why not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| I mean, this is public record, so if he's watching, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6568)|
| 1:49:33| I'm really appreciating the last little bit, a lot of the assistance that we've been getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6573)|
| 1:49:37| from the mayor's office and Chief Owen and Nick DeLaVolpe and on and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| The nuisance, I'm really glad the officer spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6583)|
| 1:49:45| That was a question I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6585)|
| 1:49:47| I'm going to try to research how many calls have been made on every single one of this landlord's properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| whether it's 911 or 311 or whatever, and compile that data and provide that to the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| I know there's a reason why it takes so long, I guess, to start collecting the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6599)|
| 1:50:04| I mean, nobody wants to have somebody's grandmother who's living in the home on fixed income put on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6604)|
| 1:50:11| But this is a classic case of that not being the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6611)|
| 1:50:15| I mean, these people don't even live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| They live out in Strawberry Plains, and they don't pay their taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| and I'm sure there are other properties or problems as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| So for whatever it takes at this point, I've heard that they've been placed on tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| whatever can be done to put pressure on these folks to take responsibility for their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| And the other question I have is, is there any way to get the media to do a story on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6636)|
| 1:50:41| is there any coordination, like I went on KGIS and found out all of these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| I don't think that the city, any office knew that they were, you know, that all of this was a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6646)|
| 1:50:51| that nobody was connecting the dots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6651)|
| 1:50:54| It just seems like there ought to be a way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6654)|
| 1:50:56| And I would love it if the media would do like the top, you know, don't pay their taxes every year, once a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| This is who owes what money, and I think that would help as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Thank you very much, Ms. Ray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| Final speaker signed up is Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6668)|
| 1:51:12| Come down, give us your name and address, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6672)|
| 1:51:16| Vice Mayor, can I make a statement right quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| Yes, I'm sorry, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| While she's coming, I wanted to tell you, young lady, I think, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6679)|
| 1:51:23| I know the Sentinel just did a story on that not too long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6683)|
| 1:51:27| They did a series on these properties and focused on the fact that there's a few people that own a lot of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6687)|
| 1:51:36| One particular person is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| They own many, many properties, and they just allow them to be run down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| That's a major problem in all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| I wish there was some way that we could put the squeeze on them, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Lauren Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Address is 229 East Scott Avenue in Old North Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6715)|
| 1:51:59| I'm here on behalf of Old North Knoxville as the president of our board of directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| Just kind of not going to really focus on one particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6725)|
| 1:52:08| We have over 800 residences in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| and I was able to count about eight vacant and problem properties out of 800 residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6730)|
| 1:52:17| That is not 800 properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6737)|
| 1:52:19| I don't have a total count of properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6739)|
| 1:52:21| And they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6741)|
| 1:52:22| They ruin whole streets, and with this particular property, they're ruining the street behind them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6742)|
| 1:52:27| because they're overflowing through the alley and in the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| And there's a couple of things that come to mind listening to some of the issues that have arisen here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6750)|
| 1:52:37| One of the problems or one of the thoughts is the neighborly intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6757)|
| 1:52:42| Yeah, I think that is a good idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| and we did try that one time with a problem commercial business in our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6764)|
| 1:52:49| where we sat down actually with Chief Sterling, our councilman Rob Frost, and Mayor Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6769)|
| 1:52:55| and that actually remedied a problem and has not been a problem anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6775)|
| 1:52:59| I think with 326 East Oklahoma, which is a problem property that's causing tons of problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| I would like to say if there's a way in part of this legislation, maybe some kind of mediation or intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6785)|
| 1:53:13| I think sometimes people are intimidated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Even though I'm the president of the organization, it's a little bit intimidating for me to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| hey, let me go talk to this problem landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| I did do that with a property around the corner from me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| and, well, it just ended up with the landlord and me hating each other's guts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| So we tried to be nice, but it didn't go very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| I think sometimes it needs maybe a neutral person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6813)|
| 1:53:36| I don't know if that's something that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6816)|
| 1:53:38| I'd hate to say to all of our councilmen, hey, let's go start scheduling all these meetings with these bad landlords| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6818)|
| 1:53:44| and see if we can get, you know, maybe there are too many of them if there are 700 properties to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6824)|
| 1:53:49| But if that's something that we could look at, maybe that's a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| Because with this particular problem property, we're getting reports of the tenants there being mentally retarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| and also having mental illnesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| And they're also reporting instances where they are being taken advantage of by the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| So they're not voicing their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| For instance, a cabinet fell off the wall and fell on one of their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| They supposedly asked the landlord to put it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| He didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| And then when one of our KPD officers was out there and asked them why the cabinet was on the porch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| they said it fell down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| They didn't say it fell down, it fell down on a child's head, and our landlord won't put it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6867)|
| 1:54:32| They don't have the means to be able to take care of their own problems and issues within that household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| And then on top of that, we have prostitution and drugs and all kinds of other problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| So it's really a big social problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| I almost wonder if we need a social worker to deal with some of these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6883)|
| 1:54:49| And then the other thing, and this ties back to this particular problem that we've used as an example here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6889)|
| 1:54:54| is we have very strong suspicions that if codes would be able to go in, they'd be able to condemn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6894)|
| 1:55:01| Unfortunately, we've worked with codes, and from the exterior they can't get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6901)|
| 1:55:05| The criteria is codes has to be invited in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| One property in my five years here that was condemned that way, the tenants invited codes in, and we got lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6908)|
| 1:55:15| It got condemned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6915)|
| 1:55:16| A flipper came in and flipped it, and now it's a nicer dwelling with a nice family in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| But that is a piece of our ordinances that impedes some of the things that we need to be changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| is codes must be invited in when you know and you have reports that there are feces on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6927)|
| 1:55:33| and cabinets falling off the wall and children's head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6933)|
| 1:55:35| but you can't get anybody in there without an invitation from the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| One other big property that one of my neighbors pointed out to me this morning that kind of triggers things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| it's like you know this, but you don't really put it into your mind until someone pointed it out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6947)|
| 1:55:54| The properties that are in disrepair actually have lower taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| That sounds logical, but I looked up, and we've got a vacant property in our neighborhood that has been so for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6959)|
| 1:56:05| The owner actually lives in the neighborhood, and he's just, if you want to buy it from him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| he'll sell it to you for $300,000, even though its value is well over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| But his taxes are half of what the neighboring similar property is next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6975)|
| 1:56:21| So it's like if I were to let my property go into disrepair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6981)|
| 1:56:25| and I were to board up my windows and stop mowing my grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6985)|
| 1:56:28| the next time the property assessor came through, they'd reduce my taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6988)|
| 1:56:31| And in turn, I'm reducing my neighbor's property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| I'm being rewarded for letting my property go into disrepair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6995)|
| 1:56:39| So some of these older neighborhoods, that's the problem we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| Somebody acquired the property on the cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| The taxes are cheap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| The taxes stay cheap because they keep the property looking bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| and there's no incentive to make it a nice property because they can keep it a cheap rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7008)|
| 1:56:53| They bought it for $8,000, and they pay $100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| And in closing, on the property that we were talking about that is arrears and taxes on all of his properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7016)|
| 1:57:03| a total of about $20,000 on multiple properties, the one that we're having problems with, the taxes are $250 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7023)|
| 1:57:10| And so he's behind about four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| You know, he could probably pay those out of one paycheck maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| But those are the issues we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Is there anything else to come before Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| Mr. DellaVoppe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| I was just wondering if Council could tell us if the ancient American tradition of tar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| and feathering is still permissible, maybe we could help some of these neighborhoods with problem properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| I think we don't need learning Council's opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| Excuse me, Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7063)|
| 1:57:44| I would like to recognize actually the mayor of Oak Ridge, Tom Behan, came here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7064)|
| 1:57:51| And I guess we talked about Oak Ridge, and we should have recognized you at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| Well, thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| Well, and Mr. DellaVoppe might have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Mr. Behan, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Please come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7083)|
| 1:58:06| Now, we appreciate you taking the time to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| And we did look at, at least some of us have looked at, the ordinance that Oak Ridge was working with last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| And you got to like mid-October, and you just kind of hit a wall with some resistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| And I guess your goal seemed to be to get some registration, some inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| and use those uniform property maintenance standards as a tool to kind of upgrade stuff that was running down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7105)|
| 1:58:32| I also want to, Catherine Baldwin, the Director of Community Development for the city, is with me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7112)|
| 1:58:37| And she does the day-to-day thing that Madeline does in our city and has spent a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| It's interesting because we have the same issues all across Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7124)|
| 1:58:48| And I met David, and he invited me to see some of the things that you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| And I asked Catherine to come because I think we can all learn from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7132)|
| 1:58:58| For instance, that legislation that only included Oak Ridge and Memphis, that was the only way we could get it passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7138)|
| 1:59:05| And I think it's time that the cities in Tennessee come together on these issues as a whole and put a legislative package together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7145)|
| 1:59:13| Again, it won't be one size that fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| That's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7156)|
| 1:59:17| But there's a lot of similarities and things we can do together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| And sitting here tonight, it was very interesting to hear the same issues that I hear in our city council room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7160)|
| 1:59:27| Almost weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| And we had an interesting, I think we just had an event with one of your landlords about 4 o'clock in Oak Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7169)|
| 1:59:37| where the zoning board, the building board of adjustments has declared that they're going to demolish his buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7177)|
| 1:59:46| And I think he's a friend of yours also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7186)|
| 1:59:48| He's probably on your list someplace several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| I won't use his name, but do you know his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7192)|
| 1:59:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7195)|
| 1:59:57| I think Madeline hit the part about the registration and the fact that we got the ordinance passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7197)|
| 2:00:03| but administering that is going to be more, I think you hit the nail on the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| And Catherine, would you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| Catherine's the one that said, wait a minute, you've got to slow down a little bit on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| But we're using all kinds of things that are similar to what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7214)|
| 2:00:19| And I think that one of the strengths we could do is to sit down together as cities across Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| because this is not an isolated situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| Anyway, thank you for the recognition and letting us sit here and learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7230)|
| 2:00:35| I wonder if you could mention, did you meet a lot of resistance in trying to pass it locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7235)|
| 2:00:39| or just decided you needed state enabling legislation to kind of get it done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| We needed the state enabling legislation, and we have a lobbyist who we commissioned to go down and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7243)|
| 2:00:50| And he went there, and he found that there was pushback, and we couldn't get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7250)|
| 2:00:57| So we narrowed it to Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| So you had a more localized authorization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| Which is too bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7262)|
| 2:01:04| I think the communities, because of the real estate issues that are going on all across America,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7264)|
| 2:01:10| I think that, and David talked about the workshops that he's gone to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7270)|
| 2:01:15| I think there's a moment in history right now where cities are tired of slumlords that degradate communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7275)|
| 2:01:23| that cause crime issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| And we're willing, I think, to bring a lot to bear on these types of situations in cities in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7286)|
| 2:01:34| We can't stand it anymore, and I applaud what I heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7294)|
| 2:01:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7299)|
| 2:01:40| I'm going to say that, you know, the first slide we had, I don't know if you noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| that the house in North Knoxville, the owner has about 13 properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| and he's $109,000 in arrears in city and county taxes, and he waits until you sue him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7307)|
| 2:01:52| and then he pays up, and then he waits four more years and kind of waits you out and just plays with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7312)|
| 2:01:57| They're a problem folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7319)|
| 2:02:00| Well, Mr. Bloom, thanks for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7320)|
| 2:02:02| It sounds like there might be a Knoxville, Knox County, Oak Ridge task force at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| It might be a great idea to make things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7327)|
| 2:02:10| I don't see any of your lights, and it is 7 o'clock, so I'm going to just say we're adjourned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7330)|
| 2:02:15| and everybody have a safe night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877101111?start=7335)|
