| 0:00:00| According to the clock on the wall, it is now 4 o'clock and we will open up this commission discussion on the safety center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=0)|
| 0:00:11| The only actual official committee folks that are on the commission here are Randy Jeff and myself and Amy, but she's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=11)|
| 0:00:28| We don't have any minutes from the previous meeting to discuss what we do, kind of, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=28)|
| 0:00:40| I think this really just needs to be a general discussion today and kind of bring everybody up to date on where the committee is and where we are totally in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=40)|
| 0:00:52| About 10 days ago, we had a meeting and there was probably almost 30 people, I guess, showed up, several citizens, as well as some elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=52)|
| 0:01:06| Randy and Jeff and myself represented the commission. Chris Budd was here representing the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=66)|
| 0:01:12| General Allen was here. Ex-General Nichols, Lee Trammell, I see they're all here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=72)|
| 0:01:20| There might be one or two others that were here that I don't recognize at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=80)|
| 0:01:27| But we just want to kind of give you an update of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=87)|
| 0:01:31| The only thing that was voted on that day, and let me preface that by saying this, if you remember last meeting, this committee was to have a 30-day lifespan to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=91)|
| 0:01:44| So what we need to do today is decide how we want to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| And I've got some suggestions after talking with some of the elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| I couldn't talk to Randy and Jeff, of course, but with Charm and Randy and Lee, Hugh Hope, the mayor, we've got some suggestions on where we can go forth and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=115)|
| 0:02:11| The only vote that was taken that day was I was elected chairman, and I guess that will have to be done again since this committee sunsets in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=131)|
| 0:02:20| We had set the next meeting to be the 26th here, but this room and the small room are both taken up by the election commission for training that Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=140)|
| 0:02:37| We next moved to a Monday, the 29th, and I talked to the mayor this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=157)|
| 0:02:45| Things are moving pretty quickly, and we've got to be kind of flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=165)|
| 0:02:48| We'd set for the 29th, but he and the sheriff's department are going to Nashville within the next week to talk to the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=168)|
| 0:03:01| And hopefully we will have something more concrete for the committee to work on within the next couple of weeks after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=181)|
| 0:03:11| So I'd like to move that meeting to March 14th at 1 o'clock and be in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| We'll be March 14th at 1 o'clock here for the safety committee meeting of which I'd like to make a proposal based on talking with those I just mentioned a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=199)|
| 0:03:35| You get too big a committee, then you wind up spending all your time talking and never getting anything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=215)|
| 0:03:41| So this is what we've come up with, being myself, Randy and Jeff from commission, General Allen, Randy Nichols, Lee Trammell from the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=221)|
| 0:03:54| two council people, representatives from KPD, both mayor's offices, which I've already talked to Bill Lyon, and I thought he might be down today, but I don't see him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=234)|
| 0:04:08| and Miss Vivian Schott and Burt Rosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| There were others at the meeting that will have some input into this, but it was felt that we need to keep this committee small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=253)|
| 0:04:21| and as these other folks are needed, their expertise is needed, the committee can bring them in for a particular meeting to discuss that particular angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=261)|
| 0:04:33| That's kind of where we are at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| I can give you the suggested, I just gave you the names on the suggested committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=278)|
| 0:04:45| What's yours feeling on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| Sam, you got your light on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=287)|
| 0:04:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair, and I guess my only suggestion, even though I know she's been under the weather, but with the only facility being in her district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=289)|
| 0:04:59| I think it would be, you know, again, I don't know if she's able to make it, but I think it would be good to have Amy on that body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| and it may not end up in the second district, but the only facility that had been named during this whole dialogue happened to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| it was somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| In the third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Okay, well, second and third districts all have facilities named, so I think it would be good to have her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| Well, there's no reason that any of the 11 can't come, or any of the nine council people can't come and sit in on the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| but we're talking about keeping the committee as small as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| I'd like to go even one step further for an executive committee, which would be the ones that would be meeting off-chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=334)|
| 0:05:43| you know, off-days from the regular meeting, because it takes an act of Congress and dispensation from the Pope to have a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=343)|
| 0:05:52| So with a committee meeting, we can do that on a 48-hour notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| So that would be one commission member, General Allen, Randy Nichols, Lee Trammell, one council person, one KPD person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=359)|
| 0:06:15| and Vivian Scheib, and then a representative from the mayor's office, but they may, as I talked to Mayor Rojero on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=375)|
| 0:06:24| she may want to appoint the council person or the KPD person as her representative, so that's up to the mayors what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=384)|
| 0:06:32| But they do want to be kept in the loop on it, and that's kind of where we are on that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=392)|
| 0:06:40| So what's the feeling of the rest of the group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| Oh, go ahead, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=407)|
| 0:06:49| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I'm all for that date and for what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| I remember reading something where, I think it was your committee that told Hugh Holt to do some exploratory work, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=414)|
| 0:07:03| Well, I'm sure he's probably been on it, has been in on it, but General Nichols and Andy Black,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=423)|
| 0:07:13| who is on contract right now until June with Helen Ross McNabb, have been working on this thing every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| They've researched it from A to Z and backwards and forwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| They're putting together information on it, and my understanding is that the mayor's office will probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=445)|
| 0:07:36| to get around the conflict of interest issue, which it would be if Helen Ross McNabb is a bidder and Andy's on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| That's why I didn't announce him on the committee, that the mayor is considering hiring him as a consultant to the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=465)|
| 0:07:54| which would be outside the committee purview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=474)|
| 0:08:00| So once they get back from Nashville, we have some idea on what the state intends to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=480)|
| 0:08:08| Then it would come back to this committee again to make a recommendation to all parties involved of how we would go further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=488)|
| 0:08:16| And at that time, do you think we'd be setting a date to achieve these goals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| At that point, I think we'll be ready to send out for the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| There you go. Okay, that's what I was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| Based on what I've been told, when they come back from Nashville, Lee, you may know more about this than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=507)|
| 0:08:33| but they pretty well got a proposal put together on tentatively what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=513)|
| 0:08:43| So it'll be a matter of just refining that through the committee or whatever, through the consultant, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=523)|
| 0:08:53| Has the committee received any opposition anywhere in this process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| No. As a matter of fact, it's been the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=537)|
| 0:09:00| As I say, we had about 30 people up there, and over half of them were citizens, and they were all in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| And we've gotten a couple, three emails from people in support of it as commissioners, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| So I think the time is right to strike while the iron is hot, and I think that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=554)|
| 0:09:22| That's good news. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| Yeah, I'm glad you brought up the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| It was actually this body, not the committee, but the full commission that set out for the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=567)|
| 0:09:37| And I think we discussed that in our first committee meeting that I don't think we're ready for the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| I think it's something that we should probably table until we can get a grasp on what we want it to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| So when we draft that, it's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| And that was kind of the consensus that we got from everybody in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| I do want to serve on the committee, and any executive committee, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=597)|
| 0:10:05| because I think this is something very important that we need to see through, and we need to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| So if it means slowing down and looking at it for over the next six months, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| That's what we need to do so we can get it right from the get-go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| I think this committee needs to be extended longer than 30 days, because it's not something that's going to be done next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| Well, I'm assuming that we can make that—this meeting can make that recommendation to the commission at the coming-up work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=628)|
| 0:10:37| Well, I'd be in favor of making that recommendation to the full commission that we extend our—with not a date foreseen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=637)|
| 0:10:47| I don't want to put a timetable on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=647)|
| 0:10:49| Well, there's a good possibility, I think, that we could possibly—you can tell me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=649)|
| 0:10:56| but you think it's possible that maybe April, no later than May, we might be ready to shoot out for an RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=656)|
| 0:11:08| Yeah, basically what I need is a scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| Just to plug into it, we already have a boilerplate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| We've done this exercise once before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| I'm assuming some of our thoughts have changed on how we approach it, but yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=679)|
| 0:11:30| it won't take me more than a couple of weeks once we get a scope of work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| and I push it back out to everybody to look at before we issue it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=693)|
| 0:11:39| Well, the—all of you got a copy if you—a 62-page report on the last RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=699)|
| 0:11:47| If you look through it, you saw on page 8 it starts out with a qualified program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| and it outlines the next seven or eight pages basically what the program would be involving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=713)|
| 0:12:01| but we still need to see what's coming back from Nashville before we can dovetail the two together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| and I think that's going to be the work of the executive committee rather than the whole committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=727)|
| 0:12:16| and bring that to the whole committee and then back to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| That's my timetable on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Is anybody else different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Mr. Smith, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| Hugh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| Yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| When looking for a service like this, is it best to keep the scope of work fairly broad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| get your service provider, and then work details out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| Yeah, I mean, that's logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| I mean, the broader the scope, the more people you can include in the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| and sometimes when you do that, you get a different look or a different approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=771)|
| 0:12:57| that you never thought of from the beginning, but yeah, that is an opportunity that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=785)|
| 0:13:07| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| Just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| You said we're going to have a meeting on March the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=790)|
| 0:13:14| Was there a time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| One o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| One o'clock, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Now, what are we looking to accomplish between now and then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Hopefully, we will have something back from Nashville that the executive committee of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| committee can be poring over and make some recommendations to that committee on that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=809)|
| 0:13:36| So, on the 14th, before the 14th, will we have a chance to look at it before we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=816)|
| 0:13:48| We'll disseminate out as much of it as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| We have a little bit of a problem in minutes of the meeting getting out to everybody until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=830)|
| 0:13:58| they're approved by the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| So, in other words, Ms. Angie can't send them out until the commission minute notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| until they've been approved by the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| So, it's kind of who comes first, the chicken or the egg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| You can't approve if you don't see them first, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=853)|
| 0:14:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| But that's been the rule, and she goes by the rules, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| I tried to twist her arm and I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=864)|
| 0:14:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Who sent them to the membership for approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=865)|
| 0:14:28| She can send it to the membership for approval, the committee members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| And I had another thought there that got by me a minute ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=876)|
| 0:14:48| Does anybody have any heartburn with any of these that we're talking about for the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=888)|
| 0:14:55| committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Somebody want to make a motion that we present this list as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=898)|
| 0:15:03| There's a couple of blanks, but the departments are there to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| Mr. Chair, I make a motion that we submit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| And is this also in your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=912)|
| 0:15:14| It has to be a committee member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=914)|
| 0:15:15| Oh, it has to be a committee member from one of the two guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=915)|
| 0:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Before you do that, let's see what Commissioner John has to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Is that your line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| It's my line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=925)|
| 0:15:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=926)|
| 0:15:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| I'm not used to sitting in this seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| I make a motion that we accept the names for the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=929)|
| 0:15:34| as well as keeping Commissioner Brown as our chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=934)|
| 0:15:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=941)|
| 0:15:43| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=945)|
| 0:15:45| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=945)|
| 0:15:47| I guess that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| Now for the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=952)|
| 0:15:53| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=953)|
| 0:15:53| I'd like to make another motion that we extend this committee to an undesignated date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=953)|
| 0:16:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=962)|
| 0:16:03| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| Now we need to define this executive committee, and we probably need to go over them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| As I said, it needs to be one commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| General Allen, Randy Nichols, Lee Trammell, one council person, KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=978)|
| 0:16:27| mayor's office, Ms. Vivian Schaap, and Burt Rosen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=987)|
| 0:16:39| I'd like to be that commissioner first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Sam has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1000)|
| 0:16:42| Sam has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Is Randy representing the sheriff's department, or should that be a separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Yes, he is representing the sheriff's department on a consulting basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1009)|
| 0:16:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1019)|
| 0:16:59| Motion moved that that would be the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Do I hear a motion that these motions be forwarded to the whole commission for a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1035)|
| 0:17:16| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1036)|
| 0:17:19| At any time, those of you that are sitting around the table up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| or any of you that are out there that have information that you would like to have input into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| you've heard the names of those that are going to be working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Most of you know at least two or three of those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| and I strongly urge you to get in touch with them or me to get your questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1057)|
| 0:17:47| If we can't answer them, we'll try to get you an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| Or if you've got some ideas, we'll run them up the flagpole and see who salutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| But as I said, it's been moving pretty fast these last couple of days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| and I strongly believe that once the mayor and the sheriff come back from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| that we will be well on our road to getting some real concrete stuff done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| We've been talking about this now for four years, five years, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| We actually had an RFP two years ago, and we let it lay and die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| But we've got a basis there to work from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| And I would encourage you, if you haven't looked at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| to go back through them and read those pages 8 through 15 or whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| And also, last commission meeting, Ms. Vivian passed out a sheet that looked like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1111)|
| 0:18:43| it said Stepping Up Initiative, a national initiative to reduce the number of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1123)|
| 0:18:48| with mental illness in jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| The last page she had on that was a proclamation that she wanted the commissioners to sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| But I'd like to draw your attention to the bottom of the page where she had several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| ideas on what could be done and should be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1140)|
| 0:19:02| and they follow right along with what we've been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| So she's got some good ideas, and that's one reason I wanted her on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| because I think she can help us a lot in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| So is there anything further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Any commissioners have questions or anything that you would like to ask of this committee before we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1158)|
| 0:19:26| And we will try, while you're thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| As soon as we get information back, I can assure you that within 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| that executive committee will be meeting and trying to get as much stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| as we can get together for the meeting on the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| Yes, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Yes, Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| I just wanted to tell you, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| I sat in the meeting, and Randy was there as well, upstairs a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| And, you know, I just commend you on the job you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| I thought you did a great job, and I think that was a great meeting, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| A lot of good ideas come from there, but we've got to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| obviously, a lot of those meetings, and I think we're moving in a good direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Well, as I said a while ago, I think before you got here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| this committee is not all of the folks that will be working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| As they come to a particular spot that needs XYZ expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1215)|
| 0:20:20| they will pull in that person from XYZ to help them with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| So it will be a fluctuating committee with experts brought in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1225)|
| 0:20:29| and somebody mentioned that, I think, a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| from every angle and every nook and cranny that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1231)|
| 0:20:36| We want to get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1236)|
| 0:20:38| Also, Randy Nichols is waiting for information from the one in San Antonio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1238)|
| 0:20:44| It's been up about 10 years, because they put a lot of money into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| But they have a good track record with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| We want to know where they started and how they started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| and how they built on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| That's where we want to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| So who's first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| Randy, you first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Excuse me, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| I guess I just want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| This is an easy subject to just say, yes, let's all get on board and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1268)|
| 0:21:14| But this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| It's very complicated, has a lot of moving pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| and I hope all of you all will do as much research as you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| and ask the really tough questions that are going to need to be asked for this to work right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1283)|
| 0:21:31| John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Thank you, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| So the trip to Nashville, once the Mayor and Chief Deputy Trammell comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| we'll have an understanding of what the state's funding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| kind of a hard number at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| Is that the goal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1309)|
| 0:21:50| And my understanding is that they have already put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1310)|
| 0:21:55| some framework for a proposal that they will hammer out with him also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1315)|
| 0:22:01| And this could possibly be a pilot program for the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1321)|
| 0:22:09| and if so, you've got to believe that the Governor will put everything he's got behind it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| to make sure it's a success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| So I feel good about that from that angle, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Randy brought up a good point, that dotting the I's and crossing the T's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Several things were brought up at that meeting 10 days ago, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| about the different people who could and would be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| And the list is not just a handful of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1353)|
| 0:22:37| The list might be 15 or more resources that this center will use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1357)|
| 0:22:44| to be able to handle these folks that come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1364)|
| 0:22:47| They'll be triaged, some sort of a diagnosis in the triage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| and sent to the proper person, department, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| that will be germane to their particular illness or problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| And it may be that they get, in probably 95% of cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1384)|
| 0:23:09| they are going to get referred out to some outside help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| But right now, as Lee Trammell has stood up before here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| forced many times and said, you know, bring them into the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| We keep them 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| We give them a handful of pills and put them back on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1402)|
| 0:23:25| Two days later, we go pick them up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| So it's been kind of revolving to a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and that creates a huge problem for society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| So Mr. Nichols and Ms. Charm, Lee, do you all three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| one of you all have anything you want to add to the discussion here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| I think you've done very good, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| I wouldn't have anything further to add if you're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1427)|
| 0:24:01| When we had our original discussion about the committee members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| we had talked about having a representative from the Public Defender's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| specifically Dr. Roger Noe, who is very knowledgeable in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| I just want to make sure, is he on the list, the big committee list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| He will be now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| As long as that's agreeable with the other two commissioners to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| Well, you said we would add what we needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| So I'm glad you brought that up because I'd forgotten to write it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Randy had it on his list, but it didn't make it to mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| Lee, I saw you there somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1473)|
| 0:24:40| Yes, sir, while we're waiting on Lee, you want to make a comment, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| My name is Buddy Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I live in Knox County, 308 Hidden Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| I represent me and my dog, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| I just want to praise you and thank you for your leadership on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| These people cannot speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| They have to have champions with citizens, have to champion them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| I grew up in West Tennessee chopping and picking cotton by hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1509)|
| 0:25:13| My father was a paranoid schizophrenic, and four times as I was growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| he went to Western State and rebuilt his life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| Well, there is help for these people to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| They have to have a bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1527)|
| 0:25:28| They have to have medical help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Then they can rebuild their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| The families can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| The families don't cause it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| The families can't cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1534)|
| 0:25:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1536)|
| 0:25:36| Be their champion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| One thing we need to keep, Lee said he was foregoing his comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| let me just make this for the press and the public that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| This doesn't come free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| We probably right now have enough promise to get it started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| but you got to have running money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| So somewhere down the line, you know, the citizens are going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| you want this, you're going to have to kind of step up too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| And whatever it takes, whether it's volunteering with your time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| your money or what have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1568)|
| 0:26:10| it's going to take the whole village to make this thing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| So just kind of keep that in mind as we go forward on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| Anything else, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| If not, we, this committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1584)|
| 0:26:25| Do you want to go ahead and make a motion to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| Add the other person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| Do you want to make a motion to add Sean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Roger, no, go ahead Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| Roger, add Roger Noe to the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| What are we adding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| To both lists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| Yes, I make a motion that we accept both lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Okay, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| All right, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1610)|
| 0:26:51| He's officially on Noe, the way you spell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| If nothing else, we stand adjourned to this meeting until workshop at five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom160216SafetyCenter?start=1614)|
