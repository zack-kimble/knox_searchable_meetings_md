| 0:01:11| Thank you. I don't see any elected officials out there. Am I missing anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=71)|
| 0:01:16| Seen none. If you all...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=76)|
| 0:01:19| We have Vice Mayor Farragut here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=79)|
| 0:01:22| Where are you? I see. Welcome. Welcome, Vice Mayor Farragut. I'm sorry, I didn't see you out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=82)|
| 0:01:32| All right. If you all would please stand, salute the flag, I'll lead us in the pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=92)|
| 0:01:42| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=102)|
| 0:01:50| one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=110)|
| 0:02:03| I thank you all for being here. Just as a brief introduction and an order of business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=123)|
| 0:02:09| we are going to start out with public forum. Each speaker will be given three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| My Vice Chair, Gina Oster, will be keeping the time, and when it gets down to about 30 seconds before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=134)|
| 0:02:24| she'll give you a wave or a nod. So forgive that we can't put it on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| We don't have the ability in this small assembly room to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=151)|
| 0:02:36| After public forum is completed, we're going to move on to presentations regarding the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=156)|
| 0:02:44| to be given by various individuals, and then from that, we will move on to our public workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=164)|
| 0:02:53| At that point, there will be no additional opportunity to speak or to ask any questions from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| So please keep that in mind. Board members, do you have any questions about the format that we're going to be using?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=181)|
| 0:03:10| I do, Madam Chair. Had the Chair considered moving item numbers 4 and 5 to 5 and 4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=190)|
| 0:03:20| In other words, switch those to have the presentation first before the public addresses us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| so that if some of the questions that the public may have in their public forum comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| would be maybe alleviated after the presentation is given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=212)|
| 0:03:38| I had actually thought about that. I believe, without objection, I'm going to keep the order as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=218)|
| 0:03:47| All right. Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| Seeing none, we'll move on to public forum. First speaker to sign up is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=231)|
| 0:03:58| Speakers, when you come forward, if you would give your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=238)|
| 0:04:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. Kevin Murphy, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| If you boil down all the feedback from public input, you'll uncover four really major themes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=258)|
| 0:04:25| A need for more housing, a desire to protect rural character and agriculture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| better integration with our schools with all the growth that's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=269)|
| 0:04:33| and doing this in a fiscally responsible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| The plan really delivers on number one and number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=276)|
| 0:04:40| It proposes new development place types that are aligned for more dense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| It puts those in areas where there's good infrastructure that's in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| and encourages that development to flow into those areas so we can have higher density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| more fiscal responsibility, better able to service that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| And I understand that it's an action item and that there's been some steps to improve the communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| of the schools with the county and with planning regarding growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| There's been really good progress on numbers one, two, three, and four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| But protecting number two, protecting rural character and agriculture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| That's the one where there's some calls for some action, but we're really looking for some teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=320)|
| 0:05:27| Last week I went to a forum on growth and challenges in Middle Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| It was called by MTSU, their planning department, and their top three issues are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=331)|
| 0:05:37| one, their landfill is about to fill up, so they're really concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| Two, traffic congestion across their nine-county region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=341)|
| 0:05:45| And three, the loss of farmland and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Williamson County, they took the lead back in 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| They updated their comprehensive plan, and they made some significant progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| on adopting a growth framework for their county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| The other counties over there, they all were there, and they expressed a lot of interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| Rutherford County and Montgomery County are currently updating their comprehensive plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| and this is one of their top priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=372)|
| 0:06:15| We in Knox County, we've had plans for more than 20 years calling for protection of rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=375)|
| 0:06:20| That's in the handout that I've given to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| It's in our 2003 general plan, which calls for conservation subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| Each of our sector plans, including the central city sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| call for adopting a conservation subdivision ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| The Hillside and Ridgetop Protection Plan, which was adopted by the commission in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| it has a model conservation subdivision ordinance as an appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| It's all there, ready to be adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| We even had an open space reserved in the subdivision regulation for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| but none of that's ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=414)|
| 0:06:56| We have promises made and actions called for, but never kept,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| and that's probably what's eroded the community's trust in the framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| So the plan that's in front of you, we ask that it take concrete steps to restore that trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| If there are decisions and policies you can put in place now that have teeth and that are enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=439)|
| 0:07:20| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=446)|
| 0:07:37| If Sandra Korbelick would come forward, we might just play with this mic a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| and see what needs to happen up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=462)|
| 0:07:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| Perhaps if you could pull it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| I'm a loud speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=473)|
| 0:07:55| No, it isn't, is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=475)|
| 0:08:02| Do we not have IT in here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=482)|
| 0:08:18| The brave men of the 4th Brigade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=498)|
| 0:08:23| I think, have we got it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=503)|
| 0:08:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| Now you may need to move back a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Oh, it sounds like we've all gotten louder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=512)|
| 0:08:34| Your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| I'm Sandra Korbelick, and congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| You have the name right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Chair Hill and commissioners, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| There are good things to be discussed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| but when it comes to protecting our natural resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| you will be adopting a proposal that is ineffective and outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| We know that protecting our natural resources is a major concern of your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| We know that through Advanced Knox and the East Tennessee Realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| Association survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=545)|
| 0:09:08| that protecting natural resources has been a primary concern of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=548)|
| 0:09:12| community and is a goal in the grass comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| But, as my grandma said, the proof is in the pudding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| And that means you don't know how well it tastes until you eat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| Let's judge the value of this goal by how well it's defined in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| specific implementation policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| One, it's very narrowly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| Threatened and endangered species, and Knox County has several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| Water quality, storm water control, wildlife habitat, and corridors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| riparian buffers, unique features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=589)|
| 0:09:52| These are not mentioned in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=592)|
| 0:09:54| Two, except for steep slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| there is no public map showing natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| You can't protect what you don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=601)|
| 0:10:04| Three, there is no call for open space natural resource plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| This would allow us to understand which features have more value than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| others and how they interconnect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Our ecology interconnects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| Four, many Tennessee counties are much more advanced in recognizing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| protecting natural resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| And there are opportunities for protection that are not mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=627)|

| 0:19:20| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| I'm Gerald Thornton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| I live in Farragut in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| I represent the Harvey Grimm Group of the Sierra Club,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| and we appreciate all the effort that you all are putting into this general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1168)|
| 0:19:33| planning effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| However, we urge you to make some significant changes to the draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| comprehensive land use and transportation plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| because the draft plan, if adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| does not really impose any limitations on what Knox County Commission can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| when it revises the zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| which is where the policies in the plan will become enforceable law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| The plan should not just be a series of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| It should say, this is what the county will do as a matter of law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1199)|
| 0:20:03| and then the zoning ordinance should follow from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| Further, the draft plan does not fully reflect all of the community's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| Specifically, the conservation of farmland, open space, wetlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| hillsides, and ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| and affordable housing were among the priorities established through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| advanced Knox process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| but these priorities are not reflected in the draft comprehensive plan or in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| the amended growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| Where the comprehensive plan is defective or deficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| those problems should be resolved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| and the growth policy plan should be derived from the revised comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:39| For instance, in chapter three, under implementation item seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1239)|
| 0:20:42| the plan talks about preserving forest wildlife habitats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| but does not require any particular places to be protected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| and does not identify any wildlife migration corridors for protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Although the draft plan identifies park deserts throughout the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| under implementation item 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| it does not identify any specific places where parks will or should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| In our opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| the draft plan designates too much land for planned growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| reducing the rural areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| particularly in the Gibbs and Rita areas of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| Since the plan will be reviewed and amended occasionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| five to 10 years, depending on when the winners need to revise it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| it would be prudent to reduce the planned growth areas now and expand them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1284)|
| 0:21:29| later only if time proves a need for more expansive development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| The draft plan does not impose a housing density limit on the designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| We recommend that plans specify a density of no more than one housing unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| per acre in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| The proposed plan appears to envision urban, suburban,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1305)|
| 0:21:49| and rural areas designed to accommodate transportation only by individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1314)|
| 0:21:55| This concept is obsolete and has been shown in numerous instances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1315)|

| 0:22:03| Any comprehensive land use and transportation plan needs to account for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| impacts of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| which are primarily caused by the transportation sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| The plan doesn't consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1334)|
| 0:22:16| There's no focus on the role of public transportation in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:21| The plan should require that the road improvements identified in the draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1341)|
| 0:22:26| plan and all needed infrastructure improvements be completed before new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1346)|

| 0:23:43| Thank you, Madam chair, Wolf Negley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Knox County speaking on behalf of the foundation for global| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| sustainability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| When I signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| I had to declare whether I'm for, against, or neutral on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| And I think that's not very suitable for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| I can easily state that I applied for all three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| but there were only radio buttons, not checkboxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| So I would like to commend all the commissioners for actually making the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| restriction on the adoption of the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| that it will be in effect only if the comprehensive plan gets adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1462)|
| 0:24:29| And I think the growth plan needs to be updated and improved as much as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:35| this comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And I'm not going to repeat what all my previous speakers have already said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1478)|
| 0:24:42| I agree with everything they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| It's very important that you consider all these conditions and concerns of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1484)|
| 0:24:50| citizenship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| Climate change is not mentioned at all in this comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:58| So it's not comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1498)|
| 0:25:00| You have the obligation to look forward and to be not narrow-minded on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| particular topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| but to consider everything holistically and how it could turn out in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| And I think the growth plan is taking a great land grab from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1513)|
| 0:25:19| agricultural land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| And if you look at the climate change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| really it's accelerating every successive IPCC report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| It's rising its projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1530)|
| 0:25:33| The worst projections are becoming the most likely or more probable now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:39| So it's accelerating more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| And as we've seen with other crises that are going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| climate change is really causing a lot of these problems that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| experiencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| A lot of people just don't recognize it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| that housing prices like climate change has caused a lot of tree from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1556)|
| 0:26:04| wildfires and the infection of pests in Canada,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1564)|
| 0:26:12| for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:13| The lumber industry has been very heavily diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| And so the prices of lumber have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| And a lot of other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| cost of living in general have gone up in tandem with climate change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| impacts that make everything more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1585)|
| 0:26:28| And we can't really change that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| but we have to deal with it and we have to expect it and we need to plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:34| for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| And the big problem with the comprehensive plan is that it has not done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1595)|
| 0:26:39| any policy assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| What would happen if the trajectory of the predictions of the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:47| projections are not turning out as it was said in the beginning of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| It's very likely that we could have more or less growth in population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1614)|
| 0:27:00| And agriculture, of course, is an important part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| And when you give away a lot of agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1625)|
| 0:27:07| you have to think about seven generations ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| And so this is just too big a chunk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| I think the growth plan needs to be done in smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| like two-year steps or three-year steps that was mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1636)|
| 0:27:19| but it's never been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And so we shouldn't just take such a big wrap at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:25| Could you wrap it up, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| So, yeah, we'll probably get some atmospheric river coming to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| and it will devastate a lot of areas that we haven't even thought of being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:38| And as was said before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| there hasn't been enough investigation into the property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:47| not just for development, but in terms of biodiversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:52| the natural resources, and the ecosystem services that we receive from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1681)|
| 0:28:04| I appreciate very much the time that each of you have taken to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1684)|
| 0:28:09| and still comment on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Thank you so much for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1692)|
| 0:28:19| We're going to move on now to the comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| and transportation plan presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| I understand that we have three speakers here from Kimberly Horn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| and Allison Flute, Christina Whitefield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| and Michael Curtis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1717)|
| 0:28:40| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| We appreciate you all coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| And if you'd like to begin in your order, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1723)|
| 0:28:51| Just straighten this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| Can you all hear me okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| Making sure I'm not blowing anybody out of the water here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1735)|
| 0:29:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you very much for the chance to present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| I am Allison Flute with Kimberly Horn and Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and I'm very happy to be back in front of the commission again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| So we wanted to just provide you an overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1754)|
| 0:29:19| You all have had the opportunity since this plan started in November of 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| to hear from us several times as well as staff about the planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| some of the conclusions that have been reached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| and then more recently some of the revisions that are being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| as a part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| So we do want to provide a brief overview of that prior to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1779)|
| 0:29:43| having the opportunity to ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| Just to set the stage as a reminder, for the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| this is really something that we see as a necessary first step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1791)|
| 0:29:58| The comprehensive plan is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| It's a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| It is not something that's controlling our zoning decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| but it is setting the stage for the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| So for today, I'm going to give you a little bit of information on our plan's background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| and relationship to the larger planning process that we undertake here within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| And then Michael Curtis from Planning Next is going to tell us a little bit more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| the comprehensive plan and some of the implementation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| as well as Christina Whitfield giving us some of the perspective on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| So first, what's the impetus for this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| Why is this update so important?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| So one of the big things that drove the creation and the outset of this planning process is time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:54| The currently adopted comprehensive plan is nearly 20 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| So this has been a planning process that is a long time in the making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| There has not been another cohesive planning process that intentionally marries land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| and transportation together that has been done within the county, within that 20-year interval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| And beyond that, we see incredible growth coming to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| You have seen some of that growth already manifesting itself here within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| and by 2045, the projections within the county are that we're going to add an additional 105,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1887)|
| 0:31:36| And so certainly the time is right to be more intentional about how we can plan for that growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1896)|
| 0:31:42| and make fiscally responsible decisions from a land use and transportation perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1902)|
| 0:31:50| So at the outset of this planning process, we talked with staff, we talked with the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| to understand what we were hoping to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| And this was a conversation we were able to have with some of our committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| that I'll detail here in a moment as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1924)|
| 0:32:06| Some of the things that were really most important as a part of that were economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1926)|
| 0:32:14| We want to be able to have predictable land use and transportation decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| That's something that's going to be an asset for you all, for our planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| for developers in the area, and also for residents to understand the landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| in which they may be looking to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| Also resilience. Resilience by thinking about lessening our impact on natural places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1954)|
| 0:32:41| through coordinated development decisions, having more of that intentional approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| Another thing that was a priority early on was thinking about workforce advancement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1967)|
| 0:32:53| specifically looking at increased choice and connectivity to link our jobs and link our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1973)|
| 0:33:01| Affordability was a major priority as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| Understanding the improved choices about how we live and how we move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| can help make affordability something that's actually within reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| for a greater segment of our population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And finally, prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Understanding that intentional planning is something that actually helps to promote shared prosperity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| So you can see that really all of these different elements, which cover a very wide range of topics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| help to influence what we were approaching as a unified strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| So I mentioned the timeline for this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| This has been going on for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| We started back near the end of 2021, and in early 2022 began to look at our state of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:53| That was a place where we did a pretty deep dive into some existing conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| to better understand what the conditions are out there right now within the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| and also to look at some of our future trends, which things we think may impact the county in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:10| that we needed to be prepared for as we undertook this planning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:14| That translated into our scenario planning exercise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2054)|
| 0:34:17| which took us through the end of 2022, thinking about different alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| and then allowing the public an opportunity to weigh in on what those potential alternatives could look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| and their impact on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| From that, from the information we received, we were able to go into recommendations development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| which took us into 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| And you'll see that through each of those major phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| we did have an opportunity to intentionally engage with the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| and I'll talk about that more in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| And finally, resulting into where we are right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| the preparation of our final plan and consideration for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2093)|
| 0:35:01| So who was involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| We had a large number of groups that we intentionally engaged throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| We were fortunate to have two different standing committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| an advisory committee, which was citizen-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2112)|
| 0:35:16| 27 different members from that committee that we were able to talk with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2116)|
| 0:35:22| In part, those were actually assembled through a publicly advertised application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2122)|
| 0:35:28| We also had a technical committee meeting at the same kind of intervals as our advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2128)|
| 0:35:35| and that technical committee really consisted of some of those subject matter experts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| also folks from City of Knoxville, Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| other regional planning groups and economic development agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| We had two subcommittees that we engaged with periodically through the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| Those subcommittees consisted of utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| so we met with our utility providers throughout the county to learn more about what their needs were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| and their concerns as we thought about growth going forward, and also schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| So meeting periodically with Knox County schools to understand what their needs were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2169)|
| 0:36:13| and how this plan could effectively integrate with those needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Another thing to note is elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2178)|
| 0:36:21| This is obviously a plan focused on the unincorporated county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| but throughout this planning process we met periodically with planning commission, county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| and then also City of Knoxville and Town of Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| because this is a plan that we know just because there are boundaries there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| we need to be very intentional about looking across those boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| and making decisions that are going to be effective for the entirety of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2204)|
| 0:36:50| I mentioned public engagement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| We had three primary rounds of engagement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| and we were incredibly pleased with the feedback that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| We engaged with people in a large number of ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| whether that was in-person workshops, online surveys, virtual workshops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| or also just going out and meeting with standing agencies, committees, and groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| to tell them more about what this plan was, what we were doing, and gather their feedback as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| Our first round was focused on listening and learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| really generating those ideas and hearing about people's issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| And then we went into that scenario planning area that I mentioned in our second round,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| which was focused around making choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| And then finally, getting to our priorities week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| where we were looking at recommendations, getting folks to weigh in on where things had landed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| and looking toward implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| We had the chance throughout those rounds in total to engage with more than 5,000 participants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| which is, I do this all over the country, and we were incredibly excited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| by the level of participation we were able to receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| and very appreciative of the engagement of staff throughout that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2282)|
| 0:38:06| to help activate the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| and make sure that we were hearing from a wide breadth of folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2289)|
| 0:38:14| I did want to touch on the relationship of plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| and then I'm going to turn this over to Michael to talk a little bit about the land use side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| One thing that's helpful to understand is just the comparison of how our plans are working now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| and how we envision them working with the new comprehensive plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| As of right now, we have an overall growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| You all have been talking about that a good bit lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:40| Then that is talking to your general plan as well as a series of six sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2320)|
| 0:38:49| Then all of your sub-plans, whether those be quarter plans, small area plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| those are feeding back into that general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Essentially, all this is doing is removing one extra layer, those sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| so that the comprehensive plan becomes the vehicle for all of that general planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| within a single planning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| It doesn't really change the overall structure of how you have that growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| and your smaller plans feeding in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| It just takes out some of those geographically-based sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| At this point, I'll turn things over to Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| Great. Thanks, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| Again, my name is Michael Curtis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| and I'd like to start talking about some of the things that are in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| beginning with the more general and then starting to work toward the specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| One of the first things I want to point out is that there are a series of eight goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:49| which are on page six of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| We heard a lot of comments earlier about conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| Conservation is actually one of those goals, so that is part of the plan's intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2394)|
| 0:40:02| One of the primary policy pieces in the plan is the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| The future land use map does a lot of things, but it is not a future zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| It is a tool for making potential recommendations about changes to your zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:23| It's also a tool for thinking about where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| and what type of infrastructure improvements may be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| to address some of the growth that we anticipate in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| The future land use map also addresses conservation in terms of focusing a lot of the growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2437)|
| 0:40:45| that you're likely to see over the next 20 years into areas that already have development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| and seeing those places redevelop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| actually developing a bit more intensely than they are today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| as a way to conserve some of the rural areas that people really treasure in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2458)|
| 0:41:08| The way the future land use plan does that is it identifies a series of place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2468)|
| 0:41:15| The place types are calibrated so that they think about different characteristics of uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| and how they look, how they function, depending on their context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Not all uses really are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| and something in a more urban or suburban location is going to have very different types of buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| very different types of transportation needs than something in a more rural area, as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| That's what the plan attempts to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| You see a bunch of colors on the future land use map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| All those colors are tied to place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| which are really just a fancy way of saying they're future land use concepts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2519)|
| 0:42:05| that integrate not just land use but also a mix of perhaps housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| It describes form attributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| so what type of buildings you should expect to see in that type of place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:19| how those buildings relate to one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| It also talks about transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| Is it primarily auto, car-oriented area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| or is it a place where we want to be able to encourage walking and biking first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| and then also accommodate those other modes second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| It's organized around a dozen or so place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| but they're grouped into walkable, compact growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| the suburban growth, and rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| In this example, these are all commercial types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| but as you see, they're very different depending on that context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2576)|
| 0:43:03| This place-based approach goes by a lot of names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| but it's really quite common in terms of comprehensive planning in this period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:15| There are a lot of plans in here, just a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| that I'm familiar with in this region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| that use a very similar type of place-based approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:29| I will also say that I mentioned before the plan is not zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| so the land use plan is a piece of this comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:38| It is the first piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| There's also transportation recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| and parks and open space recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| which we'll hear about in a moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| but that is all part of the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| and that gets adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| before you would consider potential zoning code changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| Now, most communities that we work, when they adopt a comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| it is the assumption that there are going to need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2642)|
| 0:44:05| some changes to your zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:07| in order to implement some of the ideas in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| In some cases, based on the age of the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| and based on the number of recommendations in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| and how they relate to the zoning you already have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| you may need to rewrite the code entirely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| and that's a separate step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| which we expect will take place or start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| shortly after this comprehensive plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| But there are three steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| You would update the zoning code after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| but then the actual zoning map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| would be updated following the zoning code process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| and the zoning map is a legal tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| It talks about what zoning districts are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| and appropriate for development as they are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:59| The future land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| is a tool to make recommendations about zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| but it's really thinking about future characteristics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:10| and there may be more than one zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| that could implement a place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| based on certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| So that's a little bit about the land use piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| I'm going to turn it over to Christina| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| to talk about the transportation aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| and a big piece of the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| and the approach that we've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| to trying to integrate these two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Awesome. Thanks so much, Michael.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2741)|
| 0:45:43| Great to be back out with you guys this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| We're really excited to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| and walk you through some of the intentionality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| that your staff and the community were able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| as we thought about pairing this land use strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| that Michael just walked us through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| with the decisions we're making about our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| As you've heard from everyone tonight already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| there was a big focus on making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| that our capital investments and our growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| are better aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| It's been something that's been a point of frustration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| in the community up to this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| and this was our opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| to be much more intentional about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| As we thought about those land use and transportation goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| we were really trying to align those investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| with where we anticipate growth happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| and we wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| that we were encouraging development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| that provided connectivity and redundancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2795)|
| 0:46:38| so we're not funneling all of our traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| onto our primary streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| and that as we're making those new development decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| we're providing folks with the opportunity to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| to bike, to get out and do stuff a little different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| than they're doing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| where they're entirely reliant on their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| and then that as we're doing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| we have these town center developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| that really allow for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| to have some of those essential services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| in your part of the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| without always having to drive into the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| or the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2831)|
| 0:47:12| and provide that commercial aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2832)|
| 0:47:15| that's really missing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| And then finally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2837)|
| 0:47:18| as you've heard from everyone out here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| the preservation of rural places was really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2841)|
| 0:47:24| and the intentionality with which that was incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| into the place types of the land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| and also respected as we were thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| how we plan for our transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| So you'll see in your plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2857)|
| 0:47:39| that we've had out there for a little bit now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2859)|
| 0:47:42| that there is a transportation recommendations map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Through this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| we actually did a deep dive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| of the county's historic transportation funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| through your capital improvement plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| and with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| we were able to program projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| with what we can reasonably expect to be available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| So this isn't a wish list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| This is projects that, based on historic funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| your tax generation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| partnerships with TDOT and the TPO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| are projects that we can actually tackle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| with the revenue that's out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| And with each of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| so back to that intentionality with land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| we waited to put the transportation recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| after we decided the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2903)|
| 0:48:25| so that we could see this area's recommended to be more intense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| what transportation needs there to serve that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| So that step process, we fed it into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| and it was directly responsive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2917)|
| 0:48:39| to the future direction of land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| I'm going to hit quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| on the four types of projects you'll see in your plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| Safety, kind of self-explanatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| These are the places where we had a high crash history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| and that would need to be modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| to enhance that safety for our drivers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| and folks walking and biking in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Capacity are places where we're actually adding lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| to accommodate more single-occupancy vehicle travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| And then modernization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| something a little unique to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| If you guys have driven around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| you know we have a lot of really narrow roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| that often don't even have striping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| they don't have shoulders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2958)|
| 0:49:19| This is the category that catches some of those roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| that need to be brought up to everyday standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| but don't necessarily need to be widened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| and you'll see a lot of those in some of our rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| And then finally, the multimodal lines you see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2972)|
| 0:49:35| those are our countywide greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:37| that stem from the adopted greenways plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Speaking of greenways, our other category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| that we tackled in the comp plan was parks and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| We actually have a really good baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| to start with for the comp plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| Thinking back to what Allison shared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2990)|
| 0:49:52| about how our plans feed into the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| you all have the 2009 parks plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| and the 2020 Greenway Corridor Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| Those will continue to be used as a guide for decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| and have been very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:06| Those will continue to be used as a guide for decision-making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| and have been folded into the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3009)|
| 0:50:13| But as a part of this, we also looked at a park desert analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| because that was something we heard from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:20| kind of repetitively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| And with that, we looked at the access to parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| within our planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| that were accessible within one mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| And I think an important clarification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3030)|
| 0:50:32| we did include city parks in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| because folks don't decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| I live in the county, I'm only going to a county park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| And what we were able to come up with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| is actually the priority areas for park investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| So as you're looking at these map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| the areas that are darker purple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| are the areas that in the next 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| as the county continues to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| you should really be funneling your search| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| for new land for park facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| And that will help address some of the park deserts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| that were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| So this is a lot to achieve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| and I think one of the things that you've heard over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| is that we wanted to do this in a way that was fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| With the advanced NOx process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| we did do a robust fiscal impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| We looked at historic revenue generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| to understand what may be available in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| We looked at the cost to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3095)|
| 0:51:37| what it costs the county to provide stormwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3097)|
| 0:51:40| what it costs you guys to maintain your roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| provide law enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| any of those general government functions you'll have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| whether that's helping pay for public health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| recreation, all of those things residents want and love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| but it does cost dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3114)|
| 0:51:57| And then if you take that revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| that you're generating from your taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| remove that cost to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| that is your net fiscal impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3123)|
| 0:52:05| no different than balancing your household budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| And what we were able to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| is that if we continue exactly what we're doing today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| without changing any of our decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:18| not changing how we develop our land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| the county would run at a nearly $2 million annual deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| So that's not $2 million between now and 2045,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3145)|
| 0:52:28| that's annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3148)|
| 0:52:30| And that's if we just continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| the suburban single-family sprawl that we have going on today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| that's adding all those new roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| without as high of a return on the tax investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| But back to the scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| that you guys have seen over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| with the preferred scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| if we make those changes to how we develop and grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| we make much smarter decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| and we get closer to a $5 million annual surplus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| that then the county can be intentional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| about improving transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| or being responsive to stormwater needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| or investing in new things like parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:09| and recreation opportunities that folks would like to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3189)|
| 0:53:16| So with that, I'm going to turn it actually back over to Michael| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| and he's going to talk us a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| about how we implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| So adopting the plan is a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| but it's just a start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| and it is envisioned to be a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| It's not something that just gets adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| and then you don't think about it for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| We've actually put together a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| for thinking about how to use the plan on an ongoing basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| So these are a few ways that we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| that the plan be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| You know, when the county is putting together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3239)|
| 0:54:02| annual departmental work programs and budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3242)|
| 0:54:06| they should be referencing things in the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| and how those funding requests are supported by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Of course, I mentioned earlier about development approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3257)|
| 0:54:18| That's obviously a piece of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| and Christina talked about capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| You'll use the plan regularly for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| You may also look to the plan in terms of approving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| economic incentives that you might offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| and then, you know, the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| should also be aware of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| in terms of their decisions about where to make investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| We have also put together a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| for how the plan should be used over an annual cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| and even over a 10-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| So on page 71 of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| there's a page about updating and tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| and so we recommend that on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| there be an assessment of the plan's actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3302)|
| 0:55:05| about development that's taken place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3305)|
| 0:55:07| and that staff put together a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3307)|
| 0:55:10| that is publicly available on what that progress has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| On five-year intervals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| it seems appropriate to think about potential updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:25| that may need to take place to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| Now, there may come opportunities for making updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| you know, before a five-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| but we think, in general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| a plan should be re-evaluated and perhaps updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| in a small way in a five-year period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and then at 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| we definitely think that probably enough has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| that you really need to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| a wholesale update to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:59| So I mentioned earlier about zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| There is an appendix to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| which correlates the place types| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| that are on the future land use map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| to your current zoning categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:12| Now, this is something that most comprehensive plans will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| relating their land use categories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| to their zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| as a way to help with the decision-making process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3383)|
| 0:56:26| and it's never a one-for-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:28| There's usually, you know, two, three, four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| potential zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| that under certain context, certain situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| could be just appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| for implementing a certain place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| So that's what this matrix tries to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| and we decided not to put this zoning correspondence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| within each place type's definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| simply because we realized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| you would be updating your zoning code very soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3414)|
| 0:56:57| and that information would be outdated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| So we put it all in this appendix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3420)|
| 0:57:02| with this matrix that talks about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| your current zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3425)|
| 0:57:07| and how they relate to those place types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| which ones are appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| which ones are potentially appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| given some criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| and which ones are probably not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| And again, this is something that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| is an interim tool until you update your zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| But it's probably something also that gets updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| once that code is finished and adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3449)|
| 0:57:34| So Allison's going to wrap us up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| with a summary of some of the plan revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3456)|
| 0:57:39| that have happened recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:47| So I am the last presenter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3467)|
| 0:57:49| from this cavalcade of consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3469)|
| 0:57:52| and I did want to step us through our plan revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3472)|
| 0:57:57| We've had a draft of our comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3477)|
| 0:58:00| up online since October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| and since that time we've had the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| to present to this group, to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| to the city and the town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| and to learn more from you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| and from members of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| based on feedback that we have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| and respond to some of those suggested revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:23| to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| I will note that for those of you all on the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| you have a handout today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| that does include all of those items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| that have been revised from the October draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3515)|
| 0:58:38| I am not going to cover these in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| I'm just going to provide a quick overarching summary of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| But I will also note that all of these proposed revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| are included online on our project website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| at www.advancenox.org.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:55| So I think that this has been a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| to be very transparent with what those recommendations may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| including those revisions as they have been suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| and advanced over the past several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| So I will just briefly move us through some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| and I will conclude with those that were suggested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| most recently by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| And again, in case things start going wonky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| you all have this in a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| So for our plan revisions, a series of updates were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| They covered a few of our different chapters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| as well as our appendices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:39| Just to point out a couple of these highlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| I will note that in our Chapter 2, our framework chapter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:47| there was a new place type that was added in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3587)|
| 0:59:50| to some of the feedback we have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| It's a rural agriculture place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| So please take note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Also, we had identified some areas for future study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| and the Chodo community was added as one of those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3602)|
| 1:00:06| that has been highlighted for future study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| The intent of those future studies will be just to learn more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| and come up with more specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| for those specific areas that may not currently be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:20| just based on previous planning efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| that have already been conducted and an acknowledgement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| of how those areas may be expected to grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| or change in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| In Chapter 3, primarily the revisions that were identified here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:35| focused around our actions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| There were some updates made to some of the actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3637)|
| 1:00:40| and you can see the particular actions that were highlighted there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| Also, in Chapter 3, you can see that we updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3645)|
| 1:00:50| the how to use the plans section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3650)|
| 1:00:53| So this is some of what you just heard Michael speaking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3653)|
| 1:00:57| as far as that implementation component, how we see this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| kind of relating to some of the other efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3661)|
| 1:01:03| that you all will be undertaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| or that other planning efforts that exist within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| Also, updating the criteria for a plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| which I think is helpful information to have revised there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| We mentioned Appendix H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3680)|
| 1:01:24| You heard Michael just talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| That place type and zoning correspondence matrix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:29| was also updated based on feedback that we have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:33| through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| I wanted to take a moment to point out that through this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| we have also identified plan amendment criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| This is essentially the process for plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3704)|
| 1:01:48| that would be undertaken following the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| So just pointing out that there's certainly, this is an active,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| this is a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| We do anticipate that over the life of this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:04| there likely will be need for plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| But we've tried to be mindful about what those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| could take the form of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| and what might precipitate the need for an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| So those criteria that you see on the screen there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| include changes in conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| introduction of new utilities or state or federal projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| new data regarding trends, projections, or traffic growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| and also noting that the changes that are being proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| support the policies, goals, objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| and criteria of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:43| So that's just something that as you all continue to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| with this plan going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| we have put in place to help consider when those amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| may be practical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3771)|
| 1:02:55| So most recently on March 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| this plan was presented to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| The Planning Commission did make a series of recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| Those are also included in this handout here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| and also posted online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Just to highlight a couple of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| that came from Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| The criteria for a plan update was also recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3793)|
| 1:03:18| to be updated slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| That included things like adding a local roads description| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| and adding housing conditions to a list of new data types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| adding an additional action item to Policy 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| that focuses on the research and proposing of incentives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| and development standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3818)|
| 1:03:42| also updating place type definitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| specifically looking at adding bike and walk as secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3826)|
| 1:03:50| for suburban, residential, mixed residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| and corridor commercial place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| And then again, we mentioned Appendix 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| adding rural preservation to the rural conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| as a partially related zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:08| So that was just a quick overview of those revisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| I just wanted to briefly touch on our next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| As you all know, the Planning Commission did recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3857)|
| 1:04:20| this comprehensive plan for approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| during their March 7th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| We are having today's public hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:28| and then the County Commission voting session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| is set for April 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| So I wanted to just say thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| I am a Knox County native.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| Although I don't live in Knoxville anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| it's been a real pleasure to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| and help to make a positive impact in the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3886)|
| 1:04:49| that I called home for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3889)|
| 1:04:52| So thank you all, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| And we'll be happy to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| Commissioners, if you'd just indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| your interest in speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Thank you for the great presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| I've heard that a couple of times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| just trying to be as active and engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| in this process over the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| both as a citizen and now an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3923)|
| 1:05:28| So thank you all for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| I really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| This is something that I've advocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| for over the course of probably 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| just knowing the impact of growth and development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| on our communities, especially our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3941)|
| 1:05:44| And speaking from experience, my sons as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| So I'm appreciative of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I just have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| If we want to make additional suggested changes or revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| or even create possibly a new section or criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3958)|
| 1:06:02| like a couple of examples with hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| and ridgetop protection or updating the soil map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| as part of the process, because our soil map is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| I believe, about 10 years old or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| or just tweaking some of the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| what does that process look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| I'm just asking, what does that process look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| If we have suggested changes or revisions or additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| what are the steps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| How is that considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3991)|
| 1:06:33| And if this body were to approve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3993)|
| 1:06:35| does it then go back to planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3995)|
| 1:06:37| Or what is the best way to push those forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:42| So I would defer to Director Moyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| It depends on what you all suggest for additional amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| to the plan and whether or not it needs to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:54| to planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| But it is within your purview to make changes to it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| So what would be the best process for doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| Is that something where I provide all of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4022)|
| 1:07:05| with my suggested revisions or changes or additions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| and then it's brought to planning commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| And I'm just looking for the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| and what's the best way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| Well, the way it works is basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| wow, that's loud, the way it's always worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| Try to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4045)|
| 1:07:29| The law requires that you have the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| of the planning commission before you adopt a zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| a rezoning, a planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4056)|
| 1:07:39| a zoning, a rezoning as a plan or anything else like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| So when you talk about amendments to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| whether it would need to go back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| would have to do with whether they'd considered it prior,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| if they'd considered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| And for example, let's say that they considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| the hilltop protection plan and recommended it be voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4077)|
| 1:07:59| and you want to make it mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| Since they've already considered it, if you make it mandatory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| it does not need to go back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| because they've looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| But if it's something that hasn't been considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| if it's brand new, then that's the kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4089)|
| 1:08:11| that generally has to go back to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4091)|
| 1:08:13| for their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| The case law is pretty clear that all that's required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4094)|
| 1:08:17| is their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4097)|
| 1:08:18| You're not required to follow it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| but you are required to get their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| So with regard to each change you wish to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4101)|
| 1:08:25| I would ask myself, has the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4105)|
| 1:08:28| considered this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| If so, then the commission can go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| and do whatever it wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| Had they not considered it, then that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| that probably would need to go back for their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| And is that our responsibility to filter out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| those suggestions or changes if it was discussed or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4122)|
| 1:08:46| or is that something that the law department would do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| Well, normally it happens that somebody will point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4128)|
| 1:08:53| you know, this has not been considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4133)|
| 1:08:55| by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| We've got a lot of people involved in this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4136)|
| 1:08:59| and if you bring up something, I'm certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4139)|
| 1:09:01| as closely as you followed it, if there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4141)|
| 1:09:04| that has not been considered by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| I'm sure that you'll probably be pretty well aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| At the end of the day, there's no bright line distinction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4149)|
| 1:09:12| It's a bit frustrating sometimes because there is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4152)|
| 1:09:15| you know, absolutely objective line that I can draw for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4155)|
| 1:09:20| about whether something has to go back or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| It's just required that if it's novel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4162)|
| 1:09:27| if it hasn't been considered by the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4167)|
| 1:09:29| then it needs to go back most of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| It also, also some of the case law suggests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| that if the change is one that would not be likely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| to have the planning commission make a different recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| then that's something as well that doesn't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| have to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4186)|
| 1:09:47| But it's a very vague and fuzzy line, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| So take an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| If I wanted the soil map to be updated as part of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:58| is that something that would be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| into a condition of a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| You could, well, so what you're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| you would adopt the comprehensive plan contingent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4208)|
| 1:10:11| upon the soil plan being updated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| I'm asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| Well, I mean, that is a thing you could do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| but then the problem with that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| depending on how long the soil plan requires to be updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| it could take a month, two months, five months, six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| ten months, a year before the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| actually goes into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Well, I think there's language we could use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| where we could put it into process as a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| that it would refer to the updated soil map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| I think there's a way to massage that language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| so that it wouldn't hold up the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| The word contingent is a difficult word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4246)|
| 1:10:47| because it would hold it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4247)|
| 1:10:49| But you could state that you're approving this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| and directing the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| or whoever is in charge of updating the soil map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| to do that and reference the updated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| whatever the most updated soil map is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4262)|
| 1:11:03| That gives me a little bit of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4263)|
| 1:11:06| What's the process for future revisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:09| if it comes before that kind of targeted five-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4269)|
| 1:11:19| Well, do you want to handle that or do you want me to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4279)|
| 1:11:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| Again, unless there's a different process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| that's been placed into this plan that I haven't seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4287)|
| 1:11:30| it would be the same as we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| A proposed amendment would go to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| A recommendation would be made to come to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| which would then vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4297)|
| 1:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Quick question about how are the locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| for the rural ag place type determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| Can you all give us a little bit of info on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| So how we determined that was we looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:58| all the century farms were identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| We have maintained a list of those for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| We also looked at the requests that came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| when you all were going through the road policy plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| so the opt-out requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4331)|
| 1:12:12| so any of those that were greater than 15 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| and currently located in a rural living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| or rural conservation place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| And so in total that equaled about 3,800 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| that were added to the map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4344)|
| 1:12:25| Okay, that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| Have we considered using the USDA county office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| like their list of registered farms as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:32| just as a cross-reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4352)|
| 1:12:33| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:34| I'm not familiar with that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Would we be able to consider that if it's provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| or just as a cross-reference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I just don't want to miss anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4362)|
| 1:12:43| We could take a look at it in cross-reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:47| Also, we had talked about, I know briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4367)|
| 1:12:49| about layering the KGIS map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| with environmentally sensitive areas of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4372)|
| 1:12:55| like steep slopes, prime ag, national registers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| floodplains, wetlands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| And I suggest that only because I'm kind of curious to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:07| are we proposing any potential subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| or commercial developments over those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| that maybe we weren't identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| and being intentional with those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I'll see if the consultant team wants to add anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| So if you look on page nine of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:24| there was a suitability analysis that was conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| and so there were a number of different factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4407)|
| 1:13:29| that were included in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:32| which included constraints such as wetlands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| floodplains, hillside, ridgetop protection areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:38| and then obviously existing growth policy boundaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| in parks and schools and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| Would it be possible, though, that we could include those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| on a layer of the map to identify them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| We have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I'm not sure if we have all of those layers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4433)|
| 1:13:54| but a lot of the layers that you mentioned, KGIS already has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| They're already available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| We can talk more about that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:04| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| So let's look at Appendix H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| because I understand that that's supposed to be our guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| during the transition period until we have the new UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4449)|
| 1:14:14| Is that going to be a guide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| or is that a requirement to follow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| And the reason I ask is because both Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| and Counting Commission, we've been advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| that we may consider a wide variety of zoning districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| for requests under a given place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:27| And so, like, for an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| if there's a request to rezone a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| under the rural conservation place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| the applicant is requesting the RA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| In the Appendix H, it lists the RA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| as not related or appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| for the rural conservation place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| So is it allowable for the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| to recommend RA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| or would that be inconsistent with the comprehensive plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4489)|
| 1:14:56| Let me start by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4496)|
| 1:14:57| the staff is going to use this Appendix H| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| to inform all of our recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| that go to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| So we will use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| It's not just a guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:06| It is what we will use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| Once it goes to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| they obviously can make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| that is different than Planning staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| They just need to have a rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| of why it still complies with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:19| And then they send it on to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| and you all have the final say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4521)|
| 1:15:31| Would you ask that question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| It's really considering a wide variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| of zoning districts under given place types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| So if an applicant is requesting a zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| that is not, if you look at Appendix H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4548)|
| 1:15:51| if it's not listed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| what are the considerations of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| You mean it doesn't fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| into the future plan land use designations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4558)|
| 1:16:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| And if I can clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| it's similar to what we do now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| with our land use classifications table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| Our staff looks at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| There are specific zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| that are listed in those land use types,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| and we use that as a guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| to help inform our decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:17| that are made to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4577)|
| 1:16:18| or recommendations that are made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:19| to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| And you all, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| it's not different than what we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| Well, I think that's where my biggest concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| I really need that criteria to be strengthened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| We've become too predictable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| and it's, I don't want us to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| into the same bad habit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4596)|
| 1:16:39| of just rubber stamping things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| And I saw where Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| made the recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| to reduce the number of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4607)|
| 1:16:50| that has to be met from two to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| And so we're already seeing a push| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| to get back into that comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| yet predictable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:01| it says that, but we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| So I will be bringing some suggestions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| to strengthen that criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| because I'm just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| I'm still not comfortable with where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| So, also we continue to see Ag and Farm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| land as a loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| We've talked a lot about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| Again, that was one of the priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| that came out of all the public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| And I'm still struggling to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4646)|
| 1:17:30| where's the teeth in the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| That's the one thing that I hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| from constituents consistently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| is that we had recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| we had things that were advisory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| we had conservation subdivision standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| and we didn't do anything with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| So what's going to be enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| and codified at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| that will protect our rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| and preserve some of our best prime farm soil?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:11| As both Michael, as Michael said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:14| and as we talked about previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| that's the next step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| So you need to update your regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Our zoning code is very old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| We want to update the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| There's a number of tools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4705)|
| 1:18:27| that need to be updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| in order to implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| We did make some changes to the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| to add some shalls and must,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| so it really does provide clear direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| when we get to that next stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| But again, that's to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| That's where the hard work is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4721)|
| 1:18:49| Just to add one more thing to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| I think that regarding the comprehensive plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| I think that one of the biggest things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4735)|
| 1:18:57| that is a change with this comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| is compared to the current planning structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| that we're kind of operating within in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| is that we do have the cohesiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| of the land use recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| and the transportation recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| and the parks recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:12| that hasn't been present in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| So having that, I think, organically facilitates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| some of when we see some of that growth being projected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| we've already looked at, in a fiscally responsible way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| the transportation that may be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| to actually accommodate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| and also have talked to the utility providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| to be sure that that's actually reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| that they can serve that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| So some of that very intentional coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| that hasn't really had the opportunity to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4779)|
| 1:19:43| I guess, in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:44| has been done through the auspices of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| Thanks. That's all of my questions for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4791)|
| 1:19:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Mr. Moyers, can you help me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| I want to just make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| We have a timeline and a deadline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| related to this whole process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| which ends in May?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Maybe Mandy knows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| I believe it's May 27th, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| Mandy? We figured, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4813)|
| 1:20:15| Okay. So it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| The timeline is for the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| not the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| But we've tied them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| So we don't have one or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| We've got them both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| And I think that's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| because if we don't stick with this timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4831)|
| 1:20:35| having married them both and decided to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| we go right back to the beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| and we stay with status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| and it is not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| The timeline, the process, the amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| time and energy has been spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| And I say that just to move along the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:56| that as we get through this vote in Farragut next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4856)|
| 1:21:02| and then we come back to our vote in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| if there are amendments, as you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| to the final vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| that have not been considered by Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| I don't think we have time to go back to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| come back to us and still get it done in the timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| or the timeline is very, very short to pull that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| That is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4884)|
| 1:21:25| It can be overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| There's ways to address it, but it is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| Right now, the resolution that was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| by the County Commission does tie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| the passage of the growth plan to the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| If it were felt by the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4902)|
| 1:21:44| that there were changes that needed to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| to the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| that were sufficiently novel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4910)|
| 1:21:54| that it would require resubmission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| the Commission could amend its earlier resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| and unhook the growth plan from the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| That is an option you would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| But if our intent is to stay together...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| If the intent is to stay together, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| We have to have everything done by May 27th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:18| Thank you very much, Mr. Morris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| I just remind my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| in addition to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| that is right on top of budget season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| which is a massive amount of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| that we're doing right on top of everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| I want to make sure we're really...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| I have an idea that threads to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4952)|
| 1:22:35| This is just a suggestion for you, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:39| and for our colleagues to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| As we get to this vote in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4962)|
| 1:22:45| my recommendation would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| if there are any revisions to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| that colleagues want to present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| that they very specifically say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| I am recommending that we, as part of the final vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4977)|
| 1:23:01| change it from ABC to DEF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:05| very specifically on our forum, where everybody can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| And then in the voting process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| we take each of those amendments one by one and vote on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| They go up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4993)|
| 1:23:15| And then once we're done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| it's kind of like our nomination process or budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| Let's say there's 10 amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| and we've in advance determined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| all 10 amendments have been considered by Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5003)|
| 1:23:26| so we don't have to go back and forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| that we take those one by one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| maybe six pass and four don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| And then we go, okay, we've got all of our amendments voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| and we include those in the final adoption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5014)|
| 1:23:37| so that we do it all in one kind of parliamentary way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5017)|
| 1:23:40| And I may say, I want an amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5020)|
| 1:23:43| and it gets voted up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| and then we just go through and process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| And then I think that way we can, if adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5027)|
| 1:23:49| we can then move the whole thing to one vote and adoption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5029)|
| 1:23:52| keep our dual paths married, keep our timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| And as you've said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| we can always come back and do additional changes later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| So even in June, somebody can say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| oh, I didn't get my, I have a different kind of amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| They could still do a single vote and a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5046)|
| 1:24:10| So this is going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| we hope it's not going to be a living document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| where we change every month or two months or three months or five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| but there is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| So if we didn't get it all done in one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| let's not let the perfect be the enemy of good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| and stop the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5062)|
| 1:24:25| and really cause ourselves a backlog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| So just a thought and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I do have one question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| I just want to make sure I'm clear on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| I do understand Commissioner Frazier's concern of like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| where are the teeth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5081)|
| 1:24:43| Like, where do we get to the actual law, the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| the thing that's going to tie everybody together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| And you said that is in the unified, the UDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5089)|
| 1:24:52| and updating the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| and all of those tools that keep us in this path, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| You can't have a new zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5102)|
| 1:25:07| and ordinance, unified ordinance, without a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| Because the plan dictates kind of where we're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| So this has to come before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| We all know it's part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| But that starts almost immediately, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| So if this gets adopted before May, we go into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| okay, let's start updating the zoning code immediately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| and we know it might take 12 or 18 months, but we're on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| We'll be working with the consultant team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| to help us do that, but yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Okay, and that's the teeth that says you can do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| you can't do this, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5136)|
| 1:25:37| And if Michael, if you want to talk about how other communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| if you all are interested in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| how they use their plans to help inform their ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5142)|
| 1:25:46| we can have that discussion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5146)|
| 1:25:47| Yeah, I would love to hear about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5147)|
| 1:25:48| but I also would like to hear about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| we've adopted the new plan that says we're going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| this is our vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5154)|
| 1:25:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5155)|
| 1:25:56| And with this comprehensive glow through transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| the whole bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| While we're updating the actual zoning teeth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| do we operate under the old zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5163)|
| 1:26:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5165)|
| 1:26:06| Okay, so until that process is complete, we're still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5166)|
| 1:26:09| we have a new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5169)|
| 1:26:10| but we're kind of working on the old plan's teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Absolutely, and that's why we have this appendix H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| Okay, just wanted to make sure I was clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5176)|
| 1:26:17| but I would love to hear about how other people have made that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| transition, because it is a timely process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| and I appreciate the feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| So I would add that there may be some things that are discussed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5187)|
| 1:26:32| the plan that just are really difficult to implement without the teeth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5192)|
| 1:26:37| in place of zoning changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5197)|
| 1:26:39| And you may not be able to do it quite the way you want to with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| current zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| We've seen some communities that they don't want to wait for the 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5204)|
| 1:26:48| month, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| full zoning code rewrite to get these things in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| sometimes they'll take on like interim code amendments just to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| certain things available in their toolkit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5218)|
| 1:27:01| to implement certain big ideas that are really important before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| entire code is, you know, is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| So that's one way of dealing with these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5230)|
| 1:27:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5231)|
| 1:27:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5232)|
| 1:27:13| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5233)|
| 1:27:14| One last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5234)|
| 1:27:15| And I'm going to just reiterate one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5235)|
| 1:27:16| I really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5236)|
| 1:27:17| if there are amendments and we go through a process like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| I really would highly recommend that we all agree that those are posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:24| individually in advance so we can digest them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5244)|
| 1:27:27| not at the actual voting meeting where we don't have a chance to really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| really dig into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| And I support that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| It's going to put all of us in a real precarious position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5256)|
| 1:27:40| If something appears from one of us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| three hours before we sit down for this vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5263)|
| 1:27:45| So please, I think that's an excellent idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| Commissioner Skinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Can you pull up the draft comprehensive land use plan on the TVs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5271)|
| 1:28:11| The 82 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5298)|
| 1:28:48| Page 72, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5328)|
| 1:29:18| Page 72, document page, PDF page 76.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5358)|
| 1:29:49| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| Blue box criteria for a plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| The first one says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5395)|
| 1:29:56| the first bullet point says changes of conditions such as surrounding land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| Seems somewhat ambiguous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5403)|
| 1:30:06| but does that mean that if a apartment complex was approved by Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| planning a mile away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| then that would make it significant enough to change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5412)|
| 1:30:19| Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5419)|
| 1:30:25| I don't know that staff would consider that a significant enough change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:28| but I can't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5428)|
| 1:30:29| I cannot speak for the planning commissioner in this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| And stay right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| Can you see number three down there where it says new data regarding trends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5434)|
| 1:30:38| or projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5440)|
| 1:30:41| Who is the authority for new data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| Authority for new data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| ultimately you all are the authority to change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| That would be ultimately within your purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| whether or not you thought the data was a justification enough to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5451)|
| 1:30:53| to change the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Who establishes the data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| It can come from a number of different sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| It just depends on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5459)|
| 1:31:00| like if it's projections that could come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5460)|
| 1:31:03| from the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| it could come from CBER,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| which we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5467)|
| 1:31:09| It really just depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| And then on the opening paragraph of the blue box,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| it says that if two or more criteria apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| it may be appropriate to update the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| Who changed the language before it was submitted to NOC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| to the NOC's planning commissioners to change that from two to one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| The,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| the planning commissioners changed it from two to one during their meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:34| And how was that brought to their attention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5494)|
| 1:31:38| That was part of their review of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| In terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| I mean they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| they reviewed the plan just like you all are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| So could the public perceive this as that makes it now easier for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| development community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| I guess that that's subject to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5515)|
| 1:31:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5518)|
| 1:31:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5519)|
| 1:32:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Can you scroll to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5521)|

| 1:32:15| doesn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5535)|
| 1:32:18| Yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5538)|

| 1:32:30| you see that we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| we've attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5552)|
| 1:32:33| identified basically $324 million worth of road improvements for NOC's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:40| county through 2045.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| Is this the total that NOC's county would have to spend to get our roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5563)|
| 1:32:50| to the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5570)|

| 1:33:00| No,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| It's my understanding folks from Kimberley Horn can correct me because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| were the one that prepared this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| This would be just assuming our traditional spans through those periods of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5592)|
| 1:33:13| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5593)|
| 1:33:14| sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:16| That doesn't really set a level of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5596)|
| 1:33:17| It's more of just saying under our current trends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| this is what we would spend during that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| And then on the next page where you have identified separate projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:25| are those included in the $324 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5605)|
| 1:33:30| It's my understanding that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| So did the consultants then figure out if we wanted to accomplish all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5618)|
| 1:33:39| what it would take is a tax increase to be able,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| through property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:43| to be able to accomplish raising this kind of revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| I think this was predicated on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| I think this is predicated on the existing tax rates we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5634)|
| 1:33:55| sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| But you can repave roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| you can fix sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| gutters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| safety improvement projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| and still complete everything that needs to be done to get Knox County up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| to the level that it needs to be with this growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| with the current funding that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5651)|
| 1:34:14| Based on this analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| If I can add just a couple of details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5660)|
| 1:34:23| the numbers that we see here are specific to county funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| So what we're not talking about here is additional federal or state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| transportation funding that would be coming through the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| That's not something that we studied as a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| That's obviously handled separately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| actually through the ongoing metropolitan transportation planning process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| that's being conducted by the TPO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| So I did just want to note that I will also note that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5685)|
| 1:34:49| as Christina alluded to in her presentation earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| that when we were talking about the specific projects that are shown here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:57| we did go through a project prioritization process to identify those that had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| the greatest need and then focused on moving those more toward the near term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| So the intent here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| while we may never be able to address all of the needs that present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| themselves across the county from a transportation perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| we are addressing those highest priority needs first and looking to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| that, of course, with our land use decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5721)|
| 1:35:24| looking at all of the considerations here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5724)|
| 1:35:27| I will also note, just one final note,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5727)|
| 1:35:29| that for all of the projects that are recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| even those that fall outside of the time years that are included here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| that there have been cost estimates prepared based on what we currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5741)|
| 1:35:42| These are planning level cost estimates to help us understand the magnitude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5742)|
| 1:35:45| of the impact of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5745)|
| 1:35:48| So this would be classified more of the minimum requirements to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5748)|
| 1:35:54| our transportation infrastructure somewhat up to par then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| Yeah, the way I think I would, sorry, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| I think minimum recommendation to get it up to par is a stretch because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| assuming revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| I think if I understand what you're asking, you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| does this list 100% serve every transportation need that the county will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| between now and 2045?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5781)|
| 1:36:23| And the answer is likely no because they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| even with all of the state funds and all of the federal funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5786)|
| 1:36:29| there's not enough money to fix all 500 and some miles of road in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| So this is using our current tax rate to get at the best we can achieve and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5795)|
| 1:36:43| then aligning that with where the growth is happening so that it's done more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| intentionally and timely for that growth to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| But it will not be a panacea or a solution for every little problem that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| out there with our transportation system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5817)|
| 1:36:58| And we do have 2,000 miles of county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| And then just from your perspective, my last question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| you guys developed the timeline when all the process was going to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5830)|
| 1:37:15| and then we were to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| Were you surprised that on the basic timeline that we had at the end now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| that we were required by Tennessee code annotated to have a 30-day period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| before we voted to have a public meeting so the public could come out and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| could hear their concerns before we voted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Were you surprised at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| I think that every time we go through an adoption process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| we're always deferring to the state or local codes that are subject to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5870)|
| 1:37:51| So that's just a place where we always try to work with staff or legal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| understand exactly what those are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:57| And as these processes don't come along that often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| sometimes there has to be a little bit of digging to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| following everything to the letter as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Mr. Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5890)|
| 1:38:15| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:16| I want to piggyback on Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| I have some concerns about not having any teeth to be enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| these policies to protect our rural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| farmland and the hillside and ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| So my question, I guess, would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5911)|
| 1:38:33| when you talk about having a five or ten-year assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| does that mean they would be able to go back and change these land use so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| they could come back and take some of the farmland away in a five or ten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| year assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| Is that, that would be my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5930)|
| 1:38:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| So, I mean, there could be an assessment at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| It could actually happen sooner, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5940)|
| 1:39:04| if the Planning Commission and you all think that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5944)|
| 1:39:10| But, you know, I think there should be a process for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| what those changes are that are being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| So it shouldn't be arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5959)|
| 1:39:20| But, I mean, there's no way to protect what is established now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| You're saying it could always be revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5966)|
| 1:39:28| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| Well, there, you know, for any plan revision process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| there needs to be a public process behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| But, again, the plan is that recommending document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5978)|
| 1:39:42| The zoning, the zoning map, the zoning code that is adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| that is the law that says what can and can't be developed in a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:53| area right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| So it's always subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| If it's voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6003)|
| 1:40:04| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6006)|

| 1:40:18| the verbiage that I hear everyone using is they, they.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| You know, it's us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| We are the ultimate decision-making authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| And we can, everything in here when it comes to our vote is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| as we've heard our law department say all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6036)|
| 1:40:39| you can vote for whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:43| So in the end, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6043)|
| 1:40:46| this is only as good as the commissioners sitting up here decide to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6046)|
| 1:40:52| it in standing behind what the new comprehensive plan and the new zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6052)|
| 1:40:59| ordinances are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| It's still in the end will fall to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| And certainly everything's subject to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6063)|
| 1:41:10| It's still us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| It's still whoever is, yeah, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6072)|
| 1:41:16| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| Does anyone else have any, I just have a couple of comments here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6079)|
| 1:41:25| just to be sure I didn't overlook something I saw in the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| where a conservation place type was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6089)|
| 1:41:34| Did I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6094)|
| 1:41:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| But it is not in this February 24 document lap from last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6097)|
| 1:41:42| Is it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| We've had, we've had the rural conservation place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| We added a rural agriculture place type and it should be correct in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6107)|
| 1:41:53| in your document from February rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6116)|
| 1:41:57| So it's not rural ag and rural conservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6120)|
| 1:42:01| They're separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6121)|

| 1:42:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6125)|
| 1:42:06| I see it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6126)|
| 1:42:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:08| Cause I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6128)|
| 1:42:09| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6129)|
| 1:42:10| I did hear a speaker say that there was no place that it was addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6130)|
| 1:42:13| And I just wanted to point out that it is in fact in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6133)|
| 1:42:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| I do hear what you say about the, you know, reasons for changing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| You know, just in essence needing one reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6152)|
| 1:42:37| But in the end that still spins back to it's going to be what we, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| we make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| So I'm excited about this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| I, I plans always need tweaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| There's always probably always room for a little bit of change, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| over it all overall, I appreciate what y'all put into this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| I know, well, this is what you all do for a living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| It's all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| But I know the added burden that's been on our staff has just been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:11| incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| One more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:20| I'm looking again at the maintenance priorities and Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| Stone, you were being asked about, you know, how this, or all, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6203)|
| 1:43:28| you were being asked about how this budget's out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| This actually, and this is this maintenance priorities and it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| not include DOT money or federal funding, roughly over the 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:41| just divides out to about 16 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| How does that square with, with, with what your budget looks like now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6224)|
| 1:43:51| And just so I make sure I understand that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| So you're saying, repeat the question one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| On this page 45, when they were talking about maintenance priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:02| and, and they did clarify it does not include state and federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6242)|
| 1:44:06| monies, which I know sometimes it's very significant to us, but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| what's listed here, roughly over this 20 year period, I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| stating divides out to about 16 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| Divides out to about 16 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| And I just wonder how that's squared with currently what, what your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6261)|
| 1:44:26| budget looks like in today's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6266)|
| 1:44:30| Although I know even that's not a real number, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| Are you referring to the, the amount we get from the, the, the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| aid fund or you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| No, I'm actually talking about your Knox County budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Oh, just, just the Knox County maintenance budget or capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| No, not capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Just the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Just maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| So typically, yeah, we get on average between six and a half and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| $7 million for, you know, really resurfacing annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| The, the total of the, the, the highway department itself is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| 15, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| So a large portion of that obviously is salaries and benefits of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| large, very large staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6309)|
| 1:45:11| But typically on average we spend about seven or $8 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| for resurfacing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6316)|
| 1:45:17| And state and federal money is also used for a lot of these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6317)|
| 1:45:22| also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| We receive on average of about six to $700,000 additionally above and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| beyond that seven to $8 million for roadway maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| We also are part of the bridge, bridge state aid bridge grant program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| which is really based on the, the structural capacity of the bridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6337)|
| 1:45:42| Cities are actually able to use some of that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| And then the TPO is obviously a little bit more dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| You know, you've, you sit on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6349)|
| 1:45:51| It's, it's a little bit, there's a, you know, 13 or 14 agencies that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6351)|
| 1:45:55| fighting for those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:57| So, you know, it's, it's kind of a little bit unpredictable as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| how much we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| But, but yes, that's generally in, in, in sync of what we typically get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6369)|
| 1:46:10| So this is really probably more question from the consultants then his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| his total dollars that he's talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| even with the few things he threw in probably didn't even hit 10 million a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6378)|
| 1:46:23| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| So I heard, did I hear you say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| that this squares with current revenues that are generated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6387)|
| 1:46:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| So I know that up on screen here, we're showing some specific projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6394)|
| 1:46:38| So we're really looking at the capital funding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6398)|
| 1:46:40| So what we started with is we looked at our historic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| not capital funding, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6406)|
| 1:46:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| I think that what we did to kind of start our process is we looked at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| of the different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| You can push it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6414)|
| 1:47:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6429)|
| 1:47:10| It's working now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6430)|
| 1:47:11| It had to go to sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6431)|
| 1:47:12| Before we got to the capital allocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| we started with looking at some particular program allocations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| things like maintenance, bridging, culvert, signal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6442)|
| 1:47:26| maintenance, spot safety, and also pedestrian improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| Those particular types of programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| We didn't go to the level of calling out the specific projects because those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6452)|
| 1:47:36| are really allocated on an annual or as needed basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| So, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| we tried to draw from essentially what the historic values of each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| were and continued those out just based on guidance from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| But we expect those to be pretty well in line with what we've seen from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6469)|
| 1:47:53| historic budget levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6473)|
| 1:47:55| But it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| I mean, I'm just saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| That doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| We'll try.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6482)|
| 1:48:03| Try another way of explaining it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6483)|
| 1:48:05| Maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6485)|
| 1:48:06| So this, the intent of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| This transportation plane here was to fiscally constrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| So the consultants went through all of the potential projects in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| that have ever been planned for before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| And that was what they called the universe of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| And you'll be able to see that in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| It's in one of the appendices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6507)|
| 1:48:28| And that kind of outlines all of the things we've ever identified as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| needing to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6512)|
| 1:48:34| And you'll notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| You'll notice that there are a lot of those projects in Harvey Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| And the reason is because we've recently finished the Harvey Valley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| resilience project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| So we had a lot of projects to draw from, and they were in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| Then from those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| we looked at what we had historically got in terms of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6531)|
| 1:48:55| And this is in line with what we've historically got in terms of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6535)|
| 1:49:00| And we said, if we only had this many dollars, what would we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| And so we went for a prioritization based on growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| based on other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| And we said we would do these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6549)|
| 1:49:12| And that's what you'll see listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6552)|
| 1:49:14| So you'll see the near-term, mid-term, and long-term projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| and all those maintenance priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| They're all covered by what we expect to get in terms of revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6559)|
| 1:49:23| All of the other projects that are included in the plan are included in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6563)|
| 1:49:27| the universe of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| We're also going to be including some studies in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| Choteau, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| And we'll have some additional projects that we want to put into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6575)|
| 1:49:38| capital budget, but both capital and maintenance are covered by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6578)|
| 1:49:41| existing expected revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6581)|
| 1:49:44| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6588)|
| 1:49:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6589)|
| 1:49:50| I mean, what you're saying makes perfect sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| I'm just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6592)|
| 1:49:54| Mr. Hill, you're asking about the inflation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| because this number is bigger than what Jim just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| Well, as I said, it averages out roughly to about $16 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6600)|
| 1:50:04| And I hear our...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| Current budget is $8 or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| And even with little extras, maybe $10 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6610)|
| 1:50:13| So are you stating over the next 20 years that the inflationary aspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6613)|
| 1:50:19| is going to level all this out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| So there's a couple of things that play into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6622)|
| 1:50:24| As we did our historic review, we actually took a look at what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6624)|
| 1:50:28| historic increase was year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6628)|
| 1:50:31| So there is a small inflation factor applied to what Jim's current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| annual budget is now based on historic trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| And those...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| We went all the way back to what the county's been spending since 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6640)|
| 1:50:44| And we did a year-over-year inflation trend line to see what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6644)|
| 1:50:48| percentage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| And then we knocked it way back to be super conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| So depending on the year and what the economic conditions were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| sometimes the county was running an 8% to 12% year-over-year increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| and other years they were completely flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| So in this plan, I can't remember the exact number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6664)|
| 1:51:06| but we were closer to the 1.5% to 2% inflation assumption on revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6666)|
| 1:51:10| growth, and that's probably why you're seeing here that these numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| are going to be a little bit higher than what Jim said his current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| annual budget is for maintenance projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| And that's what I needed to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6679)|
| 1:51:21| So you're saying the history from 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6681)|
| 1:51:24| the growth indicates that if we track that way that this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6684)|
| 1:51:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| And we did that for all of the categories, not just maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| We looked at what you guys have historically spent on sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| projects, roadway widening projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6695)|
| 1:51:38| And we went through the nitty-gritty of every single CIP all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| back to 2008, classified the project by its type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| and then calculated the amount you were spending year over year for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6704)|
| 1:51:48| each of those project types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6710)|
| 1:51:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6711)|
| 1:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6713)|
| 1:51:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6714)|
| 1:51:55| Just one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6715)|
| 1:51:56| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6716)|
| 1:51:57| Scoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6717)|
| 1:51:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| On the 476 pages of the draft appendices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6722)|
| 1:52:08| there was very extensive citizen input in there for the comprehensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6728)|
| 1:52:13| land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| How many of those recommendations made it into the 82-page plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6736)|
| 1:52:24| A percentage, two or three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| I don't think I can provide you with a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| What I can tell you is that we've looked at all of the comments that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| received, and as we noted earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6758)|
| 1:52:41| this was a three-phase public process along with additional phases for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| committee participation and presentations to commissions and various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| other boards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| And so it was really an iterative process that as we received feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| we looked at the feedback within each phase, kind of drew conclusions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| And you can see those kind of summaries of what that feedback was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| as you mentioned in the appendix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| And those were all used to inform how we were advancing to the next step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| within the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| So, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6793)|
| 1:53:14| I can't give you a specific percentage because they were really used by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6794)|
| 1:53:17| looking at each individual comment and then also looking at the comments in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| aggregate so that we could understand what we were kind of hearing from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| public in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6803)|
| 1:53:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6805)|
| 1:53:26| So you feel like the input from the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| they can feel like it was received and acted on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6808)|
| 1:53:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6812)|
| 1:53:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| I think that one of the things that I would commend staff on, and, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| we do have a chance to do this in many different places in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| but staff has done a great job of being very transparent and kind of keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| folks in the loop of how we progress through this process and then feeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| those results back to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| We want to be as visible and as transparent through this as we can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| because folks are giving us their time and input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| And so, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6839)|
| 1:54:00| it has been a very intentional collaborative process between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6840)|
| 1:54:03| consultant staff and then also county and planning staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6843)|
| 1:54:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6847)|
| 1:54:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6848)|

| 1:54:10| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6850)|
| 1:54:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6851)|
| 1:54:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker, to respond to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6852)|
| 1:54:15| I've had the privilege of sitting with many of these folks and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| leadership team and actually sitting in front of multiple screens and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| reading through hundreds of comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| even down to the address and pulling them up and having discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6869)|
| 1:54:30| So there has been a very good effort to really respond to as many of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6870)|
| 1:54:37| those as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| So I commend our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| I commend our consultants for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| And, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6884)|
| 1:54:45| really thank you for allowing me sometimes to kind of insert myself into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| some of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| But I just wanted to really quickly, and you all have heard these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| but just touch on some of the things from the time we started working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| this and some of the concessions that we have made just over the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6898)|
| 1:55:01| couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6901)|
| 1:55:02| I think it's important to kind of, to show that to your point again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker, that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6906)|
| 1:55:08| we are trying to listen to as many many advocacy groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| as many citizen comments as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| But just, just wanted to hit on a few of those, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| the total expanded plan growth area was actually reduced from what was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| originally presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| And it includes 14.501 acres total for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6926)|
| 1:55:31| So I think that's important to get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| We also were able to pull back some of the proposed grant growth areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6933)|
| 1:55:38| into the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6938)|
| 1:55:40| And we did that in Gibbs, Tazewell Pike, Ridgeview Heights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6940)|
| 1:55:45| Luttrell, in Rita, and some in Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| We also were able to limit rezonings allowed in the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| We were also able to add a rural agricultural place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| which is something that I, I really advocated for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6959)|
| 1:56:03| We also were able to amend the future land use map to include more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| rural living place types that will reduce density in areas with rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| And that includes the Choteau North Shore Peninsula as just as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| We were able to place conditions on types of residential development in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| the rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| We restricted business parks or industry in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Believe it or not, we could do that now, which blows my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6986)|
| 1:56:31| And then something that was important to me was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6991)|
| 1:56:33| we're going to be able to strengthen the focus of the impact on schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| and place the burden on the applicant during the application process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=6997)|
| 1:56:41| justify the change for a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| You know, that's something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| I heard during the planning commission workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| several of the planning commissioners were really pushing for a bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| focus and a bigger part on, from them about the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7014)|
| 1:57:00| And that's what kind of started my journey, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7020)|
| 1:57:02| all those years ago was the impact of growth and development on my kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7022)|
| 1:57:06| schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| So I'm glad that we'll be able to see some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| I know we're, you know, this isn't perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| It's not going to make everyone happy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7033)|
| 1:57:18| but kind of to echo what commissioner Jay said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7038)|
| 1:57:22| we cannot continue to do things the way that we're doing them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| We just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| So I'm still working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7051)|
| 1:57:36| I know we're all working on this and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7056)|

| 1:57:40| especially with me because I tend to ask a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| So I want to thank you for kind of bearing with me and touching on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240321-2?start=7063)|
