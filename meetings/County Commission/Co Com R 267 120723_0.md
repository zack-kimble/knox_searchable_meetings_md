| 0:02:54| 10205 Kingston Pike, suite number 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| I'm going to ask you some questions about your beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| Have you or any of your employees at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=189)|
| 0:03:13| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| or a crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=198)|
| 0:03:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=202)|
| 0:03:24| And we believe there has been a license before, but it's dated, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=204)|
| 0:03:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=207)|
| 0:03:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| And this is for on premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| And do you own the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| And do you lease it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| From whom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=218)|
| 0:03:39| I guess a company called Green 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| It's all property management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| And are you going to operate the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| Do you run the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Are you familiar with the Knox County and Tennessee beer laws and regulations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=231)|
| 0:03:55| And do you agree to conduct your business in conformity with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| Have you completed a server training program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=240)|
| 0:04:03| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=243)|
| 0:04:04| You did complete that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=246)|
| 0:04:07| I'm going to ask our staff some questions now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| Health department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=249)|
| 0:04:11| Sheriff's department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=251)|
| 0:04:12| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=252)|
| 0:04:13| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=253)|
| 0:04:14| Got a problem with the 330 feet to residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=259)|
| 0:04:20| Fire marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| Sir, do you have a liquor by the drink permit from the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=263)|
| 0:04:28| Yeah, I talked to the lady on the beer bowl, and I got the application ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=268)|
| 0:04:35| I'm working on an application for a wine permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=278)|
| 0:04:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| Commissioners, at this stage, there are only two ways you can grant a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| albeit you can do it conditionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=285)|
| 0:04:47| is one that he gets a variance or an alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=287)|
| 0:04:51| gets a state-issued liquor by the drink license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| Until either of those occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| the most you can do is tentatively approve this pending one of those two scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| I'll make a motion to postpone until he gets his liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| Motion has been made in seconded discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=309)|
| 0:05:11| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| If that beer license has lapsed, is there no grandfathering there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| If it's been more than six months, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| If it had been within six months, then it would be a different scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| But at this point, it's been over six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| With alcohol having been served there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| and I think that am I correct in that that strip has other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=337)|
| 0:05:41| or that stretch has other businesses that do, in fact, serve beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| What's it located next to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Kinko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| No, I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=352)|
| 0:05:54| There's a BP right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=354)|
| 0:05:56| Yeah, BP and Kinko.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| The BP doesn't have beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=358)|
| 0:06:00| The BP has a separate property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=360)|
| 0:06:01| You said it doesn't have beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| I see your points, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| Normally, well, the way the state code reads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=366)|
| 0:06:09| if there had been an active permit within the six-month period, it's a grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| And then you grant the permit, but that permit has long lapsed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| So now he's got to be treated like a new applicant now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=377)|
| 0:06:20| So he's either going to have to get a variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| or in the alternative get a liquor by the drink permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| which then entitles him to a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we give him a temporary variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| until he either gets property zoned correctly or a state-issued liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=391)|
| 0:06:42| Legally, you really can't grant a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| A variance has to go through the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| and you couldn't modify that property temporarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| They would have to go through the application process, pay for that, and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| My point is, were you to do that, somebody can challenge it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| If they challenge it, it would be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=417)|
| 0:07:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| We can give him a temporary license, though, can't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=421)|
| 0:07:04| Conditional license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=424)|
| 0:07:05| Conditional license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=425)|
| 0:07:06| We say pending all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| I would like to give him a temporary license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| I'll shut up at that point, and you can put whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=433)|
| 0:07:17| We can add whatever additional legal words we need to put on the back of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| but I would like to issue this business a temporary license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| That still violates the setback rule from the residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=445)|
| 0:07:31| I thought I heard the law director say initially in his initial conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| after the discussion that commission could issue a temporary license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| Pending, either getting a license from the state or a variance from the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=462)|
| 0:07:50| I thought that's what I heard, too, but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| Well, no, what I'm saying is in his situation, since there's no grandfather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=473)|
| 0:07:58| the two ways to get a license would either be to get a state license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| which entitles them to a beer license, or get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| Can you conceivably issue a temporary beer permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| You'd have to put some parameters on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| It would have to be conditioned before you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| So basically we can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| It would be subject to challenge if you did that because he doesn't meet the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=499)|
| 0:08:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| Why are we even voting on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| I don't think we need to delay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| There's nothing to delay, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| You could give him a license or you could hold him pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| just like if he was awaiting an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| If he got his state permit in two or three weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=524)|
| 0:08:46| he could then come up and get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| I mean, but if we did nothing, he can do absolutely the exact same thing, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| Well, he'd have to get back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| I mean, it's not going to save him much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| It may save him a couple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| It may take whatever the lapse time in getting on the agenda and being at this meeting versus, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| if you gave him one pending his state granting him a liquor license, it may happen within a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| And that would give him another month that he doesn't have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| Do you understand what we're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Yes, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| How far along are you in the process of getting your liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| Normally take three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=567)|
| 0:09:29| Three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| Two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| How long did you apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| Did you apply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| I got there last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| I only got a call before a week and I work on an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| So you haven't turned it in yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Probably today or tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=582)|
| 0:09:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| Are you open for business now or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Yeah, we're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| The motion on the floor is to delay for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=592)|
| 0:09:56| Just to make it clear with the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| there's really no way we can give him a license so he can sell beer pending his liquor license from the state or a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=598)|
| 0:10:08| Yeah, because, again, what happens if either is denied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=608)|
| 0:10:13| Then, you know, you've got a beer license that's been improperly issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| Then you have to revoke it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| It puts him in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| It puts you in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| And the motion is to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| To postpone until he gets his state liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| Postpone until the or a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| So that's the motion on the floor and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=633)|
| 0:10:35| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=635)|

| 0:10:39| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| So, sir, we hope to see you back, but you'll need to give either your variance or your liquor license first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=645)|

| 0:14:01| Defer to the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=841)|

| 0:14:03| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=843)|

| 0:14:09| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=850)|
| 0:14:11| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| Just one thing, Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| You know, we use the term temporary beer permit, but the way our code and the state laws design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| that's really temporary beer permits are for special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=857)|
| 0:14:22| They have a certain function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| Let's say, you know, one of the service clubs wants to hold a bazaar or something and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| want us to have beer, but that's what a temporary beer permit is designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| It's not really designed for a stopgap measure to give the person a chance to come into conformity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| Any other business to come before this beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| If not, we are in recess until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=882)|
| 0:15:00| It is 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=900)|
| 0:15:01| I would like to call into session this portion of our meeting where we have public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| and honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| A number of people have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| When I say a number of people, we have a handful of people, I should say, who have signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| to talk about 287G and also the prayer resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| We would like to get to you when we address those because we have a number of people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=917)|
| 0:15:22| we want to give everybody an equal opportunity to discuss that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| So when we get to that item on the agenda, we'll be asking you to come forward to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| Is there anyone who wants to address the commission on an item other than 287G, other than prayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=929)|
| 0:15:35| and anything that is not on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| If you would like to come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=939)|
| 0:15:45| And if you would give us your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| My name is George Hamilton, 2812 Greenway Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee, of course, 37918.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=949)|
| 0:15:59| And I addressed you people the other day when you were having all the ins and outs about the school budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| and I bragged on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| I said that these people have been elected to run the county's business and I said we ought to leave them alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| but I'm up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| The county is eat up with every kind of problem imaginable to human beings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| and I don't see any relief from your people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| I wrote you a letter and I don't know if I can read it in that length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| I didn't have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| By the time I got parked, rode the bus and got the copies of it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| Well, that's about prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=999)|
| 0:16:41| But I want you to look at the serious problems, all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| You've got a bunch of grown men here on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1005)|
| 0:16:49| Well, I mean, I'm including you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| You've been here a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| Where is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| It's a one lady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| She's probably the only one who's got enough nerve to take care of the problem we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1018)|
| 0:17:03| And there's endless problems, and I want you all to start working on these problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| instead of worrying about somebody getting up here and saying a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| If prayer works, we wouldn't even be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| All would be taken care of, and that is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| It is not taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| I want to give you a perfect example, and this is a personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| Our beach party team of ten boys and an officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| were getting ready to go into the beach at Okinawa, Japan on the invasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| The skipper of our ship said, anybody who wants to go to church service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| said we're going to have church service in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| My buddy Bill Gavin from New York City said, George, are you going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| I said, no, I'm not going, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| He said, well, why don't you go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| I said, because my mother down on Bob Gray Road right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| is praying every single day of her life about three boys that she's got in the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| And you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1087)|
| 0:18:09| She's praying for us to be home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| You know where I'm at, don't you, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| And if you don't get that message, you better catch on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1094)|
| 0:18:18| I am not home on Bob Gray Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| I'm out here in the ocean getting ready to go into Japan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1101)|
| 0:18:25| And I said, you can go and pray if you want to, but I don't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1105)|
| 0:18:29| You guys get to work, and you ladies push them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1109)|
| 0:18:32| because that's the only way you're going to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| Every day, push them, especially the leader up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1114)|
| 0:18:42| Mike's got a lot on him, but I'll tell you what, he can handle it, so put it on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| And I ain't going to play you no music because you don't deserve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| We appreciate your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| We have a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1134)|
| 0:18:56| Clerk, if you'd read that into the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| A resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1140)|
| 0:19:03| honoring the Gibbs High School softball team for winning the state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1143)|
| 0:19:06| This is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1146)|
| 0:19:08| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| And Commissioner Wright is making his way to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1154)|
| 0:19:15| And, Commissioner, when you get there, you'll be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1155)|
| 0:19:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| Really, it would be better if I had given you the Knoxville News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| and let you do what I'm about to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| because the Knoxville News Sentinel recognized Prep Extra Softball's first team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1173)|
| 0:19:41| This is off of the Gibbs High School girls softball teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1181)|
| 0:19:47| How does she say her first name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| Dani.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1188)|
| 0:19:50| Dani Jefferson, junior, shortstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| Megan Farmer, senior, first base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1194)|
| 0:19:57| Savannah Foster, junior, catcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| And I have to pause there for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| because my dad's farm and her back fence align each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| so she's really a neighbor of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| Faith Lowry, freshman outfielder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1211)|
| 0:20:15| Samantha Smith, senior, pitcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| And then if I go below the fold, Prep Extra's second team, Cheyenne Bowles, infielder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1218)|
| 0:20:26| All of these girls are at Gibbs, a long tradition of playing well in girls softball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| And I believe we have another announcement or also to follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| Just the other day, there were some girls named to the All-State team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1238)|
| 0:20:43| and those were Samantha Smith, senior, pitcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| Dani Jefferson, junior, shortstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1248)|
| 0:20:50| Savannah Foster, junior, catcher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| And Faith Lowry, freshman, outfielder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| So on behalf of Knox County Commission, I present this to the girls softball team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1257)|
| 0:21:12| I would like to say just a few words on behalf of the girls and our school and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| We really appreciate you all recognizing the girls for their hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1278)|
| 0:21:24| And nobody really knows until they're in it how hard they have to work to reach the top of their sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1284)|
| 0:21:32| And these girls reached the top of their sport,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| the only team that could say that they won their last game of the season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| We've also had great support from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| The Rutan Club has helped us pay for some of our expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| It's not free to go to the state tournament and to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Every day costs a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| So we did get a lot of support from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| And on our ride back, we had some gracious policemen who gave us a police escort all the way to Gibbs High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1321)|
| 0:22:10| which seems like a long way for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| But we went from one end of the county to the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| and we had a great community support of people there to cheer the girls on as we came into the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| So we really appreciate your all's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1344)|
| 0:22:27| Would you like to recognize each of the young women that you have there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1347)|
| 0:22:30| Sure, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1350)|

| 0:22:39| Savannah Foster, which we've heard her name a couple of times already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| She's a junior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Lexi Needham, freshman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1365)|

| 0:25:52| but they wanted to come down and see what a local legislative body looked like in the United States,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| and there's no better one than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1556)|

| 0:26:59| Ask you to go with us through this coming week and forgive us where we failed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1619)|
| 0:27:02| These things we ask in Christ's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1623)|

| 0:27:18| and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1638)|

| 0:27:35| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1655)|

| 0:27:40| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Do we have any amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| One amendment is on line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Finance Department has asked that page five be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| Are there other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| I'd like to make sure that the MPC ordinance was deferred 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| There are two items for MPC with regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| And one was deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| There's another one there that has not been deferred for 30 days with regards to zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Which one was the ordinance on the hilltop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| On page 13, well, let's see, on page 12, there's a zoning request for B-12-0A with regards to a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1696)|
| 0:28:25| That one has not been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Under item C, amendments 0-12-0-101 has been deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| Those will be hard at six, but I'd like to ask for both of those to be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1716)|
| 0:28:41| Mr. Law Director, can we go ahead and defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| We can defer now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| So you're asking that those be deferred 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Yes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| Just in regards to both of those, Mr. Donaldson was not able to speak to that at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| So if we could, I'd like to at least hear from him in terms of a discussion item about that deferral process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1739)|
| 0:29:08| So we will have a discussion item, but the items themselves will be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| Yes, I need to defer 902, please, for one more month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| I still have not had an opportunity to meet with the trustee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| I'll be doing that in the next 10 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1767)|
| 0:29:30| Item 902 will be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| As we were talking there, Commissioner Norman was talking of discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| I'd like for us to have a discussion item related to charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| And then also the 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| Item 201 is not starred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| Does that mean we're going to talk about 201?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1793)|
| 0:29:57| No, under our agreement, they will go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| Even though there was a negative vote, it will still go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1799)|
| 0:30:05| We cannot pull it is what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| You can ask a question on it after we have voted, but we can't pull it off for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1812)|
| 0:30:13| We can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1813)|
| 0:30:14| Yes, you can ask a question afterwards, but we can't pull it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| And also then 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1817)|

| 0:30:23| I thought at the last discussion that we could only discuss the educational items in the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| Yes, we were, but Superintendent McIntyre said he wasn't here, but that he would be here today if we wanted to ask any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1830)|
| 0:30:36| Am I accurate in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1836)|
| 0:30:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1837)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| But this is simply because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1841)|

| 0:30:44| I just also had a question on a clarification on things that are on the education agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1844)|
| 0:30:50| Do we vote for those as a group?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| I mean, we can discuss them, even if it's at the workshop where we're supposed to discuss them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Can we vote something down there or is that just something that's just a pass through for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Yeah, because I had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| That's more symbolic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| That's a symbolic vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| Commissioner Burroughs, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1868)|
| 0:31:12| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1872)|

| 0:31:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| I thought because there was a dissenting vote on that 201 that it would not be on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| that we still talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| No, it's education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1904)|

| 0:31:47| It's education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| We can do a symbolic vote, but it's education consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| We can ask questions, and we'll do that after we've voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=1911)|

| 0:40:48| If you'd go ahead and just talk about it and the concept of it and why you're all behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2448)|
| 0:40:53| Sure. Jim McIntyre. I'm at 912 South Gay Street, Superintendent of Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| We're talking about the Breakfast in the Classroom program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| The basic idea is to provide breakfast to students in the classroom as they arrive at school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| It's a program that has been successful in some other school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| It's actually a partnership with the Knox County Education Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| who has actually been a very strong partner in identifying this opportunity and bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2478)|
| 0:41:23| And what has been seen in other school systems, particularly in some high-need schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| if you're able to provide breakfast in the classroom, you're going to see increases in attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| and positive academic outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| I think the basic idea is that if kids come to school hungry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| they're going to spend the first half of their school day not thinking about what they're learning, but thinking about lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| And this is one way to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| It's a relatively straightforward way to do that that doesn't create, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2513)|
| 0:41:58| feed the kids, let them begin their school day with a good, healthy meal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| and begin the learning process in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| We have two people here, Ms. Sherry Morgan, who is the President of the Knox County Education Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2528)|
| 0:42:13| and Mr. Don Dickel, who is our Director of Food and Nutrition Services for Children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| both of whom could speak probably to the details if you have detailed questions about it, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2538)|
| 0:42:24| Yeah, typically they'll be eating in the classroom, as the name suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| But let me defer to Mr. Dickel in terms of the operational aspects of this and how this will actually work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| Hi, John Dickel, 1530 Bexel Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| There's going to be a couple different methods of delivery for the students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| depending on the challenges of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| We may do a kiosk or cart at the top level and take products up to the kiosk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2569)|
| 0:42:54| where the students would grab the product from the kiosk as they go to the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| The predominant method would involve having coolers that would go to the room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| and as the students come in, they pick their items out of the cooler and sit down at their desk and consume the meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| So they're going to walk through the house carrying it, or is it going to be at the classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| Everything that they need in that cooler, including napkins, silverware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| things that they would need to consume it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2599)|
| 0:43:24| We'll provide wipes and things like that in the classroom, so if there's any kind of spill or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2604)|
| 0:43:29| that they'll be prepared to take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| Here's one of my questions and or concerns, Dr. McIntyre, and I've gotten several, not a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| but if we're at 357,000, that's for some 17 schools, then next year we're going to be taking that over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| so we're sort of looking at an unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| But what concerns me more, too, is we're at 17 schools, and you've got how many schools, 88, about 88-something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| so that's just going to keep getting bigger and bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| That's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2641)|
| 0:44:07| I have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| I really don't want to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I mean, it's already passed, but I've got a problem with, you know, where are the parents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| Why aren't they taking care of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| And if they say, well, we can't, you know, we can't afford it, well, if you can't afford it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| then you're getting food stamps and you can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| So it's just and I'm concerned about the unfunded mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| It's, like, getting bigger and bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| This animal's going to get bigger because most everything, this 357,000, it's strictly for materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| not anything for food at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| And Commissioner and Mr. Dickel can speak to this better than I can, but this is a grant of $357,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2674)|
| 0:44:41| So this is money that's coming to us for the purpose of sort of building the infrastructure for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2681)|
| 0:44:46| I think it's intended to really target some of our higher-need schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2686)|
| 0:44:51| And I think, you know, as I understand, there was some discussion last week about the role of the parent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2691)|
| 0:44:56| and the social aspects of it, and I understand that, and I respect that sort of perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| But I also know that we have the reality is we have some kids that come to school hungry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2702)|
| 0:45:05| and this is a way for us as a school system and for us as a community to be able to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| You know, regardless of the cause, regardless of how that happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| to address that and make sure that when a student comes to the classroom, they're ready to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| that they're ready to succeed, they're ready to achieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2720)|
| 0:45:22| And that's really my primary goal and objective and my perspective on the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2722)|
| 0:45:27| My understanding is that these are, and I don't want to get too far on a limb here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| but I believe these are reimbursable meals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| And so it should be a self-funded program going forward because of the federal hot lunch program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2732)|
| 0:45:37| and the reimbursement that we get through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| Is that correct, Mr. Dixon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Well, I don't want any child to come to school hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2740)|
| 0:45:43| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| But as it is now, can they come to school and you put them in the cafeteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2744)|
| 0:45:48| In other words, if you've got five to ten percent of your school population for any school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| that comes to school hungry, but yet we're feeding the other 90 to 85 percent of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| is there a way we can identify who those hungry people are and take care of their needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| The way that the program is designed, it is a kickstart program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| The grant is actually a kickstart program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| It helps you with infrastructure issues, equipment, supplies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2772)|
| 0:46:18| Out of the 17 schools, 11 that were selected were in the 80 percent or greater economically needy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| The remaining 6 percent fall between 70 percent and 79 percent based on this year's number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| Trending, the way that it's trending, I see those numbers probably going a little higher this coming school year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| once we are able to receive that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| But are you feeding them breakfast now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Right now we're feeding a fraction of those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| I can think of one school that is somewhere in the 87 percentile that we feed about one-fifth of the student body breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2803)|
| 0:46:51| However, that school actually has 87 percent economically needy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| So the assumption is that there is a far greater number of students that we're not reaching with breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2814)|
| 0:46:59| Of course, the students can decline breakfast, and we are required to have a system that ensures that only one student receives it per meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2819)|
| 0:47:09| So we have rosters for the classrooms to ensure that all of the students that are selecting the meal are checked off on the roster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| And this is my last thing, and I'll be quiet about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| You've got item 201, then we jump down to 203, and it's 12.4, and this is three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| So we're almost at $13 million looking for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| How are we going to absorb that into the budget for this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2846)|
| 0:47:32| You've got a grant here for $12.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Yeah, and I know we're going to have some questions about item 203, which is the federal IDEA grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2854)|
| 0:47:40| That's what's referred to as an entitlement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2860)|
| 0:47:46| It's for students with disabilities, and so that's not a one-time $12 million grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| That has been an ongoing grant, although there are certainly some funding issues and challenges in Washington, D.C., right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2870)|
| 0:47:57| and there could be some reductions to funding in programs like federal Title I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA, which is item number 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| But that's not a one-time grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| That's an ongoing commitment by the federal government to support the education of students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2889)|
| 0:48:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Just a quick question, and you touched on it, Mr. Dickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| Is this supplemental in addition to free and reduced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| What it is, the grant really provides about three-fourths of the money provided for equipment purchases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| refrigeration that's required to be able to perform these meals in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| It actually even provides some equipment support for custodial as well, because custodial will be one of our partners in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2917)|
| 0:48:46| From the sustainability of it after the grant monies have ended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2926)|
| 0:48:54| we still will receive reimbursements for our free and reduced students at breakfast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| In addition to that, we have really maximized organizational efficiencies over the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| that we are able to support any change in the grant income coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| We can support through operational efficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Of course, we are on a separate budget line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| We operate financially independent based solely on our reimbursements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| We operate very much like a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| Dr. McIntyre has made it very clear to me that I am not to ever come to him for education dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2965)|
| 0:49:30| And I believe that's the way we need to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| And so we operate very much like a business with a high corporate social responsibility for taking care of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| So I would never dream of ever trying to support any program that we implement in school nutrition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| with local dollars that are earmarked for education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| So this allows you to better implement free and reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| I'm saying that right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2994)|
| 0:49:55| It's indirectly supplemental because it's hardware to aid you in the free and reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=2995)|
| 0:50:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3002)|
| 0:50:03| And, you know, the grant dollars enable me to better execute our lunch program too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3003)|
| 0:50:08| because of the fact that it will help us improve our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Dr. McIntyre, 17 schools, how many teachers are involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3017)|
| 0:50:24| Commissioner, I don't have those numbers off the top of my head,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| but we can certainly provide that to you in terms of how many teachers are in those 17 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| When does the school day start for those teachers that would be involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| So it depends on the level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| It's all elementary schools though, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| This is all elementary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3041)|
| 0:50:42| I believe it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| No, I believe there's – Mr. Jekyll tells me there's middle schools and high schools as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3045)|
| 0:50:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| So middle schools start at 830?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| Middle schools typically start at 830, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| So if you had this program in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| when would the teachers be required to start their day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| I don't believe there's a change in terms of their responsibility in terms of the teacher work day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| What changes is that the students will have access to a breakfast meal at the beginning of the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3068)|
| 0:51:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3075)|
| 0:51:16| So contract time changes nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| It should not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3079)|
| 0:51:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| And, again, you know, this is a partnership with the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| That's the local teachers association here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| This initiative actually came from a partnership with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| They identified this as a potential resource that we embraced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| And so it appears to me that, you know, our teachers will be receptive to it because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| It appears that they'll be receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| But are they receptive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| That would be my question, that the teachers that are involved or are going to be involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| have they been surveyed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| Were they asked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| Were they incorporated into the process of you planning this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| And if they were, what were their responses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Well, I don't believe we did a survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| But I would, you know, I don't know if Ms. Morgan is still in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| It might be nice to hear from her on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3124)|
| 0:52:07| But the Knox County Education Association has been involved in every step of this process along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3127)|
| 0:52:14| And that's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| That's good to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| But I am concerned about the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| The normal day starts in a rather frantic way anyway for most teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| And to add breakfast responsibilities to their normal day, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3144)|
| 0:52:29| is something that really should be carefully considered, as you evidently are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| But I'm just thinking about their task at hand, which is monumental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3155)|
| 0:52:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| And I would say I would agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| And I think that we have carefully considered that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3163)|
| 0:52:45| And I think one of the things that is important to me, as I mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3165)|
| 0:52:50| is that there's minimal disruption at the beginning of the school day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| And sort of looking at the cost-benefit of being able to provide a student with a healthy breakfast at the beginning of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| I think really can make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| And, you know, from your teaching experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| can really make a difference in terms of allowing a student to be focused on learning rather than distracted by that hunger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3186)|
| 0:53:12| And I think that that benefit is certainly, I believe, worth the work that we've put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3192)|
| 0:53:19| and the requirements that are going to be put in place, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3199)|
| 0:53:23| which I think will be minimal on teachers in terms of operationalizing this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3203)|
| 0:53:28| Ms. Morgan, would you like to address us on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| Maybe give us your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3210)|
| 0:53:32| Sherry Morgan, 1712 Penwood Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3212)|
| 0:53:35| I'm president of the Knox County Education Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| And before this was even started, I did talk to teachers that were doing breakfast in the classroom at some of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| The feedback has been very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| A lot of the teachers said it just cuts down on distractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| Behavior is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| They're calmer in the morning instead of going to the cafeteria, which can usually be very loud in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3230)|
| 0:53:55| They're calmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3235)|
| 0:53:56| They're able to get their day started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| They got to school at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| If they were to be there at 8 o'clock, they were there at 8 o'clock, and the kids started breakfast then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3241)|
| 0:54:05| And they had a lot of good benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| One concern I heard from teachers was they wanted the garbage bags to be stronger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| because after they put all the trash in there, sometimes the garbage bags weren't stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| But I did talk to teachers before we even started implementing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Well, thanks, Ms. Morgan, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| And you know where my heart is about extra responsibilities on teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| The students are the ones that bear the brunt of that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3270)|
| 0:54:34| when you burden your teachers with more than what they can handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| So it's good to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| It's good to know that they're evidently on board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| But I hope also that you'll keep close touch with how this program progresses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| and that, of course, it doesn't become a burden to the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| and therefore a detriment to the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| I just had one very quick question because someone wrote me a letter about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| The grant money that we receive on all of these things on the educational consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| are any of these factored into our maintenance of effort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| And this really gets back to the unfunded mandate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| It's just a general generic question about the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3319)|
| 0:55:23| My understanding is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| If you're talking about federal grants that are coming from a separate source of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| that maintenance of effort speaks only to the general fund that's appropriated by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3328)|
| 0:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3336)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| Are you going to feed every kid in the class?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| For those schools that have been identifying the grant, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| If they select a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Only if they select a meal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| They can decline the meal if they'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| My concern would have been if you're segregating the poor kids from the rest of the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| are they going to be looked down on because they're getting a free meal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3363)|
| 0:56:08| for breakfast here and there if they're not getting it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3368)|
| 0:56:10| Also on your list there, you list two different categories,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| large materials and small materials or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| I'm assuming the small materials is a cooler because it's the same for every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3384)|
| 0:56:25| But there's a big disparity in the dollar spent for some of the schools for the large expenditure column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3385)|
| 0:56:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| What comes under large expenditures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Large may be carts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Large could be refrigeration units, freezers, coolers, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3399)|
| 0:56:47| Because there were several partners that were involved in the program, the Food and Resource Action Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| the KCEA through the NEA, the Walmart Foundation, School Nutrition Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3412)|
| 0:57:00| And one of the things that they tried to factor was the investment that was required per student enrolled at the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| So what we tried to do is we tried to factor maybe a lower enrollment school versus a higher enrollment school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| and what we thought we could qualify for that school through the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| So you could see some disparity between the equipment that was purchased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3435)|
| 0:57:19| the larger equipment that was more expensive at some schools than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3439)|
| 0:57:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3443)|
| 0:57:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3444)|
| 0:57:25| Mr. Smith, do you have something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Just one last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| You're going to save some money in this because you're doing some of the kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| which already about how much money do you think that you'll save this year or next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| that you'll be able to put back in the superintendent's budget or wherever that money is going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3456)|
| 0:57:42| Well, our budget is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| We are required to reinvest in our program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| We're not allowed to put money back in the superintendent's budget other than what we pay for expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3467)|
| 0:57:51| and we do pay expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| We pay utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3472)|
| 0:57:53| We pay for our own cost of benefits, salaries, cost of goods sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3473)|
| 0:57:59| We pay for part of some of the positions that support our organization, also our department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| So we put money back towards the – we pay for our own waste removal, pest control, things of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| So how much is it put back in your budget then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| At this point, I've not quantified exactly what I can anticipate back in our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3493)|
| 0:58:18| I would tell you that we've had two very good years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| and we've been investing a lot more in our infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| Two years ago, we spent $150,000 on new equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| We spent over $800,000 this year, and we've been very financially solvent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| So we're doing very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| If you ever get that information, that would be just good to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| Yes, sir, I'd be happy to share that with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| Clerk, let's move on to the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| On Page 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| Mr. Chairman, wasn't 203 part of the – we haven't finished with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Mr. McIntyre, there's still some questions on Item 203.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| I thought we'd address both together, but we still have some further questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3545)|
| 0:59:08| I appreciate your indulgence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| Who has the first question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3555)|
| 0:59:17| I didn't hustle out of the room fast enough, is that what you're telling me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3557)|
| 0:59:20| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| But we're both dressed really well, see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| Indeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| We must have got in the same clothes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| That's a very sharp tie, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| It's about like yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| The reason that I guess this is getting some attention, and we're going back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| I would say, like the 201, the question was asked first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| It's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| It's a grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| And how does it affect us ongoing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| So then we've gone off to then reading all of the other items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| I guess there are probably 10 or 12 items that are related to the school system here before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| as a part of the educational consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| And I guess that we're asking, or I am, it's my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3599)|
| 1:00:05| and I'm using 203 as an example, and I believe you said something about it earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| the $12 million that's in 203 is federal money for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3610)|
| 1:00:21| What might those dollars have been last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3621)|
| 1:00:24| And I just asked that question because it's probably $12 million or in that ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3624)|
| 1:00:29| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3629)|
| 1:00:30| It's roughly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| If I recall, and I can certainly get the commission those exact figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| but if I recall, it's about the same, maybe a slight decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3634)|
| 1:00:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| So that's just trying to find the tracking of it's a year-over-year grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| government grant for education of a certain class of our school population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3644)|
| 1:00:52| What if that money is not there next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3652)|
| 1:00:55| I believe that's where the question is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3655)|
| 1:00:58| Is that $12 million considered a part of our maintenance of effort if it were not there next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3658)|
| 1:01:05| I believe that's the blunt question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3665)|
| 1:01:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| That people are asking me, and I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3669)|
| 1:01:10| So that gets into a question of what, again, my understanding of maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3670)|
| 1:01:18| from the perspective that we all have been talking about it is really maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| with regard to the general fund appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| And the basic idea in state statute and regulation is that if a county commission appropriates a certain level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3686)|
| 1:01:36| of funding for public education in a general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3696)|
| 1:01:40| that that number could not be reduced in a subsequent year unless there were significant changes in enrollment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3700)|
| 1:01:47| That's my understanding of what we've sort of been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| We do have obligations and requirements in terms of how we support and educate students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3711)|
| 1:02:01| and many of those are encoded in federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| And so what the IDEA, or the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| is intended to do is intended to support and fund some of those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3731)|
| 1:02:19| So, I mean, I don't want to get into extreme hypotheticals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| but if the federal government were to, in a very unlikely scenario, cut the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3743)|
| 1:02:30| but continue the obligations and requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| then we would have to identify funding to continue to provide those services to students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| I think that's a very unlikely scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| IDEA has been around for many years, and we have benefited from that source of funds for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3761)|
| 1:02:49| And what it does is it pays for staffing, equipment, professional development and training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3769)|
| 1:02:54| in order to provide outstanding education to our students with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| and to enable us as a school system to make sure that we meet those obligations under federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3780)|
| 1:03:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| I view it to be a simple and straightforward question, and you've given me that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| The federal government has requirements, and in order to meet those requirements, they send $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| Which isn't enough to meet those requirements, but it's a good start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| But so we do, you know, within our general fund budget, we do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| we also pay for special education staff and training and equipment and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3811)|
| 1:03:36| But this is an effort on the part of the federal government to provide funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3816)|
| 1:03:42| to support the education of students with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| and the requirements that they put on us as obligations as school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3824)|
| 1:03:50| And it does provide, I think, very important resources to help us do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| And that money becomes entwined in the budget of what you spend on an annual basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3835)|
| 1:04:03| but it was not a part of what we funded as a part of the maintenance of effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| This $12 million is not part of the general fund appropriation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| that the county commission approved on June the 4th, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3854)|
| 1:04:17| And for the last week, there's been sort of a firestorm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3857)|
| 1:04:19| apparently because there are some other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| But I just wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3861)|
| 1:04:23| I am clear in my mind with the answer that you've given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3867)|
| 1:04:28| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3868)|
| 1:04:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Commissioner Olinby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3870)|
| 1:04:31| Yeah, just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3871)|
| 1:04:32| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| How many, this $12 million, how many students is this going to take care of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| Or how many do we have in the school system that are in special needs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Again, I'd have to give you a more detailed breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| We have, depending on how you define students with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3886)|
| 1:04:51| and how broadly you define that in terms of the services that are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| I believe we're somewhere around 12% to 15% of our students that have some form of services provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3896)|
| 1:05:03| But I'd really want to, rather than give you just a broad estimate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| I'd much rather provide that information to the commission in the form of precise figures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3906)|
| 1:05:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3912)|
| 1:05:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3913)|
| 1:05:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3914)|
| 1:05:15| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3915)|
| 1:05:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3917)|
| 1:05:19| This discussion has brought up a question I've had for a couple of weeks I've been meaning to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| and I suppose this is as good a time as any to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| All of these grants that are not part of the maintenance of effort budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3927)|
| 1:05:34| can we get a list of those for last year and projected for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3934)|
| 1:05:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| I've got your application for special ed services here in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3953)|
| 1:05:58| and I just had one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| In one part of it, in one section in the financial information section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| the first category in that is called adjustment to local effort in certain fiscal years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| And you have the option of marking yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| And in that category, in that description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| and I don't know if you can understand what this means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| but the sentence says if the local education unit wishes to reduce the MOE,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3982)|
| 1:06:31| it must be, you know, you must attach a form to calculate and so on the maximum amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3991)|
| 1:06:39| In your application, you mark no, you do not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| which I'm assuming that that means you do not wish to reduce the MOE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| Right, and so I didn't really want to go here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| but there's also a federal maintenance of effort requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| with regard to special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| And the reason I didn't want to, I sort of didn't use that terminology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| is because we've used that terminology for a specific meaning in this local context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4021)|
| 1:07:05| But there is a requirement, given the current requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4025)|
| 1:07:09| and obligations to educate students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| there is a maintenance of effort requirement for spending on special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| And that's what that really speaks to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| I guess I'd like to look at this thing a different way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| and maybe to clarify it for some or confuse it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| And please correct me if I'm not accurate with this statement, Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4056)|
| 1:07:42| There's a law on the books that says we need to do certain things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| for those students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| There's a law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4070)|
| 1:07:51| There's a federal law that says we have to do certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4071)|
| 1:07:54| There's an act out there that says we're going to fund that at some level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4074)|
| 1:07:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4079)|
| 1:08:00| There's a federal act that says you can apply for these grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| and we'll give you money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4085)|
| 1:08:06| That's an act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4086)|
| 1:08:07| That's a law as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| If this money goes away, we're still going to have to provide these services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4089)|
| 1:08:16| and upgrades for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| Then it will come out of our operational budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4099)|
| 1:08:23| and it might be at the cost of education and special programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4103)|
| 1:08:28| The law is not going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| There's never, and this is Sam's humble opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| but I'm sure a lot of people agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4113)|
| 1:08:35| there's never going to come a day where they're going to pass a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| and say, okay, you don't have to make your areas accessible to folks with handicaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| You don't have to provide special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| So that law is going to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| So that funding level, if the act goes away, they could say, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4127)|
| 1:08:52| make it 100% accessible in five years instead of 15 to 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| Then the funding profile has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| So I guess I'm looking at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| This is a grant, and that's exactly what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| It's a grant saying we're going to help you get to where you need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| to meet the objectives of this ADA law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| So, you know, as long as we're getting this money from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| that means we're not taking out of our local coffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| because we're going to provide those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| That's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| It should happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4168)|
| 1:09:29| But we don't really have a say in whether we'll make our facilities more accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| or we'll create these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| It's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Have I said anything that's really inaccurate in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Okay, so, you know, I'm looking at these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Yeah, they may go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| Then you best believe we're going to have to fund them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| either through capital outlays or if we choose not to give him maintenance of effort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4191)|
| 1:09:59| or above and beyond for these purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| then he's going to have to cut out of his educational budget that exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| So that's the bottom line, the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4206)|
| 1:10:09| I mean, this is good money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4209)|
| 1:10:10| I think we need to keep accepting this money because it will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| These goods and services will be provided to this 12% to 15% of our students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| that are special needs children, and it should be that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| So that's my take on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4229)|
| 1:10:30| Thank you, Superintendent McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4230)|

| 1:11:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| I just thought this was on a delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4306)|
| 1:11:53| Did we have a document added today from the Development Corporation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4313)|
| 1:11:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4320)|
| 1:12:01| I haven't had time to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4321)|
| 1:12:04| I think the contract, the resolution for the budget called for last year's contracts to be split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4324)|
| 1:12:10| and virtually the same contracts as last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| And if Dean is here, I may be, I don't know, or somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| But what they've done is they've taken out and redefined a few things about political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4336)|
| 1:12:23| and things like that that the mayor wanted added into the contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4343)|
| 1:12:28| and less on the Development Corporation and more on Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| It's virtually last year's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4352)|
| 1:12:35| If you want to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4355)|
| 1:12:36| That's my point is, you know, obviously I've got a question about political activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4356)|
| 1:12:41| and that's what I'm addressing, you know, in a later discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| So I guess I'd like a little definition of what those changes are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| Ben Charvel, Program Manager in Community Development, 400 Main.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| Commissioners, these contracts have been negotiated between the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| and the Innovation Valley, the chamber and Development Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| and obviously we received them as of Friday and got them on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4385)|
| 1:13:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| And the political activity, it was slightly rewritten in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4394)|
| 1:13:22| and so was some of the monitoring and record keeping clauses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| Do we have somebody from the mayor's office that could respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| Or from the law department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| Can you talk about details of this, changes in this particular contract, this $600,000 contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4419)|
| 1:13:51| What specifically are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4431)|
| 1:13:52| Political activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Well, the idea behind that is to ensure that public monies aren't used to vet a certain political aspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4435)|
| 1:14:01| but it's a standard form that we normally have in our contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| So were there changes that would ensure that we don't use public money for political activity within the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4445)|
| 1:14:14| Correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4454)|
| 1:14:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4455)|
| 1:14:16| And those were past legal muster, I assume?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Any other comments from the mayor's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| Is there anybody here from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Chris came down to say something to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| Let's see what he might have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| I mean, I'm just from a contractual basis, Chris, is what's the changes and what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4472)|
| 1:14:38| that's what we're looking for is an assurance that we're not mixing funds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4478)|
| 1:14:42| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4482)|
| 1:14:43| Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| I know that Dean Rice and David Luke worked on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| And as far as that portion of the contract, I know they put in some language from, I want to think it was the Hatch Dot Act| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4489)|
| 1:14:57| or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4497)|
| 1:14:58| David, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| What went in there was based on the experience that was a consideration by commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4501)|
| 1:15:08| and many citizens about the chamber or the development corporation coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4508)|
| 1:15:14| and taking a position on a hotly disputed political issue that involved taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| The verbiage that was put in there was pretty much boilerplate language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4520)|
| 1:15:26| It tightened up the language that was previously in there, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4526)|
| 1:15:31| And number two, it made clear because of the way it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| it made clear that an individual could, in the capacity as the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| not be pre-permitted from voicing his or her opinion on any political issue because that would be unconstitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4542)|
| 1:15:50| But to come forward representing the body, whether it be the development corporation or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4550)|
| 1:15:58| to take a position politically is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| And we tightened that language up, but we loosened it up to make sure that the individual could speak on their own behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4561)|
| 1:16:10| Those are the basic changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4570)|
| 1:16:11| But the considerations that some of the commissioners had and some of the public, I think, were tempted to be covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4571)|
| 1:16:21| They were negotiated between the mayor and those three organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| It may not have been the language I exactly wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| but it was negotiated out between them and it passes legal muster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4589)|
| 1:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| I'm like Commissioner Norman, just got this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| How much, what percentage of this is for, I guess, development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| and the other is for salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| I see time card here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| What percentage of this is for salary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| The total budget is $200,000 and, excuse me, is $600,000 from Rocks County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| Our budget for salaries expenses are $260,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4621)|
| 1:17:07| Out of the $600,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4627)|
| 1:17:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4628)|
| 1:17:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4629)|
| 1:17:10| What about the other, the $125,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4630)|
| 1:17:13| That's Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4633)|
| 1:17:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4634)|
| 1:17:15| I can't speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| And I want to clarify, this is development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| It's not Innovation Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| It's not Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| This is strictly Development Corp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| Todd, would you give us your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Todd Napier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4649)|

| 1:18:38| We want to give you the opportunity to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| You will have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4720)|

| 1:18:44| Lucille Griffo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| You'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| Lucille Griffo, 3326 Monmouth Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| And also thank you for the service that you are rendering to the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| You are elected lawmakers representing the citizens of Knox County and the state of Tennessee within the United States of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| To borrow from the preamble to the Constitution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| your job is an extension of the work necessary to promote the general welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| I don't believe that representing the interest of any particular religious group is required of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| But upholding the Constitution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| The doctrine of separation of church and state is a fundamental tenet of our form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| To provide an opportunity for public prayer in any form at a government function is to not only disrespect this doctrine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| but it disregards the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| I respect the need to call upon a higher power to guide one in behavior that affects other human beings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| But I believe a private petition is far more respectful than a public one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| And at the same time shows complete compliance with the First Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| I do not support the policy of religious observances at any government function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4811)|
| 1:20:12| Next is Larry Rhoades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4812)|
| 1:20:16| Mr. Rhoades, if you would give us your address for the record, sir, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| I appreciate your service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| My name is Larry Rhoades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4825)|
| 1:20:26| I'm 6105 John May Drive, Knoxville, 37921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| I'm a citizen of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| I have been for over 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| I graduated from the University of Tennessee here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4836)|
| 1:20:39| I'm a Vietnam-era veteran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| I worked here, owned homes here, and for 17 years ran my own business here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| I was born into a Southern Baptist home, raised Southern Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| But even though my religious views have changed over time, I was still a citizen of this county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4851)|
| 1:20:58| And as such, I expected my government to represent me as a citizen without injecting their own individual, personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4858)|
| 1:21:05| religious views into policies that govern my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| The First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which all of you swore to uphold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4870)|
| 1:21:16| forbids the making of any laws which represent an establishment of a religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| Therefore, you should be aware that if you vote on this and approve this, you may be voting on an unconstitutional act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4881)|
| 1:21:29| If it passes, it will be challenged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| It will cost the city and county a lot of time and a lot of money to defend, money of which we have very precious little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4892)|
| 1:21:42| Knox County was probably at one time 100 percent Christian and Baptist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| It is no longer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| It, and indeed all of America as a whole, is now a community made up of Baptists, Catholics, Methodists, Mormons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4910)|
| 1:21:59| as well as Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and nonbelievers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| Indeed, the category called Other in Knox County makes up nearly 30 percent of the population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4925)|
| 1:22:12| all of which are taxpaying citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| And as citizens, they have the right to be represented equally under the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| This board today votes on a policy of having religious prayer start the city-county meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| And you may very well vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| But if not, it will not be something that represents all of its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| It will be a specific prayer to a specific god of a specific religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| And even though you may deem it a generic prayer, it will still leave out humanists, secularists, agnostics, and atheists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4960)|
| 1:22:50| all of which are citizens of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4970)|
| 1:22:54| the segment of the population that, like it or not, is growing every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| You will be sending a message to those citizens, a message that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| You're not really citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| You're allowed to live here and pay taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| But real citizens are those who share the religious beliefs of us, the majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| This is not only un-American, but it can be the first step down the road of fascism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=4995)|
| 1:23:21| I'm not here to try to persuade you not to practice your religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| Please, practice your religion by all means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| On every street corner, in the churches, in the homes, in the closet, as Jesus would recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5008)|
| 1:23:35| or in the open air, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5015)|
| 1:23:38| But not in the halls of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5018)|
| 1:23:41| And not with the power of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| As a citizen of Knoxville and Knox County for over 40 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5024)|
| 1:23:49| I demand my right to be represented fairly under this government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| no matter what my religious belief is or whether I have one or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| You may think that you must be following your religious faith and do as it dictates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| However, religious faith has not been proven to be a good path to truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| If it were, there would not be thousands of different religions all over the planet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5050)|
| 1:24:15| all claimed to be following faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5055)|
| 1:24:18| Remember that the mother in Jonesboro who gave her child poison Kool-Aid was also following her faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5058)|
| 1:24:25| Those misguided Muslims who flew planes into the buildings of New York and Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| were following their faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| The members of the Branch Davidian in Waco, Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5073)|
| 1:24:36| when arming themselves and fighting the federal government through the last man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| were always following their faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5082)|
| 1:24:45| Faith and deeds allows you to believe anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Faith is the permission that you give yourself to ignore anything to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| Please, follow your conscience, but leave religion at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| and do not practice your religion for me in the halls of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| It is much better, by far, to follow the U.S. Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5104)|
| 1:25:07| and keep your religion out of government and to work for all religions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| to keep all religions out of government as well, ensuring true religious freedom in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5111)|
| 1:25:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Don Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| Sir, if you'd give us your address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| I think I'm grateful to be Don Thomas, 11309 Sonia Drive, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5130)|
| 1:25:36| With utmost respect for you, as an active Protestant pastor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5136)|
| 1:25:41| and retired military reserve chaplain, I offer these words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| I believe it is important and possible to have prayer at the beginning of a governmental meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5145)|
| 1:25:51| An invocation or a call to focus or a devotional, as you have called, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| offers a reminder for civility and strength in an area, in an arena known for divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5157)|
| 1:26:05| A public voicing of values and virtues critical for our community life is essential, I feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5165)|
| 1:26:13| and constitutionally valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| But such prayers would best be nonpartisan, nonpolitical, and nonsectarian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5176)|
| 1:26:22| to meet what I perceive to be the litmus test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| Such an important body as you should have your meetings framed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| not in a manner that reminds you of how separate you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5190)|
| 1:26:34| but in a historically rich tradition that calls to heart and mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5194)|
| 1:26:40| how together you are in working for the common good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5200)|
| 1:26:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| Jack Dean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| Sir, if you would give us your address and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| It's indeed a pleasure to have the opportunity to address this august body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| I'm not here for any controversial statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| I'm just here for a singular purpose of thanking you for standing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| for your convictions of invoking the blessings of God| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5237)|
| 1:27:22| and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ upon your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5242)|
| 1:27:28| And that's about as far as it reaches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| And I commend each one of you for standing for your convictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| in inviting the blessings of God upon your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5258)|
| 1:27:45| I do not see it as an evangelistic effort or a proselyting effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| but I see it as recognizing God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| in whom we all hopefully believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| Thank you for this privilege that you have given to me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5283)|
| 1:28:07| I will be praying for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5287)|
| 1:28:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| James, is it Theusen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| I apologize if I got that name incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5297)|
| 1:28:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5299)|
| 1:28:20| It's Jim Theusen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| I had a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5301)|
| 1:28:22| If this is going to be 11 to zero vote, maybe I could save my remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| What's your feeling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| Do you think it will be a – I mean, it's not close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| Why argue about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5310)|
| 1:28:31| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5311)|
| 1:28:32| We can't deliberate, so I have no idea what the vote will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| If you wouldn't mind giving us your address for the record, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| It's James Theusen, 633 Gulfwood Road, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5318)|
| 1:28:44| I wanted to attack it from sort of an international standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5324)|
| 1:28:49| If you don't like prayer at government meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5329)|
| 1:28:52| let's just see what happens if you eliminate religious altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5332)|
| 1:28:56| Two large countries did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| That would be East Germany and Russia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| who became one of the largest economic flops of the 20th century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| North Korea eliminated both prayer and religion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5346)|
| 1:29:09| and people there who have managed to escape have written books saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| North Korea is the most miserable country in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| There's no prayer any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Further, eastern Brazil has a region – I just discovered this in the last four or five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5358)|
| 1:29:23| with no schools, no libraries, and, of course, no churches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5363)|
| 1:29:29| On the map, they consider it an uncontested area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| There's lots of people there, but there is no civilization to amount to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5373)|
| 1:29:38| Prominent preachers, nonfiction book writers have written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5378)|
| 1:29:43| there is no civilization without good religion, good business, and a good government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| Rick Warren was one of the prominent ones that I like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| It's kind of a miracle to have a 12,000-member church out in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5392)|
| 1:29:57| It might be a miracle itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5397)|
| 1:29:59| This business about that we don't have any prayer at government doesn't sound ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| The U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, we got five Air Force through with the Coast Guard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5406)|
| 1:30:13| That's Army, Navy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5413)|
| 1:30:14| They all have chaplains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| They're paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| They have an equal number that are retired that worked at the $60,000, $70,000 limit their whole life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5417)|
| 1:30:24| and they pray all the time at government-owned facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| It's simply not true that there's no prayer at government meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5435)|
| 1:30:36| Our friends from Wisconsin can't sue them because to sue the federal government, they won't give permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5436)|
| 1:30:42| so they have been praying and will pray for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5442)|
| 1:30:48| Finally, there's the agreed non-Christian minorities, which are guys from Wisconsin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5448)|
| 1:30:52| seem to be offended by Christian or even non-denominational prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| The minority, of course, is asking the majority to change their procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| but, of course, they are not going to change their own procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| Why not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5464)|
| 1:31:05| Why can't we both be tolerant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| The Supreme Court has approved prayer before ballgames all kinds of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| Why not we just be a little bit more tolerant of each other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5471)|
| 1:31:17| The record for non-religious countries is horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| Next we have Reverend John Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5484)|
| 1:31:31| Sir, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| And if you would give us your address for the record, please, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Reverend John Gill, 1704 Winding Ridge Trail, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak, and thank you for your service in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| I wasn't expecting to be here until a short time ago when I heard about this issue, so I didn't dress appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| Bear with me on that, but I'm glad to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5512)|
| 1:31:55| I am a committed Christian and Christian pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5515)|
| 1:31:59| I've been a Christian pastor for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5519)|
| 1:32:01| I serve locally as senior pastor of Church of the Savior, United Church of Christ,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| and I've served in leadership positions in my denomination as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| Prayer is very important to me in my spiritual life, in my personal life, and, of course, as a local church pastor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5529)|
| 1:32:17| But I have to say I'm skeptical about the use of prayer to open public meetings and events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5537)|
| 1:32:24| From my personal perspective, for one thing, God is present with each one of us wherever we are at all times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5544)|
| 1:32:33| closer to us than our own breathing, as we say in my tradition, and opening a meeting with prayer or not will not change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5553)|
| 1:32:41| Secondly, even within the Christian scriptures, we are cautioned against public prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5561)|
| 1:32:48| and since we're going to bring religion into the civic area, I'd like to quote scripture and bring it all the way in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| But it says in Matthew 6, 5 to 6, Jesus said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the worship places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5579)|
| 1:33:06| and at the street corners so that they may be seen by others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| Truly, I tell you that they have received their reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| But whenever you pray, go into your room and pray to God who is in secret, and God who sees in secret will reward you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5592)|
| 1:33:21| So prayer to me is meant within our religious traditions for connecting to God, caring for our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5601)|
| 1:33:29| It's meant for healing. It's meant for seeking and finding the holy in our lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| And so we pray in our homes, in our houses of worship, and in our hearts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5612)|
| 1:33:37| But when we pray in a setting like this, dedicated to the service of a diverse community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5617)|
| 1:33:43| it seems to me that these purposes of prayer get distorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| The one thing that this issue has in common with the 287G issue is it's a mixture of purposes in my view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5627)|
| 1:33:54| What we do in our houses of worship and in our hearts and homes has a different purpose than what would happen in a prayer to open a meeting here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5634)|
| 1:34:02| Each of you represent, as you well know, not only the residents in your own neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5642)|
| 1:34:07| or the members of your own church or synagogue or mosque or wherever it is you worship or don't worship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5647)|
| 1:34:14| but you represent all people in the community of every faith and background in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5654)|
| 1:34:20| There is great diversity among Christians as well, as you know, diversity of theology and belief, diversity in styles of prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5660)|
| 1:34:29| The problem with prayer in a diverse setting like county commission is that each time a prayer is offered from a distinct tradition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5669)|
| 1:34:37| or from a representative of a distinct tradition in a setting like this, someone, even on the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5677)|
| 1:34:43| and certainly in the room and certainly in Knox County, someone will be subtly left out of that prayer's intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5683)|
| 1:34:52| Prayer will not be healing as it is meant to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| It will not connect but divide us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| And for that reason, I oppose the idea of opening, legislating to open these meetings with prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5699)|
| 1:35:07| If you're going to insist on opening them with prayer, I would hope you would follow the guidelines of a group like the National Conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| for Community and Justice, which was formerly the National Conference of Christians and Jews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| and they offer guidelines for nonsectarian interfaith prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| But in my opinion, that also kind of distorts the purposes of prayer within our own traditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| But I would recommend to you a practice that happens every month at the Knox County CAC board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5727)|
| 1:35:35| where our chairperson, Virginia Anagnost, opens the meeting with a call to a time of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| And she has a very beautiful statement that I haven't heard anywhere else that speaks about the purpose of the gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5741)|
| 1:35:48| and why we are there to serve and acknowledges the different traditions from which we come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| and then invites us into a time of silence, which we all end with a simple amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5753)|
| 1:35:59| But I find that moment to be very powerful and moving and centering and to have real purpose for our gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| without the kind of division that can happen if we start offering prayers from within distinct traditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5765)|
| 1:36:14| So talk to Virginia about that if you'd like, or we'll try to get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5774)|
| 1:36:19| But thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5779)|
| 1:36:21| And again, I would urge you not to institute this, not to legislate prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| I don't think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| And perhaps look for some other avenue for a moment of centering at the beginning of your meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5787)|
| 1:36:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5795)|
| 1:36:36| Lance McCold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5796)|
| 1:36:42| Sir, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5802)|
| 1:36:43| If you'll give us your address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5803)|
| 1:36:45| Yeah, Lance McCold, 130 Cogdell Road, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| I really don't need to say much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| Reverend Gil said everything I was going to say way better than I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| I would urge you to have a moment of silence to begin your meetings, and I think that would be wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5816)|
| 1:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5822)|
| 1:37:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5823)|
| 1:37:04| Reverend Jill Sizemore, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| And again, if you would give us your address, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5833)|
| 1:37:14| I am Reverend Jill Sizemore, senior pastor of Metropolitan Community Church in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| I live at 2227 Woodrow Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| And I would like to really thank and commend the commission for thinking of introducing an invocation resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5841)|
| 1:37:29| because it acknowledges that we as frail humans need to be led by a power greater than ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5849)|
| 1:37:37| We really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| And it's a novel idea that we stop and think of that and center in that for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5858)|
| 1:37:43| And the words from my brother, John Gil, I think paraphrase what I believe as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5863)|
| 1:37:49| that if we endorse any policy that doesn't write us, that writes us into a corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5869)|
| 1:37:54| we may very well recognize a God of only one color, a God of only one description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5874)|
| 1:38:00| and we may fail to recognize our diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5880)|
| 1:38:03| However, allowing the community to stand in a moment of reverent silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5883)|
| 1:38:08| does indeed focus for us what we have come here to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| and that is center ourselves as who we are in the God that we believe in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5892)|
| 1:38:18| to ask for guidance in that time that we are together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| to ask for goodwill, to ask for whatever we would ask for in that moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5902)|
| 1:38:27| to center ourselves to be for the good of our brothers and sisters in this area that we are called to lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| So I would just commend you again for bringing the resolution to point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| I would just ask that it's not something that we vote to legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5921)|
| 1:38:45| but something that we would honor in a moment of silence, as John Gil mentioned a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5925)|
| 1:38:52| because that will keep it again from being legislated and keep it nonpartisan, keep it nondistorted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5932)|
| 1:39:00| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| We appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| Dolly Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| We appreciate your being here with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5952)|
| 1:39:14| And if you would give us your address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| Thank you for having me today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5957)|
| 1:39:18| It's Polly Murphy, and it's 3111 Foster Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| And I'm coming to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| I'm a teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5967)|
| 1:39:28| I taught in a classroom for over 32 years in Knox County State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5968)|
| 1:39:35| And then I've also been working with early intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| so I also go to parents' homes now and work with babies in early intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5977)|
| 1:39:45| I guess I feel strongly that tolerance, openness, inclusiveness is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5985)|
| 1:39:55| It's not important to me if it's a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| It could be, which is inclusiveness to everybody, also for a moment of silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=5999)|
| 1:40:09| My feeling of teaching tolerance has been an important part of myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| and my teaching for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| And in looking at a classroom of children and talking about how important it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6017)|
| 1:40:23| I think that has grown and grown and grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| When I look at children, and they have been in our state for all those years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| I have taught Muslim children, I have taught Christian children, Jewish children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| children of Hindu faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| And when you look at them and then you talk about inclusiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| and you learn about what everybody else is learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| it's very hard to then stop and have a prayer and end it with in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6051)|
| 1:40:52| It's just hard to look up at the children that are not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| and explain what you're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| So I feel this is a very important, if it was important 40 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6061)|
| 1:41:06| acceptance, inclusiveness, and tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Now it's workshop after workshop for teachers in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| as far as people feeling you're speaking to them and their roots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| So I guess I would also end with, in growing up myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| I had moments of silence as well as prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| And while I was listening to other people speak, I was trying to remember back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6085)|
| 1:41:31| I think the moments of silence meant the most to me growing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| I think my mind didn't wander as much with a teacher who talked anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6095)|
| 1:41:39| who was talking in a prayer or reading the Bible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6099)|
| 1:41:42| which you tried to pay attention to when you were 9 or 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| But I think when it was put on myself that they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| this is what we're asking you to do now, and then it was really silent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| I feel like I paid more attention to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| But I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| Mr. Chairman, before she leaves the podium, I missed the street name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6120)|
| 1:42:08| Foster Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Foster Lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6132)|
| 1:42:13| Commissioner Brown, is that all of the, this is all that I have that have signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6133)|
| 1:42:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6139)|
| 1:42:20| I'd like to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| First off, the members of this commission voluntarily do the devotion each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6144)|
| 1:42:34| Each person has the opportunity to opt out if they do not want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6154)|
| 1:42:40| I don't see anyone up here promoting a specific religion other than they're leading in a prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6160)|
| 1:42:48| If that is offensive to anyone in the audience, they've got two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| They can leave or they can wait until after the devotion is over to come into the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6173)|
| 1:43:00| This is a commission meeting up here with 11 people representing the people of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6180)|
| 1:43:06| the majority of which reflect the views that each of us do sitting on this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6186)|
| 1:43:13| And we would be remiss if we did not go along with the majority of the constituents in our own districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6193)|
| 1:43:24| This country was founded on a belief in God based on godly principles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6204)|
| 1:43:32| That is carried down through the ages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6212)|
| 1:43:36| One person mentioned a while ago about being left out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| If we're praying to our God here, whichever one of us happens to be praying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| you have the freedom of religion to pray to your own God, whenever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| whoever you want at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| You don't have to pray to our God if you don't want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6233)|
| 1:43:56| But this is our choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| And I'll defend that right to do that until my dying day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Mike Hammond and I had a really good sunshine discussion about this last night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| and because I was unfortunately unable to be at the rules committee meeting when this was discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6256)|
| 1:44:26| and I have no objection to or I find it very helpful to have a moment to focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6266)|
| 1:44:38| and contemplate the work ahead of us as we get started every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| I think that's a very valuable thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| and I don't have any objection to putting that into writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| except that I would like to see this be inclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6292)|
| 1:45:01| and I don't think that the way it's written it's quite inclusive enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| We represent a wide diversity of people, every one of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6308)|
| 1:45:16| with a number of faith traditions and religions in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6316)|
| 1:45:23| And I think there are some other options that we can consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6323)|
| 1:45:33| one of which would be rather than having a commissioner each month be responsible for the devotional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6333)|
| 1:45:43| we could keep a database in the commission office of religious leaders in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6343)|
| 1:45:52| who would be willing to come and provide a devotional, and they could be selected on a rotating basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6352)|
| 1:46:00| So I could offer that as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| It's very important to me that people who ‑‑ that everyone who comes here to come before us with their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6363)|
| 1:46:14| feels that they are welcome and part of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6374)|
| 1:46:19| And I don't think that we are giving that currently with the way that we have been doing things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6379)|
| 1:46:32| And this policy and the way it's written basically just codifies what we've been doing up until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6392)|
| 1:46:39| So, again, I'm not opposed to taking a moment before we get started to pray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6399)|
| 1:46:46| or to have a devotional or to center ourselves or reflect on what we're about to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6406)|
| 1:46:54| But I would like something that encourages more inclusiveness than as it is currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6414)|
| 1:47:05| And, Mike, since you're the maker of this motion and this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6425)|
| 1:47:12| I was hoping for more of a dialogue as to anything that you would be open to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| any amendments that you would be willing to do with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6437)|
| 1:47:23| if you were open to anything along those lines or if you're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| I believe that the resolution as written is a good resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| Our conversation last night, we had talked about if any member of the faith-based community wanted to lead us in prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6451)|
| 1:47:38| that they could call the commission office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6458)|
| 1:47:40| I'm all in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| If anyone feels that they can come do that, I would welcome that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6461)|
| 1:47:46| Above and beyond that, I believe that the resolution is a good resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| I believe that it's constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| I believe that it puts into effect what we as a commission want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| It's a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| It can be changed at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6476)|
| 1:47:57| But I believe that this is the resolution that we have adopted to conduct our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6477)|
| 1:48:02| I do not believe that it excludes anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| I don't believe it proselytizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| I do not believe it enforces one religion over another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6486)|
| 1:48:10| I welcome members of the faith community to come and to lead us in prayer, regardless of what that faith may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6490)|
| 1:48:19| And so I don't have any issue with someone calling our office and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| we would like to be considered for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6502)|
| 1:48:24| But as far as us, this is a commission decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6504)|
| 1:48:29| And if the commissioners feel that they don't want to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| I certainly will abide by the wishes of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| My sense, though, is that they like the way that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6514)|
| 1:48:39| I believe that our law director has put together a resolution that is constitutional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6519)|
| 1:48:46| and meets the wishes of the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6526)|
| 1:48:51| I know that he's put together a resolution that's legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6531)|
| 1:48:56| As to whether or not it's in the best interest of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| and what we do, I think is a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6540)|
| 1:49:06| So would you be willing then to amend this to have a database kept by the commission office that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6546)|
| 1:49:14| rather than individual commissioners being responsible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6557)|
| 1:49:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| So because here's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| If you look back, and when I look back over the last four years that I've spent on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| the only time that there has not been a Protestant Christian prayer has been when it's been my turn to lead the devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6568)|
| 1:49:38| And I've been very sensitive to the other faith groups in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6578)|
| 1:49:48| and tried very hard to provide an alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| And so while this may not be written to be exclusively Christian-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6596)|
| 1:50:02| based on my experience up here for the last four years, this is what we're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6602)|
| 1:50:09| And I don't think that that's appropriate for this particular community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| We're an American community made up of tremendously diverse religious beliefs and practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6613)|
| 1:50:31| So if we're going to be acting as commissioners in this role,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| then this is an opportunity for us to tell everyone in our community that they are respected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| and that they are welcome to bring their business before us and that they are welcomed here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6639)|
| 1:50:45| and that they are not excluded from any part of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6645)|
| 1:50:50| And if we are indeed acting as individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| then it's an opportunity for my colleagues to tell me that they respect me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6653)|
| 1:51:02| So I cannot support this unless it is more inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6662)|
| 1:51:10| And, again, this speaks loud and clear to the members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6670)|
| 1:51:17| who would like to be recognized and respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6677)|
| 1:51:25| And also it says a lot to me about my place within this group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6691)|
| 1:51:33| You had somebody stepping up, but I want to go ahead and listen to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| And then I'll let you give us your name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| My name is Roberta Potter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| I live at 4604 Crosby Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| I just wanted to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| I think we all do respect each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| But I do want to say that Knox County is historically a Christian community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| And when in the late 1700s our founder came here, James White,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6719)|
| 1:52:05| and he built his log cabin here on the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| one of his first acts was to dedicate his turnip patch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| and his land for a cemetery and a place to worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6732)|
| 1:52:19| So Mr. White, at that time he was an elder in the Lebanon and the Forks Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| which is up at the forks of the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| His pastor was Samuel Carrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| So he asked Pastor Carrick, would you come down and preach for us just a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| just a few of them, his family and several other families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| And he preached for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| And then later Pastor Carrick left that pastorate there at Lebanon and the Forks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| and came down to Knoxville, or what was going to become Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6761)|
| 1:52:47| and led that fledgling flock there that later became First Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6767)|
| 1:52:53| And after he pastored there for many years, he also started a Christian school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| which most of you know later became the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6779)|
| 1:53:04| This is our heritage, and it's not to be in the face of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6784)|
| 1:53:09| But our heritage here in Knox County is a Christian heritage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| and for which we are indeed thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| Our founder, James White, continued as founding elder of First Presbyterian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6796)|
| 1:53:21| Now, he was our founder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6801)|
| 1:53:22| He was the elder there at First Presbyterian Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| He strongly supported Carrick's efforts in Christian education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6806)|
| 1:53:31| Our founder, Mr. White, and our spiritual father, Samuel Carrick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| dedicated their lives to seeing that this small community that became Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| was rooted in biblical principles and strong Judeo-Christian ethic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6821)|
| 1:53:46| And today we are reaping the benefit of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| And I think every one of us here are thankful and glad that we live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6835)|
| 1:53:56| I'm so thankful to be a citizen here, and my ancestors were here before we became a state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6836)|
| 1:54:03| So today I think that what the chair and most of the commissioners have said is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6843)|
| 1:54:13| According to our history, that we continue to be and to build upon what they started so long ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6853)|
| 1:54:21| where people want to live and want to move here and to live and bring up their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6861)|
| 1:54:27| Of course, all beliefs are welcome, but our history and our roots are Judeo-Christian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6867)|
| 1:54:33| of which we're proud and thankful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6873)|
| 1:54:35| So God bless all of you for wanting to serve our county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6875)|
| 1:54:39| and may our Heavenly Father continue to smile upon Knox County and East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6879)|
| 1:54:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6889)|
| 1:54:51| I just want to remind us as commissioners, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6891)|
| 1:54:54| none of us just walked into this seat and flopped down and sat down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| We knocked on thousands and thousands of doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6898)|
| 1:55:02| And that's how we get the pulse of what the community is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| and that's how the community gets the pulse of what we are as men and women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| They know what we stand for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6912)|
| 1:55:14| They know what our beliefs are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| They ask us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| We go through so many debates that we have out there on the campaign trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| So I think the community knows what they're getting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| Mr. Chairman, I appreciate what you're saying on how we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| I'm looking at if there's 11 of us and we do this, then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| if there's 11 Christians or 11 atheists, whatever they are, that's what it's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| But the people put us up here, as Commissioner Brown said, they elected us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| They know what we stand for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| And occasionally we'll get prayers from this type and that type, and that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6948)|
| 1:55:52| We'll listen to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| But it's, you know, the majority is what the majority is with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| I got also this morning, Commissioner McKenzie, I'm going to pass this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| I've got a church in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| He happens to live in my district, the Macedonian United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| They had 46 signatures that they were all for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| So I wanted to pass that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| He just hand-delivered that to me, so I'll pass that on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| We'll pass that on to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| But I'm thinking some people are misunderstanding really what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6978)|
| 1:56:22| And I'd like to ask the Law Director if he would just go through and explain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| because I think we're making more out of this than what it really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| So, Mr. Law Director, because you did a good job with that in the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6990)|
| 1:56:33| can you just sort of go over that real quick, and then I'll have some other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| As a member of the Commission, I think, like any kind of controversial issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| emotionally charged issue, there's a lot of disinformation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| First of all, this policy is not something we got too inventive with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7007)|
| 1:56:51| What we did was reduce to writing that's what you've been doing for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| And I think there's a lot of disinformation in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| that people are saying, oh, they're going to start praying now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| You've been praying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| So the bottom line is what this does is commit to writing that which you've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7022)|
| 1:57:07| because if your policies are ever challenged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| courts do prefer to see a written, cogent, uniformly enforced, and followed policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| That's all this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7035)|
| 1:57:16| But, again, it is your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7036)|
| 1:57:19| You can certainly do different iterations of that policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| But the way it stands now, you have 11 commissioners on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| You have the opportunity to either pray in your own faith or, on the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7045)|
| 1:57:30| ask a third party to pray in your stead and be that any member of the community, religious or otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7050)|
| 1:57:38| So that's what this does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| And I believe, in the current state of the law, it is an enforceable policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| But, again, it's your policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7065)|
| 1:57:47| You can determine you don't want to pray whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| Just stop praying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7070)|
| 1:57:51| Or, on the alternative, you can say we're going to pray, but the 11 commissioners are not going to pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7071)|
| 1:57:56| Or you can continue doing that which you've done over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7076)|
| 1:58:00| But that's your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| And that's all this policy does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| So it doesn't get any more far afield beyond that which you've already done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| And it is an inclusive policy, because in the past you have permitted a multitude of faiths to come before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7088)|
| 1:58:14| And they, from my understanding, are equally as welcome today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7094)|
| 1:58:19| You know, Mr. Chairman, I go back to our campaign days when we were out there knocking on doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| and the people weren't home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7103)|
| 1:58:24| We left our push cards with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7104)|
| 1:58:26| And I dare to say that most everybody here as commissioner listed their church affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7106)|
| 1:58:31| Most people said, you know, I belong to such and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| You know, I belong to the United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7114)|
| 1:58:35| I'm proud of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7115)|
| 1:58:36| I put that on my push card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7116)|
| 1:58:37| I'm an active member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| If you don't believe in that and that offends you, then you don't need to vote for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| The majority of the people seem to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7123)|
| 1:58:45| So, you know, Mr. Chairman, I like your resolution here, what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7131)|
| 1:58:53| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| I'd like to take a little issue of what Commissioner Brewer said a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| inferring that us praying has a negative influence on any issue that people bring before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7141)|
| 1:59:10| I think that's a total asinine statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| The issues that we have before us, we're asking for guidance, each of us in our own way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7154)|
| 1:59:22| Each one prays to their own God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| God is inside here in each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| You pray to him because you want guidance and wisdom in making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7167)|
| 1:59:33| I do not believe that anybody has suffered coming before us because we pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7173)|
| 1:59:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| I appreciate this discussion, many parts of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| not the least of which was James White dedicating his tournament patch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7194)|
| 2:00:01| I really like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7201)|
| 2:00:03| But obviously it's a sensitive issue and it's an important issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7203)|
| 2:00:10| and I'm in agreement with the policy that we have and what's going to be promoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7210)|
| 2:00:17| But at the same time, I'm very sensitive, and the discussion has re-sensitized me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7217)|
| 2:00:23| I mean, I'm always sensitive when I pray, and I don't, when I pray before this body or for this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| it's not a, I mean, it's certainly one of those times where I wrestle with what to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| and how to say it and how to say it in a way that is inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7237)|
| 2:00:41| And so that's sometimes hard for those of us that are Christians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7241)|
| 2:00:46| It's real hard not to say, you know, in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7246)|
| 2:00:50| It really is because we're so convicted of that, and we've experienced, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7250)|
| 2:00:58| we've had that touch or whatever that we almost, it's like a denial of the fact that you're a Christian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7258)|
| 2:01:06| if you don't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7266)|
| 2:01:08| So it's a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7268)|
| 2:01:10| It is a difficult thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7270)|
| 2:01:12| But simultaneously, you know, I hear Amy, and I respect Amy, and I respect her position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7272)|
| 2:01:22| and her, you know, her sensitivity, her inclusiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| And certainly I'll try to, when it comes my time again, I'll try to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7288)|
| 2:01:35| And I think that's an important aspect of this for our group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7295)|
| 2:01:43| The only other thing that I'd say is, you know, it's something that, and I thought Mr. Gill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7303)|
| 2:01:50| Pastor Gill, his expression is very well taken, and certainly something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7310)|
| 2:01:57| a preceding remark and a moment of silence and something that was well done for this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7317)|
| 2:02:04| would probably just, you know, it would be a very good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7328)|
| 2:02:10| But I certainly think that prayer is a moral discipline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7330)|
| 2:02:16| It's like going to the gym.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| And it certainly is for me, and I think it's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7338)|
| 2:02:27| I think it's a good thing for this body to show that it begins meetings with prayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7347)|
| 2:02:34| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I think it's good for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| I, like Commissioner Norman, am going to support this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7366)|
| 2:02:54| But unlike him, you know, the lady's statement about James White| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7374)|
| 2:03:02| and pastor up at Forks of the River, you know, kind of made me think a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7382)|
| 2:03:09| Because the reality of it is, when they were talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7389)|
| 2:03:14| they weren't talking about me as an African American, me as a black man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| I wasn't included in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7397)|
| 2:03:19| And that's history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7399)|
| 2:03:21| And I do appreciate the history lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7401)|
| 2:03:24| I love history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| I love the history of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| But that's not one of the aspects that I take pride in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| So what am I saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7409)|
| 2:03:31| I'm saying that things do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7411)|
| 2:03:33| I'm saying that I'd stake, you know, half a dollar on the fact that I probably work harder in my church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7413)|
| 2:03:45| than probably most of these commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| I mean, I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7427)|
| 2:03:49| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7429)|
| 2:03:51| Now Governor Haslam said, does this place open up without you when he was mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7431)|
| 2:03:56| I mean, I work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| I love my church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| I love the Lord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7439)|
| 2:04:01| But when I look at this and I hear Commissioner Smith say, you know, most of my people are Christian, he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7441)|
| 2:04:12| But if it's two out of ten or one out of eleven, what about that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7452)|
| 2:04:18| There's that minority people report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7458)|
| 2:04:22| And we do have to represent all of our districts, like it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7462)|
| 2:04:27| I represent the entire 1st District, as do you, with two commissioners representing the entirety of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7467)|
| 2:04:34| And so what am I saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7474)|
| 2:04:37| We need to be sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7477)|
| 2:04:38| Commissioner Norman is absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| It's hard not to put that on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7481)|
| 2:04:43| But that is offensive to a lot of people when we say in Jesus' name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7483)|
| 2:04:48| It's offensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7488)|
| 2:04:49| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7489)|
| 2:04:51| So, but, you know, if biblically, we can't defend this biblically, this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7491)|
| 2:04:58| I mean, the pastor's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| I mean, Matthew, he says those are Jesus' words, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| If that's all we're about is getting this devotion and saying it out loud, that's what our reward is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| We're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| He's not going to lay another blessing upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| Okay, so that's the reality of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7513)|
| 2:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Again, I support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| But if the only reason we're doing this is to say this is what I want to do, and we're going to say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| and you're going to listen, that's not what Jesus would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| That is not his teaching, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7528)|
| 2:05:31| So what am I saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7531)|
| 2:05:34| What am I asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| Going forward, let's all, I'm guilty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7536)|
| 2:05:39| I'm guilty of being insensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7539)|
| 2:05:47| If I don't say at the end of my prayer, and I will be praying in Jesus' name, does that mean I love Jesus less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7547)|
| 2:05:56| No, it doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7556)|
| 2:05:57| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7557)|
| 2:05:58| It does not mean that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7558)|
| 2:05:59| It means that I'm going to open this meeting with, hopefully, with his blessings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7559)|
| 2:06:11| with God's anointment over this meeting, and I'm acknowledging him in all ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| In all ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| Okay, so, again, I am going to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| I do support this, and I do commend both, not only Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7581)|
| 2:06:26| He had the easy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| The law director and his staff had the much more difficult task of crafting words that are defensible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7588)|
| 2:06:35| and I think we're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| We discussed it a lot in the Rules Committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| I think we're there, and that's really what I'm concerned with, because the lawsuits are going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7599)|
| 2:06:43| They're going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7603)|
| 2:06:45| But I do think that we're standing on some pretty solid ground, so thank you for that, and I'll pass, turn my light off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7605)|
| 2:06:54| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7614)|
| 2:06:56| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| Commissioner McKenzie, I'm proud to follow you and what you had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7618)|
| 2:07:03| because I believe that's now turning the conversation in the direction that we're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7623)|
| 2:07:10| setting here as the legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7630)|
| 2:07:13| We can go out in our community and work hard in faith or at our faith, but that's in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7633)|
| 2:07:31| I've kind of got to elbow my compatriot on my right side here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7651)|
| 2:07:39| The relatively conservative 8th District has lots of people in it, and I have to represent them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7659)|
| 2:07:50| And you've heard me say that before here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7670)|
| 2:07:52| That's the reason I'm here is to represent all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7672)|
| 2:07:57| This is not a question about the Bible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7677)|
| 2:08:05| I hesitate to say this next sentence, and that we have had admonitions from the speakers here this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7685)|
| 2:08:19| telling us what to do religiously, and that's the very thing that I want to wander away from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7699)|
| 2:08:25| I want to be away from trying to say to someone biblically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| or in other religious documents about how I should work or how other people should treat me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7711)|
| 2:08:45| I look at the resolutions before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| Thank you, Mr. Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7728)|
| 2:08:49| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| I do not find the word prayer in this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7731)|
| 2:08:57| We're talking about formalizing how we take up our meeting, and we're using the word invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7737)|
| 2:09:05| Now, some people may not find a difference or a variance between those two words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| but I somehow do because it was kind of important to me the first time I delivered the invocation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7751)|
| 2:09:24| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| Someone gets on me for saying I'm a poor country farm boy in here from Corrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| I believe it's Phil Ballard that says that's probably not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7770)|
| 2:09:33| But I stood at the podium and had a short story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7773)|
| 2:09:40| and I may have used the word amen at the end of the first time I did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7780)|
| 2:09:45| but the second time I stood at the podium and brought what I would call the invocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7785)|
| 2:09:50| and admonishing us to do right and to take some allegory or some whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7790)|
| 2:09:58| and say help your brother that may have fallen in a ditch over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7798)|
| 2:10:03| rather than walking on the other side of the road, I did not use the word amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| I did that purposefully because I was standing there as a private citizen of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7809)|
| 2:10:18| trying to do the best I could at not using those short names like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7818)|
| 2:10:30| and you remember those short names of those that used to be here with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7830)|
| 2:10:40| And I've got three or four other points here that really just continue the thought about where we are today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7840)|
| 2:10:48| and what we're trying to do today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7848)|
| 2:10:50| and that's how do we get our meeting off on a positive foot of trying to say to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7850)|
| 2:10:58| I'm here to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| We can't do that in silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7861)|
| 2:11:03| It takes words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7863)|
| 2:11:07| We are limiting ourselves by not doing it to any religious following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7867)|
| 2:11:14| Read the sentences there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| We're going to be under some strict how do we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7876)|
| 2:11:25| And having said all that, I appreciate those that have brought it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| I appreciate all the people that have taken enough focus and interest to be here this afternoon to tell us how you feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7890)|
| 2:11:40| That's the reason we have it in the big room, as I refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| We meet in this big room so there's plenty of space out there for people to bring their ideas and opinions to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7903)|
| 2:11:50| We can't please everyone, but we can be in the middle of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7910)|
| 2:11:55| and I support this resolution as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| Before I get to Commissioner Burrell, sir, you're at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| We want to give you an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| If you could give us your name and address for the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7927)|
| 2:12:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7928)|
| 2:12:09| Hi, I'm Todd Shelton, and I live out in South Knox County, 3111 Foster Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7929)|
| 2:12:17| Mike, I'm in your district, and I voted for you, but it had nothing to do with your religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7937)|
| 2:12:25| I've never voted for anybody in this country, and I've been voting since I was old enough to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7945)|
| 2:12:31| I've never voted because of their religion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| I was raised a Christian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7954)|
| 2:12:38| I do change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7958)|
| 2:12:41| The recognition of at least 30% of the population in our area here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7961)|
| 2:12:48| that have some other religion besides being a Protestant Christian is a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7968)|
| 2:12:57| I would never want any of you to leave your religion at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7977)|
| 2:13:02| but I really don't want to hear about your religion up here at this podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7982)|
| 2:13:08| You all represent a real source of power here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7988)|
| 2:13:13| so how you present yourself and introduce yourself sends a message out to what is going to be included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=7993)|
| 2:13:22| And that's not anybody's fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8002)|
| 2:13:24| That's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8004)|
| 2:13:26| It has to do the same thing happens with race and gender, same problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8006)|
| 2:13:32| So, you know, I want people to take a breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8012)|
| 2:13:38| There's been a wonderful alternative suggested here that's been done other places in our county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8018)|
| 2:13:44| And don't be afraid of losing your faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8024)|
| 2:13:49| God's bigger than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8029)|
| 2:13:52| Just make yourself open to other people's faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8032)|
| 2:13:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8037)|
| 2:13:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8038)|
| 2:13:59| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8039)|
| 2:14:03| Yes, sir, you want to make another remark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8043)|
| 2:14:05| Larry Rhodes again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8045)|
| 2:14:06| I left out a page of my address because of time limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8046)|
| 2:14:11| I would like to read that if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8051)|
| 2:14:13| It just addresses a couple of more points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8056)|
| 2:14:18| You are on the brink of creating a new precedent that the consensus of the commissioner's religion should be represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8058)|
| 2:14:30| to the general public in this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| If I didn't sum that up right, please let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8074)|
| 2:14:38| No, because there could be 11 Muslims up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| It's still going to the same resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8081)|
| 2:14:43| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8083)|
| 2:14:44| You're creating a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| I'd like to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| What we're doing is we're not establishing a precedent of pushing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8090)|
| 2:14:56| or condoning the religious beliefs of any commissioner up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8096)|
| 2:15:01| What we're doing is setting a policy for doing something we've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8101)|
| 2:15:06| And it is not, there's nothing in there about establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8106)|
| 2:15:10| or proselytizing any religion or any view of any commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8110)|
| 2:15:15| The commissioner has the obligation or the opportunity to invite whoever they want to do that devotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| There is nothing to say that it has to be religious in nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8121)|
| 2:15:24| I've not read the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8124)|
| 2:15:26| I really can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8126)|
| 2:15:27| Then I wouldn't comment on what the intent of the resolution is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8129)|
| 2:15:30| I would like to comment on what I've heard here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8130)|
| 2:15:33| This lady here said that she doesn't see much representation of other religions in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8133)|
| 2:15:39| This man over here said that the commission, the consensus of the religions of the commission ought to hold sway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8139)|
| 2:15:48| And that's what I'm addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8148)|
| 2:15:50| Secondly, you should be very concerned about this because the religion of Islam is the fastest growing religion in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8150)|
| 2:15:58| You're creating, basically, a hole for another religion to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| Secondly, the separation of church and state from the very beginning of this country was not the wish so much of the founding fathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8163)|
| 2:16:13| as it was the original churches that were in the founding states of America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8173)|
| 2:16:20| They were very concerned that the Anglican Church would get into the Constitution, get into the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| and that all the other religions of the country would be outlawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8188)|
| 2:16:34| That is why we have separation of church and state in America, because of the early churches, not the founding fathers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8194)|
| 2:16:41| They didn't want any particular church in the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8201)|
| 2:16:46| And that's what you're doing here, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8206)|
| 2:16:47| If you bring the sectarian prayer in, you're saying Protestant religions is the religion of the government of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8207)|
| 2:16:57| Now, you may not be using the word Jesus in your resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8217)|
| 2:17:00| You may not be using Christianity per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8220)|
| 2:17:04| But speaking as an atheist who represents 400 other atheists, and I could bring their names in as well and hand it to the group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8224)|
| 2:17:15| I don't feel represented by Christian prayer or any prayer personally in this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8235)|
| 2:17:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8244)|
| 2:17:25| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8245)|
| 2:17:27| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8248)|
| 2:17:29| Your light wasn't on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8249)|
| 2:17:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8250)|
| 2:17:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| I had turned it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| But I'm sorry you misunderstood what I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8254)|
| 2:17:41| And, again, I'm not objecting to prayer before meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8261)|
| 2:17:45| I hope you all understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8265)|
| 2:17:49| What I have been asking for is an inclusive policy, a mechanism that provides for more than just one point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8269)|
| 2:18:01| which is what we've got up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8281)|
| 2:18:03| It's what we've had for the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8283)|
| 2:18:07| That's all that I have been asking for, and I appreciate Tony's sensitivity on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8287)|
| 2:18:16| And, as a matter of fact, because I have gone out of my way to go beyond my own religious tradition, which most of you know that I grew up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8296)|
| 2:18:27| believe it or not, I grew up wanting to be a Catholic nun and have grown up in the Methodist church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8307)|
| 2:18:38| and the Catholic church and attend the Unitarian Universalist church and get tremendous joy from my faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8318)|
| 2:18:46| and from experiencing the diverse faiths of the people around me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8326)|
| 2:18:55| But because I've gone out of my way to bring other points of view in when the devotional has been my responsibility, I have had citizens come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8335)|
| 2:19:05| and say, thank you for doing something other than the standard Christian prayer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| because I don't feel comfortable that that's all I hear every month at commission meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8350)|
| 2:19:17| And if you've never been in a minority group, you may not understand what that feels like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8357)|
| 2:19:25| and probably none of you sitting up here have never had the experience of being in a minority group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8365)|
| 2:19:32| So that's not a feeling that you're familiar with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| But there are a number of people who do feel excluded month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8376)|
| 2:19:50| And, again, I'm not asking that we don't have a devotional, that we don't have an invocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8390)|
| 2:19:57| All I have been asking for is a policy that allows and goes beyond allowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8397)|
| 2:20:05| but that provides for more inclusiveness than what we've had here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8405)|
| 2:20:14| That's all that I have asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8417)|
| 2:20:20| Just to reiterate to you that we're very sensitive to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8420)|
| 2:20:29| I look at it, we're a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8429)|
| 2:20:31| We walk out of here, somebody's in trouble, you're in trouble, we're going to cover your back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8431)|
| 2:20:36| You know, I feel that we love each other here, and there's different beliefs and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8436)|
| 2:20:40| but I think we're all very sensitive to everybody's beliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8440)|
| 2:20:45| You know, I don't take that for granted in any way whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8445)|
| 2:20:50| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8450)|
| 2:20:53| I'm sorry, Larry, but you're not sitting in my seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8453)|
| 2:20:57| And it's different over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8457)|
| 2:20:59| I mean, I've been in a minority a whole lot of times myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8459)|
| 2:21:05| All for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8465)|
| 2:21:06| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8469)|
| 2:21:10| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| Me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| Ten in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8476)|
| 2:21:17| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8477)|
| 2:21:18| Group hug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8478)|
| 2:21:20| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8480)|
| 2:21:21| On page 10, Resolution 905,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8485)|
| 2:21:28| amending the Knox County Commission rules to change the meeting time of the zoning portion of the Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8488)|
| 2:21:33| regular monthly agenda to 5 o'clock p.m. or soon thereafter, effective September 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8493)|
| 2:21:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8500)|
| 2:21:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8501)|
| 2:21:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8502)|
| 2:21:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8503)|
| 2:21:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8504)|
| 2:21:45| Commissioner Wright and then Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8505)|
| 2:21:47| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8507)|
| 2:21:48| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| I did not attend the rules committee meeting the other day, but I wasn't invited because I'm not a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8510)|
| 2:21:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8517)|
| 2:22:00| Someone hit no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8520)|
| 2:22:01| I just could not make that meeting that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8521)|
| 2:22:03| So my opinion is still the same as I would have explained it the last time we looked at how we changed our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8523)|
| 2:22:11| what times do we meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8531)|
| 2:22:14| I'm torn with this moving the zoning off of 6 o'clock to 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8534)|
| 2:22:22| If we have time to move something, I'll look at the other end of the schedule being more important to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8542)|
| 2:22:28| in that we begin at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8548)|
| 2:22:31| Maybe we need to begin at noon with Chairman's lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8551)|
| 2:22:35| Maybe we need to move beer board to 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| Or we need to take time at the other end because right now it's 4 o'clock, and we're going to, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8559)|
| 2:22:48| have a little break here before the 5 o'clock hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| But maybe if we took things that were earlier in the day and move them off for those, and it's not me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8572)|
| 2:23:01| I don't have a full-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8581)|
| 2:23:03| It's Larry here that has to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8583)|
| 2:23:06| No, it's the opportunity for us to have a larger lunch or the beer board not meet at 1 o'clock immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8586)|
| 2:23:16| after maybe pushing those people that come before us at 1 o'clock for beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8596)|
| 2:23:24| I see two things that are taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8604)|
| 2:23:26| One, we have the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8606)|
| 2:23:27| We could move things later in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| And the other is that we're moving things that occur at 6 up in the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8610)|
| 2:23:36| when making time for people to attend zoning is where I focus that we maybe should stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8616)|
| 2:23:44| That's my only comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8624)|
| 2:23:46| This is the only rules changes in this paragraph, right, or that we're changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8626)|
| 2:23:50| It's just we're not doing other rule changes, are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| Yes, and it would be effective in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8636)|
| 2:23:57| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8637)|
| 2:23:58| Just questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8638)|
| 2:24:00| The discussion, Commissioner Anderson-Brown brought it, and so I was just wondering about the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8640)|
| 2:24:08| I wasn't there either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8648)|
| 2:24:10| Was there a majority wants to move it to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8650)|
| 2:24:15| I just wanted to hear how it went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| We didn't really have a discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8656)|
| 2:24:18| We just, you know, it's the last several months we've been through by four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8658)|
| 2:24:23| and you've got to sit around or go home and come back at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| And we figured that most of the time it would be just as easy for folks to get here at 5 as it would be 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8666)|
| 2:24:32| So why not go ahead and move that up to 5 o'clock and, you know, go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8672)|
| 2:24:37| That was the only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8677)|
| 2:24:38| We haven't really had any real discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8678)|
| 2:24:40| It was just put on the table as far as, you know, if it becomes an issue, we can move it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8680)|
| 2:24:44| But it's we've had a lot of dead time between those two meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| and I think that that was what brought it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8687)|
| 2:24:50| But the Rules Committee was unanimous on recommending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8693)|
| 2:24:54| And I don't have any problem with it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| You know, when we get some issue that's really, really large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8697)|
| 2:25:02| would we have the option to move it back to or amend the meeting time for that particular meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8702)|
| 2:25:09| The meeting says 5 or thereafter, whenever the chairman ceases commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8709)|
| 2:25:15| And so we can, if there's a big issue that's a zoning issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8715)|
| 2:25:21| delay them until 5, 30 or 6 o'clock until folks can get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| Because we're liable to have an issue that has 400 people here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8726)|
| 2:25:29| Well, we can do like we used to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8729)|
| 2:25:31| We stop and have the zoning and go back to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8734)|
| 2:25:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8735)|
| 2:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8736)|
| 2:25:37| Whatever is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8737)|
| 2:25:38| But, I mean, I think this streamlines it a little better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8738)|
| 2:25:41| Mr. Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8741)|
| 2:25:42| Yes, we are becoming remarkably efficient in our meetings, which I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8742)|
| 2:25:48| So would it be possible to also move commission maybe to 3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8748)|
| 2:25:55| Because we have had a couple of hours, normally a couple hours in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8755)|
| 2:26:00| And that way they would be – because it seems like most of the people who are here for regular commission meetings are staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8760)|
| 2:26:08| county staff, and the people who are here for zonings are citizens who have an issue to bring before the zonings board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8768)|
| 2:26:16| So it makes sense to have starter commissions during the work – or start a commission meeting during the work day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8776)|
| 2:26:23| and do zonings in the evening after people get off from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8783)|
| 2:26:27| But I'm just wondering if we can't compress it even a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| I'm of the opinion that the lunch has been very effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| And so moving commission two hours from lunch would be nonproductive, dead time also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8795)|
| 2:26:40| Well, also, you're talking about moving commission meeting to 3 o'clock when staff people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8800)|
| 2:26:47| we don't necessarily always get through in an hour or so before they're going home time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8807)|
| 2:26:51| So this gives us at least a couple hours to work with staff people without holding them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8811)|
| 2:26:56| So since Mike talks without turning his light on, I'm going to do it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| Staff people are salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8821)|
| 2:27:02| I'm really tired of folks worrying about staff people staying over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| They're not nine to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8828)|
| 2:27:09| They're not paid nine to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8829)|
| 2:27:10| We need to quit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8830)|
| 2:27:11| I mean, if we want them here, they need to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8831)|
| 2:27:14| I mean, this is their job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| Same with my job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8836)|
| 2:27:18| I mean, that's just the way when you're compensated at the professional level, that's what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| You have late nights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8843)|
| 2:27:26| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8846)|
| 2:27:28| It's been so long I've almost forgot what I wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8848)|
| 2:27:34| But Commissioner Wright's giving me signals over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8854)|
| 2:27:37| No, what I was going to say about this is that sometimes what we can do, even if we start,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| and I am in favor of starting at 5 o'clock and we can see how it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| I don't want to exclude anyone that wants to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| And I can really appreciate people that have to take off from work to come down here to witness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8867)|
| 2:27:53| or give opinions on county business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| But we could adjust the agenda on the zonings to do the non-controversial business first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8875)|
| 2:28:03| And usually by the time we do that, it's a quarter after five or 20 after five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8883)|
| 2:28:09| There's a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8889)|
| 2:28:11| Frequently we'll have the people who are the proponents for it to do it first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8891)|
| 2:28:16| and they absolutely have an interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8896)|
| 2:28:18| Usually it's actually the attorneys who are doing that, and they are being paid to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8898)|
| 2:28:23| and I'm sure they appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| And so we're really running almost into 5.30 or later by the time the controversial issues come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8905)|
| 2:28:32| So people, I think, do have a chance to be down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8912)|
| 2:28:35| If it's something that we need to delay, we could take a recess to 5.30 or 20 until 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8915)|
| 2:28:43| if we happen to go through those things early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8923)|
| 2:28:45| But there's a lot of times, you know, we can go through these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| and it's not going to exclude the public from being heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8928)|
| 2:28:54| I mean, we could do a 20-minute recess if we get through the non-essential business first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8934)|
| 2:29:01| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8941)|
| 2:29:02| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8942)|
| 2:29:04| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8944)|
| 2:29:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8946)|
| 2:29:07| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8947)|
| 2:29:08| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8948)|
| 2:29:10| Just one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8950)|
| 2:29:11| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8951)|
| 2:29:13| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| It just wants to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8964)|
| 2:29:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8966)|
| 2:29:35| We have discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8975)|
| 2:29:37| We have first discussion items is regarding 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8977)|
| 2:29:41| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8981)|
| 2:29:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8982)|
| 2:29:43| Can we have a recess, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8983)|
| 2:29:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8984)|
| 2:29:45| Let's come back at 4.15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8985)|
| 2:29:46| That gives us 10 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| So we'll come back and I think we have two to three discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=8987)|
| 2:30:12| It's 4.17, so let's go back into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9012)|
| 2:30:14| We have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9014)|
| 2:30:16| Commissioner Burroughs, how would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9018)|
| 2:30:20| I put this on the agenda because I have been getting some phone calls about 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9020)|
| 2:30:27| I've met with Sheriff Jones about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| I think it's important to note that he has not entered into any agreement with immigration and customs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9031)|
| 2:30:42| This is just a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9042)|
| 2:30:45| He doesn't even have what the MOU would be yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9045)|
| 2:30:50| And when he does get that and the law department goes over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9050)|
| 2:30:57| and if they decide to move forward, there will be public meetings, question and answer times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9057)|
| 2:31:05| But there are a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9065)|
| 2:31:08| There is a lot of misinformation and a lot of confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9068)|
| 2:31:16| So all I was trying to do is create a space where people who have concerns can come and share them and be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9076)|
| 2:31:27| and where hopefully we can dispel some of the incorrect information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9087)|
| 2:31:36| and really just provide a place where some communication can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9096)|
| 2:31:43| And I know that there are a number of people who are here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9103)|
| 2:31:48| and I have heard their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9108)|
| 2:31:54| I've also had several conversations with Sheriff Jones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9114)|
| 2:31:59| and I feel really comfortable moving forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9119)|
| 2:32:07| So I just wanted to thank everyone for coming today and sharing their thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9127)|
| 2:32:13| We have five people who have signed up to speak, and so you will have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9133)|
| 2:32:19| when you come to the podium, if you give us your name and address of the record, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9139)|
| 2:32:22| We'll begin with Dwayne Crager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9142)|
| 2:32:28| Thank you, sir, for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9148)|
| 2:32:29| And, again, if you'd give us your address, then you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9149)|
| 2:32:32| Yeah, my name is Dwayne Crager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9152)|
| 2:32:33| I live at 11631 Lanesboro Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9153)|
| 2:32:37| and I thank you for allowing me to speak about the ramifications of a memo of agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9157)|
| 2:32:44| that ICE is offering to the Knox County Sheriff's Department for signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9164)|
| 2:32:49| First, a word about the exhibits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9169)|
| 2:32:52| The first exhibit shows you the sources of the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| One of our exhibits is missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9177)|
| 2:32:59| We can't project it on the screen, so we only have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9179)|
| 2:33:02| It shows you the other exhibits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9182)|
| 2:33:06| and instructions of how you can get copies of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| Each document is readily available on the ICE website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9190)|
| 2:33:15| The second exhibit, which you have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9195)|
| 2:33:19| is the standard ICE memo of agreement as revised in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9199)|
| 2:33:26| Now, there's another piece of paper, and that is the copy of this report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9206)|
| 2:33:30| in case I can't say it all in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9210)|
| 2:33:37| The purpose of this MOA is that it sets forth the terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| pursuant to which selected KCSO personnel will be nominated, trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9223)|
| 2:33:49| and approved by ICE to perform certain functions, immigration functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9229)|
| 2:33:55| as an immigration officer within KCSO's area of responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9235)|
| 2:34:01| My colleagues will address other issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9241)|
| 2:34:03| but I will concentrate on those issues, terms and conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9243)|
| 2:34:07| that will incur additional KCSO expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9247)|
| 2:34:13| and or add more work to KCSO's already busy workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9253)|
| 2:34:20| Here is what ICE asks of KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| KCSO will agree that individuals who successfully complete the training under this MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9264)|
| 2:34:31| will perform immigration functions for a minimum of two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9271)|
| 2:34:36| KCSO will be responsible for all salaries, overtime, travel expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9276)|
| 2:34:42| housing and per diem for the trainees, as well as the salaries and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9282)|
| 2:34:47| of all persons performing the regular work of their trainees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9287)|
| 2:34:52| not only while in training, but later as they're performing ICE immigration services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9292)|
| 2:35:00| This could mean providing backup personnel for each successful candidate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9300)|
| 2:35:07| for up to two years and four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9307)|
| 2:35:11| If equipment is installed, KCSO will provide for the necessary cabling and power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9311)|
| 2:35:19| as well as security to ensure this equipment will be used by certified ICE personnel only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9319)|
| 2:35:28| If ICE deems it necessary, KCSO will enter into an intergovernmental service agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9328)|
| 2:35:35| to provide instructions and guidelines for the housing and transportation of detainees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9335)|
| 2:35:42| KCSO personnel will provide for interpreters for subjects with limited English| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9342)|
| 2:35:48| and will provide a list of available qualified interpreters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9348)|
| 2:35:53| Now, in addition to those conditions that I have mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9353)|
| 2:35:57| this document contains more than two and a half dozen other terms and conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9357)|
| 2:36:03| that could either increase KCSO expenditures or result in adding more work to KCSO's workload.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9363)|
| 2:36:14| You will find those terms and conditions highlighted in green on your copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| Now, here's what ICE will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9382)|
| 2:36:25| In addition to providing instructors and training materials, ICE will do the following for KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9385)|
| 2:36:33| If funds are available, ICE will purchase, maintain, and install high-tech support equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9393)|
| 2:36:40| as well as providing technical support and software updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| Number two, I'm quoting now from page five, paragraph two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9405)|
| 2:36:51| If ICE determines the training provides a direct service to the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9411)|
| 2:36:57| and it is in the best interest of the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| the government may issue travel orders to selected personnel to reimburse travel, housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9420)|
| 2:37:08| and per diem expenses only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| The agency, namely KCSO, remains responsible for paying the salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9431)|
| 2:37:16| and benefits of the selected personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9436)|
| 2:37:21| Now, that is all they offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9441)|
| 2:37:26| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9446)|
| 2:37:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9450)|
| 2:37:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9451)|
| 2:37:32| Next, we have Megan Conley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9452)|
| 2:37:37| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9457)|
| 2:37:38| If you'd give us your address, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9458)|
| 2:37:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9461)|
| 2:37:42| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9462)|
| 2:37:43| My name is Megan Conley, 1024 Sugar Creek Lane, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9463)|
| 2:37:48| I'm here to express my concern about our county's possible 287G agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9468)|
| 2:37:53| 287G deputizes local police to act as immigration agents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9473)|
| 2:37:57| Though this may sound reasonable, independent research has consistently found that 287G is rife with problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9477)|
| 2:38:04| including lack of transparency and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9484)|
| 2:38:08| Three years ago, the Nonpartisan Police Foundation found that immigration enforcement by local police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9488)|
| 2:38:14| undermines their core public safety mission, diverts scarce resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9494)|
| 2:38:20| increases their exposure to liability and litigation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9500)|
| 2:38:24| and exacerbates fear in communities already distrustful of police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9504)|
| 2:38:29| That same year, our county applied for the full 287G program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9509)|
| 2:38:34| which includes a task force model and a jail model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9514)|
| 2:38:37| The jail model, which has been authorized for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9517)|
| 2:38:41| will allow designated officers to determine someone's immigration status once they have been arrested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9521)|
| 2:38:47| regardless of whether the arrest is related to their immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9527)|
| 2:38:53| The task force model has received a lot of criticism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9533)|
| 2:38:56| but the jail model is also problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| Not only will it force our county jail to waste time and resources processing immigrants with no criminal record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| or with only minor infractions, such as traffic violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9546)|
| 2:39:10| the jail model may encourage police officers who are not deputized as immigration agents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9550)|
| 2:39:16| to use the power of arrest to check immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9556)|
| 2:39:20| The cause for arrest may be something as simple as a traffic violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9560)|
| 2:39:25| For example, perhaps a driver fails to use a turn signal or has a broken taillight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9565)|
| 2:39:30| A deputy stops the driver, not because he cares about the traffic violation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9570)|
| 2:39:34| but because he has a hunch that the driver is undocumented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9574)|
| 2:39:38| This is called a pretextual stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9578)|
| 2:39:41| If the deputy thinks the driver is undocumented because she is Latina,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9581)|
| 2:39:45| this is also called racial profiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| The driver has a legal ID but does not have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9588)|
| 2:39:51| Instead of issuing a citation for driving without a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9591)|
| 2:39:54| which is what often happens in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9594)|
| 2:39:57| the county deputy may take the driver to jail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9597)|
| 2:40:00| where she will be interrogated about her immigration status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9600)|
| 2:40:04| For the immigrant stopped with a broken taillight who ends up in deportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9604)|
| 2:40:08| and the community that hears about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9608)|
| 2:40:11| it doesn't matter if this happens through the task force model or the jail model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| For the crime victim who is now afraid to call the police, it doesn't matter either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9616)|
| 2:40:21| Any form of 287G offers too much risk and too little reward for our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9621)|
| 2:40:27| I would like to pose some questions to Sheriff Jones about these risks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9627)|
| 2:40:32| How will he properly monitor and train his deputies to prevent and combat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9632)|
| 2:40:37| the use of racial profiling in pretextual stops?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| How will he ensure that 287G does not undermine trust in the police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| How will he combat the negative effects of 287G on crime reporting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9646)|
| 2:40:52| These are just a few of the questions I have about the implementation of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9652)|
| 2:40:56| I would like to express these concerns directly to the sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9656)|
| 2:41:00| and be assured that he has given them the full weight of his consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9660)|
| 2:41:04| before he signs the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9664)|
| 2:41:06| Like others here today, I have tried on many occasions to express my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9666)|
| 2:41:11| I've called the sheriff's office and gone in person to make an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| I did not expect to meet with the sheriff right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9675)|
| 2:41:19| and I did not expect the sheriff would have immediate answers to all of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| I did expect that Sheriff Jones would want to hear our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9684)|
| 2:41:28| so that he can take these with him when he continues his dialogue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9688)|
| 2:41:32| with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| I believe that residents have the right to be heard about decisions that directly impact us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9695)|
| 2:41:39| especially when the decision-maker is a public official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| However, it has been months since we started calling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9702)|
| 2:41:44| and we still do not have a timeline for an appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9704)|
| 2:41:47| Even more concerning to me is the fact that the sheriff's website states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| that he may move forward with 287G because of his duty, I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9711)|
| 2:41:55| to protect the rights of United States citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9715)|
| 2:41:59| I respectfully suggest that the sheriff's duty is to protect all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9719)|
| 2:42:03| regardless of whether we are citizens or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| If someone in my community has been victimized, assaulted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| I don't care if that person is a citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| I care that the sheriff and his deputies track down the person who is responsible for the assault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9732)|
| 2:42:17| When the sheriff says he is here to protect U.S. citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9737)|
| 2:42:20| I worry that he is more concerned about immigration status than keeping our community safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9740)|
| 2:42:26| I would like to hear from the sheriff so that I can put these fears to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9746)|
| 2:42:31| So I'm here today to respectfully ask that you encourage the sheriff to meet with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9751)|
| 2:42:34| to hear our concerns, and to work with the community to develop a shared solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9754)|
| 2:42:39| that will ensure the safety of all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9759)|
| 2:42:41| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9761)|
| 2:42:43| Thank you. We appreciate your being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9763)|
| 2:42:45| Next we have Josh Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| Josh Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9769)|
| 2:42:57| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9777)|
| 2:42:58| And if you give us your address, you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9778)|
| 2:43:00| Josh Wright, 415 East Springdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| I didn't get to prepare my speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| I had a lot to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9785)|
| 2:43:07| But I just wanted to talk about the effects on business that this may have, you know, the 287G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9787)|
| 2:43:13| Basically, I mean, from what you read in the news,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9793)|
| 2:43:17| you'll see that it becomes a license to racially profile in a lot of these communities that adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| And I don't think that's good for our business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9803)|
| 2:43:29| I work with a lot of contractors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| Quite a few of them are people of color, you know, the owners and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9812)|
| 2:43:37| So what's this going to do to them when they see that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9817)|
| 2:43:41| people all around the country see that Knox County has become a place where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9821)|
| 2:43:46| with a license to racially profile their citizens or the people living there, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9826)|
| 2:43:55| I don't know if you read in an article that I saw, it's in CNN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9835)|
| 2:44:00| where Knoxville has actually become one of the top ten places for economic improvement between 2000 and 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9840)|
| 2:44:10| But I'd say that'll dwindle pretty quickly when people realize that if they come there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9850)|
| 2:44:16| they're liable to get thrown in jail just because of the color of their skin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9856)|
| 2:44:20| I don't think that's Knox County that we want to be a part of or that we can be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9860)|
| 2:44:27| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9867)|
| 2:44:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9870)|
| 2:44:31| Daniel Snyder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267120723?start=9871)|
