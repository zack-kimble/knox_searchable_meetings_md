| 2:09:22| Property located at 203 Fox Road, parcel ID 131LA017| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7762)|
| 2:09:30| in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7773)|
| 2:09:40| Lindsay Libby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7780)|
| 2:09:42| Do you know who that is, Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7784)|
| 2:09:45| But I think that last month, if I remember correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7785)|
| 2:09:51| and Commissioner Jay could help me out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7791)|
| 2:09:53| but didn't the applicant ask to have it delayed until September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| so they could attend their child's soccer game or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| I don't remember the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7802)|
| 2:10:04| I know it was asked to be deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7804)|
| 2:10:07| but I don't know what the specificity is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| And they were aware at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| that it would be deferred to our September meeting then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| Yes, that's correct, and they were notified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7814)|
| 2:10:20| Well, we have a couple more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7820)|
| 2:10:21| I mean, this is two shots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7821)|
| 2:10:22| so I guess I'll make a motion to deny the rezoning then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7822)|
| 2:10:27| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7827)|
| 2:10:29| Let's move it to the back of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7829)|
| 2:10:31| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| That's correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7832)|
| 2:10:34| OK, yes, if that's OK with you, Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7834)|
| 2:10:36| we'll move it to the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7836)|
| 2:10:38| We have a few more items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Mr. Chairman, I think we're always trying to find ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| to make sure that people's applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7843)|
| 2:10:45| if they get the best chance at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7845)|
| 2:10:47| perhaps our staff could reach out and try to make a quick call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7847)|
| 2:10:50| and see if they have any intention of being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| If we have their contact, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7853)|
| 2:10:55| Can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7855)|
| 2:11:12| I think you have a question, Commissioner Ward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| if you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7874)|
| 2:11:15| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7875)|
| 2:11:17| Well, I mean, I have the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7877)|
| 2:11:20| Commissioner Smith, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7880)|
| 2:11:24| I believe the first time the guy, he requested a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| Is that not correct, Mr. J?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| Yeah, I'll try to find the email and double-check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7892)|
| 2:11:37| This time it's a no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7897)|
| 2:11:38| This will be the first no-show, not the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7898)|
| 2:11:42| We've set a precedent tonight to let applicants attend by Zoom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7902)|
| 2:11:47| Is this something we're going to look to do in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7907)|
| 2:11:52| I think it was an extenuating circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7912)|
| 2:11:54| due to an incapacitation on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7914)|
| 2:11:59| I mean, it's obviously up to the body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7919)|
| 2:12:01| whether we want to suspend the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| but I would think we would only do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| in very unusual circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7924)|
| 2:12:08| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7928)|
| 2:12:10| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| On that one, this lady was in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| Kind of hard for her to come for a three-minute meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| all the way from California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| That's why I requested to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7937)|
| 2:12:21| I don't know if I would do that for somebody that's local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7947)|
| 2:12:31| Mr. Morton, did you have one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7952)|
| 2:12:34| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| You're leading on the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=7956)|

| 2:13:25| Seeing none, I'll call on Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8009)|
| 2:13:32| approve the Northwest County Sector Plan Amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| to LDR Low Density Residential slash HP Hillside Protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8014)|
| 2:13:39| because of recent expansions in wastewater treatment capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| and the addition of new schools by a vote of 7 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8021)|
| 2:13:47| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| Mr. Caldwell, would you like to speak to this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| Just to say that we've been working with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| and are willing to make a compromise on the density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8036)|
| 2:14:04| that we would appreciate your approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8044)|
| 2:14:15| Did you say an amount of the compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8055)|
| 2:14:17| for the dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8057)|
| 2:14:20| That's the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| Yeah, we're actually on the Sector Plan Amendment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8063)|
| 2:14:25| I know, but from the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8065)|
| 2:14:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| Are there any questions from any of the commissioners of the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8072)|
| 2:14:37| I'm going to turn the floor to Commission District 6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| either for a motion or for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| Motion to approve Low Density Residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| as recommended by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8088)|

| 2:14:58| to approve the Sector Plan Amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8098)|

| 2:15:03| and a second by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8103)|
| 2:15:06| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8106)|
| 2:15:11| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8113)|
| 2:15:14| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8114)|
| 2:15:16| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| Next item, please stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8119)|

| 2:15:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8157)|
| 2:15:58| Is there any opposition to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8158)|
| 2:16:01| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8162)|

| 2:16:08| by a vote of 7 to 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8168)|

| 2:16:13| Any questions for the applicant or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8173)|
| 2:16:17| Mr. Caldwell kind of spoke to this already, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8177)|
| 2:16:20| on the previous item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| There are no questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8184)|
| 2:16:26| This is for a planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8186)|
| 2:16:29| Why on the last one and this one, why was it so contentious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8189)|
| 2:16:33| that it was a split vote, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8193)|
| 2:16:36| Do you happen to remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8196)|
| 2:16:37| Because I know this was back in March or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| I believe, if I recall, and it was a number of months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| it was around the density and the hillsides that are on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8205)|
| 2:16:53| It does have some slope associated with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| so there's some topography considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8216)|
| 2:17:00| and also its location along this curve on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8220)|
| 2:17:05| I believe those were the conversations that were had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8225)|
| 2:17:10| So, Mr. Caldwell, so then you agreed to drop it to three dwelling units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8230)|
| 2:17:15| not lower?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8235)|
| 2:17:16| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8236)|
| 2:17:18| We would actually be happy to lower it to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8238)|
| 2:17:27| If I may, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8247)|
| 2:17:31| Mr. Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8252)|
| 2:17:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8253)|
| 2:17:34| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8254)|
| 2:17:35| I have met at length with Mr. Caldwell on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8255)|
| 2:17:40| and you all may know the state of Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8260)|
| 2:17:46| and how it's just been just about developed to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8266)|
| 2:17:51| And I applaud you, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8271)|
| 2:17:57| for being so agreeable to looking at a two per acre as this really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8277)|
| 2:18:08| It's not quite so painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8288)|
| 2:18:11| And I'm very appreciative that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8291)|
| 2:18:14| and his family were willing to consider the needs of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8294)|
| 2:18:18| and what was happening in that immediate area in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8298)|
| 2:18:24| So, with the Chair's permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8304)|
| 2:18:26| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion to accept a two per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8306)|
| 2:18:36| on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| I have a motion from Commissioner Hill to approve plant residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8320)|
| 2:18:46| at a density of two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8326)|
| 2:18:49| and second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8329)|
| 2:18:51| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8331)|
| 2:18:53| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8333)|
| 2:18:55| I, too, would like to echo what the Caldwell family has done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8335)|
| 2:18:59| over the years not only on Campbell Station Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| but also Coward Mill Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| and what the members of the family have done to make Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8345)|
| 2:19:11| what it is today with all the beautiful flowers that we see every spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8351)|
| 2:19:16| But I do appreciate what you're doing for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8356)|

| 2:20:52| and we would like to rezone it to PR three units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8452)|
| 2:20:56| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8456)|

| 2:22:41| Seeing none, I will look to Ms. Brooks to remind us of the recommendation on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8561)|
| 2:22:47| Planning Commission's recommendation was to deny CA General Business zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8567)|
| 2:22:51| because it is not consistent with the Northeast County Sector Plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| and could cause adverse impacts for neighboring residential properties by a vote of 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8582)|
| 2:23:04| Sir, did you want to speak at all to this appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8584)|
| 2:23:07| I think this was deferred for 30 days because we really couldn't take action based on the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| Yeah, we're still hoping to get CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8597)|
| 2:23:19| We talked to people, and they say it's going to be really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8599)|
| 2:23:30| but we're still hoping that we can get CA zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8610)|
| 2:23:33| because we, on the Neighborhood Commercial Sector Plan, which is approved for neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8613)|
| 2:23:42| it's kind of hard with the setbacks, and also it's hard to do what we want to do with what this sector plan proposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8622)|
| 2:23:55| We really need to get CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8635)|
| 2:23:58| And if we can't get your answer tonight here, we need another 30 days to still do some homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8638)|
| 2:24:11| Okay. Do any commissioners have any comments or questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| Commissioner Daley, I'll look to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8655)|
| 2:24:17| Yeah, this is a question for the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8657)|
| 2:24:21| I think that tonight we can make a motion to deny his appeal and leave as planning's vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8661)|
| 2:24:31| or we could send it back for a second plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| If there's another option, do you see another option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| I understand that there's a different type of zoning you can ask for other than what you're asking for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| What you have before the county commission today, or this evening, is this one issue for CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8686)|
| 2:24:56| And that's what's before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8696)|
| 2:24:59| If your rules provide that if it's turned down, they can't reapply for that for 12 months, I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8699)|
| 2:25:07| One option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| I think all that's before this, all the commission I think is able to do is decide on what's before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8710)|
| 2:25:18| I believe that before us is his appeal to be approved or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8718)|
| 2:25:26| If we deny his appeal for commercial, I believe Amy, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8726)|
| 2:25:34| he can come back and ask for a neighborhood commercial within a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8734)|
| 2:25:38| That's a change of the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8738)|
| 2:25:40| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8740)|
| 2:25:42| So he can come back next month and ask for a neighborhood commercial on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8742)|
| 2:25:49| I think that the question, I see the question before us tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8749)|
| 2:25:53| do we approve his appeal and send it back to planning, or do we deny his appeal and it's denied commercially?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8753)|
| 2:26:04| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8764)|
| 2:26:06| Commissioner Jay, your light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8766)|
| 2:26:09| I just wanted some clarification on what was being proposed on the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| and specifically for the business and why it did not comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8772)|
| 2:26:16| I just wanted to make sure I clearly understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8776)|
| 2:26:19| Do you know, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8779)|
| 2:26:21| I would defer to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8781)|
| 2:26:23| Can you tell us what you were proposing to put on this so we can determine why it was not applicable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8783)|
| 2:26:30| Neighborhood commercial is really not working what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8790)|
| 2:26:36| We have a contractor's business, and we want to have our business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8796)|
| 2:26:43| And neighborhood commercial does not allow to have the setbacks are really, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8803)|
| 2:26:51| So you were proposing like a contractor's yard company?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8811)|
| 2:26:54| Yeah, well, that's what I'm planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8814)|
| 2:26:56| I'm not saying that's what I'm going to do, but it's just really limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8816)|
| 2:27:03| very limited small business that I don't know in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8823)|
| 2:27:10| It's the property is so like it's so surrounded by trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8830)|
| 2:27:16| You really need to, I mean, to do neighborhood commercial, it's not just working for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8836)|
| 2:27:24| It's, we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8844)|
| 2:27:28| Can I be alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8848)|
| 2:27:30| Amelia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8850)|
| 2:27:31| You have to really sort of speak right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8851)|
| 2:27:33| Amelia Gustuk, 7820 East Emory Road, Court in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| This property is very irregular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8858)|
| 2:27:41| It's like somewhat of a trapezoid shape, and there's a septic tank right in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8861)|
| 2:27:49| There's no sewer available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| For us to build anything on it at this point is like we need a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| a little less setbacks, at least on the sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8876)|
| 2:27:59| And then the neighborhood commercial is 20 feet or 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8879)|
| 2:28:03| That's why we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8883)|
| 2:28:06| They also, right now they're improving the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| There's a left turn lane onto Roberts Road right there at the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| So we saw one a couple before this where there's change in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| I don't know if you'd want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8900)|
| 2:28:22| Has any of you been up there to see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| That's a very industrial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8904)|
| 2:28:26| And everyone we talked to said we can't believe that you're not getting the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8906)|
| 2:28:31| Within 500 feet there's a property that's in a neighborhood commercial sector plan that's zoned industrial and CB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8911)|
| 2:28:41| So we really hope you'll reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8921)|
| 2:28:47| Could I ask for some clarification, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8927)|
| 2:28:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8930)|
| 2:28:51| So in conversations that I've had with Steve Elliott with county codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8931)|
| 2:28:58| so the CN district does permit outdoor storage of materials, products, and equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8938)|
| 2:29:04| And county codes, you know, if you wanted to proceed with the CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8944)|
| 2:29:10| Planning Commission could consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8950)|
| 2:29:12| because the uses are similar for outdoor storage and a contractor's yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8952)|
| 2:29:17| that the Planning Commission can make a use determination that those are those similar enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8957)|
| 2:29:21| and could that be considered in the neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8961)|
| 2:29:29| Commissioner Dayton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8969)|
| 2:29:31| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| Sounds like to me that you've got a real good case at BZA to ask for variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8973)|
| 2:29:41| shaper the irregular lot, plus you save your safety tank there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8981)|
| 2:29:46| Have you ever heard of the Board of Zoning Appeals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8986)|
| 2:29:49| That's where you go to to ask for situations like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| Since you have got neighborhood commercial, what you want to do could be a neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| but your problem is your setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| I would suggest that this commission postpone this for 30 or probably more like 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9002)|
| 2:30:09| If you're willing to go to BZA, it's $250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9009)|
| 2:30:13| Go to BZA and ask for these variances on the setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9013)|
| 2:30:17| And that way you may not need commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9017)|
| 2:30:21| You could have the setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9021)|
| 2:30:23| Am I correct in that statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9023)|
| 2:30:27| Would he not need to go and apply for the neighborhood commercial zoning before he could go to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9027)|
| 2:30:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9032)|
| 2:30:33| He's currently zoned ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9033)|
| 2:30:34| And that's what I was going to say, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| is that my understanding is rezoning would need to happen before they could go to BZA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9036)|
| 2:30:41| to request those variances to the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9041)|
| 2:30:43| so the zone was what they needed for the use that they were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9043)|
| 2:30:48| I'm not in favor of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| I would be in favor of neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| if you're going to BZA and ask for these variances there at BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9052)|
| 2:30:57| because looking at the shape of your lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9057)|
| 2:31:01| plus you said that there's a safety tank filled there already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9061)|
| 2:31:04| and there's no surge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9064)|
| 2:31:06| There's reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9066)|
| 2:31:09| I can't tell you what BZA would do, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9069)|
| 2:31:11| but I've been on BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9071)|
| 2:31:14| I see irregular lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9074)|
| 2:31:16| I see situations like this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9076)|
| 2:31:20| In my opinion, you may have a good catch statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9080)|
| 2:31:23| Does that make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9083)|
| 2:31:27| Well, that's also a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| We don't know if it's going to happen and involve more finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9089)|
| 2:31:36| We have six children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9096)|
| 2:31:38| We're trying to just get CA so we have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9098)|
| 2:31:44| fully open to do what we need to do and, of course, comply by, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9104)|
| 2:31:52| whatever the ‑‑I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| My English is not very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| With the regulation that it needs to be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| not like we want to do something, you know, crazy over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9124)|
| 2:32:07| just having a family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9127)|
| 2:32:10| And neighborhood commercial is mainly it's to serve people around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9130)|
| 2:32:16| and our business, it's not really serving people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9136)|
| 2:32:22| And we don't have any neighbors here that even want to complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| Well, I would vote to deny your appeal now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9149)|
| 2:32:34| leaving that neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9154)|
| 2:32:36| So that's ‑‑ I'm trying to help you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9156)|
| 2:32:39| but I would vote no on your appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9159)|
| 2:32:42| That's where I would vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9162)|
| 2:32:46| Can you justify properties all around it with the CB, CA, I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9166)|
| 2:32:50| within 500 feet from it, people doing their business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9170)|
| 2:32:54| Why would you deny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9174)|
| 2:32:56| How would our business hurt anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9176)|
| 2:33:00| Yes, ma'am, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9180)|
| 2:33:01| We're going to actually speak to that in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9181)|
| 2:33:03| I'm going to let Commissioner Buslett before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9183)|
| 2:33:06| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9186)|
| 2:33:08| They've got a business, and one of the contentions was outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| And I don't think they're going to have that outdoor storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9192)|
| 2:33:14| like we think outdoor storage is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| But this is in your district, and I've been out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9197)|
| 2:33:20| and around it is commercial‑type applications all around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9200)|
| 2:33:26| And, again, if they're doing what they say they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9206)|
| 2:33:34| and sometimes they don't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9214)|
| 2:33:37| but I think they're really honest about I get that feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9217)|
| 2:33:41| They're wanting to get their business on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9221)|
| 2:33:44| And we just keep delaying it, which is costing them money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9224)|
| 2:33:48| And, again, it's your district, Mr. Beaver,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9228)|
| 2:33:53| but there's a lot of commercial around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9233)|
| 2:33:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Thank you, Commissioner Buslett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9237)|
| 2:33:58| There certainly is, but I have a question of, well, Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9238)|
| 2:34:00| I'll recognize you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| The question is for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9242)|
| 2:34:06| Director Brooks, continuously to the, I guess I'll call it the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9246)|
| 2:34:13| there is a piece of CA and CB property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9253)|
| 2:34:16| To the north there's CA and Light Industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9256)|
| 2:34:19| There's also a piece of Industrial continuous to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9259)|
| 2:34:25| There's a whole lot of commercial activity right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9265)|
| 2:34:30| As the applicant's trying to describe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9270)|
| 2:34:33| neighborhood commercial is a zoning that's designed to provide services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9273)|
| 2:34:38| to the direct neighbor's community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9278)|
| 2:34:42| There's already neighborhood commercial across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9282)|
| 2:34:50| What would be the detrimental facts of this being zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9290)|
| 2:34:55| as opposed to neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9295)|
| 2:34:57| other than the use and review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9297)|
| 2:35:02| and probably some landscaping and setback differences?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9302)|
| 2:35:08| For the purposes of zoning, we consider ag to be a residential district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9308)|
| 2:35:13| And so that would be one of the considerations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9313)|
| 2:35:16| is putting a commercial use up against residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9316)|
| 2:35:20| which you'll see on the backside of the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9320)|
| 2:35:27| Isn't that what we have across the street of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9327)|
| 2:35:33| Neighborhood commercial and ag and then CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9333)|
| 2:35:35| with what looks like residential houses behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9335)|
| 2:35:37| It's neighborhood commercial, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9337)|
| 2:35:39| Some of the CA has been here for quite a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| Some of it predates the last sector plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9342)|
| 2:35:50| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9350)|
| 2:35:51| There is light industrial as well on the other side of the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9351)|
| 2:35:57| next to that CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9357)|
| 2:36:04| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9364)|
| 2:36:06| So, Ms. Brooks, here I think is the dilemma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| I'm going to assume that all of it predates the latest sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9369)|
| 2:36:15| I actually can't imagine County Commission coming along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| and zoning something that isn't consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9378)|
| 2:36:20| But they haven't done that in my three years on this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9380)|
| 2:36:24| So there are a lot of commercial zonings around there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9384)|
| 2:36:29| but they're grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9389)|
| 2:36:31| They were already zoned that way when the current sector plan was put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9391)|
| 2:36:35| The dilemma this commission faces now is you're asking for a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9395)|
| 2:36:40| that is not allowed under the current sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9400)|
| 2:36:45| We almost have no grounds to grant this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9405)|
| 2:36:51| Sector plans allow certain zones within them once they're put in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9411)|
| 2:36:56| and CA is not one of those zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9416)|
| 2:36:58| That's why this was denied at planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9418)|
| 2:37:01| That's why this body really has no grounds to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9421)|
| 2:37:06| This really needed a sector plan amendment and then the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9426)|
| 2:37:12| Is it that hard to go back and try to change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| I'll ask Ms. Brooks that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9435)|
| 2:37:17| Now that this has gotten to the point of appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9437)|
| 2:37:20| is it possible to not deny this so that they don't have to wait a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9440)|
| 2:37:26| to ask for a sector plan change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9446)|
| 2:37:28| The sector plan was denied at planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9448)|
| 2:37:31| It was not appealed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9453)|
| 2:37:34| I don't know the history beyond why those don't get appealed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9454)|
| 2:37:37| I believe that they could withdraw this appeal and then appeal the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9457)|
| 2:37:42| but it's probably too late to do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9462)|
| 2:37:46| Oh, they can't appeal a sector plan to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9466)|
| 2:37:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9468)|
| 2:37:50| Mr. J., Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9470)|
| 2:37:52| would it not be in the legislative powers of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| to take a vote on the sector plan and then take this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9476)|
| 2:38:02| without having to go back through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9482)|
| 2:38:04| Do we not have the legislative power to make that change with a vote of commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9484)|
| 2:38:09| I would have thought so, but I'm being told that we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| Mr. Morton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9492)|
| 2:38:14| Mr. Chairman, there's two mechanisms to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9494)|
| 2:38:19| One is the NPC coming this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9499)|
| 2:38:23| and the other is this legislative body can initiate an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9503)|
| 2:38:27| and transmit the amendment back to the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| For the NPC, once they consider the amendment and it's approved or not approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9511)|
| 2:38:36| take action, it comes back for a majority vote of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9516)|
| 2:38:41| But if they deny it, can we still hear it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| It sounds like we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9526)|
| 2:38:48| There's two different ways to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| They start it or this commission starts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9531)|
| 2:38:54| Either way, though, it has to pass both bodies, it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9534)|
| 2:38:58| But if it starts here and it's approved and sent back and they deny it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9538)|
| 2:39:02| then we can still overturn that coming back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9542)|
| 2:39:05| So we can choose to change the sector plan if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9545)|
| 2:39:10| I'm hearing differing voices, so we may...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9550)|
| 2:39:15| Well, I would just like to see these applicants get the most fair shake they can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9555)|
| 2:39:21| What I don't want to see happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9561)|
| 2:39:24| I don't want to see us have to take action, deny this zoning appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9564)|
| 2:39:29| and then them have to wait a year to ask for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9569)|
| 2:39:33| So I'm trying to find a way for them to ask for a sector plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| but they've already asked for one and it was denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9577)|
| 2:39:40| Mr. Smith and then Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9580)|
| 2:39:44| Yes, the process is if we wish to change the sector plan, we send it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9584)|
| 2:39:49| We don't vote. Amy, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9589)|
| 2:39:52| We don't vote on what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9592)|
| 2:39:54| We just make a vote to send back the sector plan to MPC to consider a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9594)|
| 2:40:01| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9601)|
| 2:40:04| That is my understanding of how it's been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9604)|
| 2:40:09| I think what Mr. Morton was sharing is that there are two different paths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9609)|
| 2:40:14| that maybe that second one hasn't been taken advantage of as often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9614)|
| 2:40:18| is that you all direct Planning Commission to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9618)|
| 2:40:21| like you already make a decision on the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9621)|
| 2:40:24| and send it back to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9624)|
| 2:40:26| And then regardless of their action, it comes back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9626)|
| 2:40:30| For final approval, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| I want to recognize Commissioner Ward because Commissioner Bradley has already spoken on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9635)|
| 2:40:38| They can still go and do neighborhood commercial and ask for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9638)|
| 2:40:42| That's what I talked about last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9642)|
| 2:40:47| That's still an open avenue for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9647)|
| 2:40:49| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9649)|
| 2:40:50| It would apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9650)|
| 2:40:53| Ms. Brooks also said that she can see that being an avenue as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9653)|
| 2:40:56| So it's not like there's no avenue forward for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9656)|
| 2:40:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9659)|
| 2:41:00| That's actually probably the path of least resistance is that path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| If they choose to apply for neighborhood commercial, can they do that on the spot tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9663)|
| 2:41:07| or do they have to go through the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9667)|
| 2:41:09| They'd have to refile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9669)|
| 2:41:11| We can, but they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| Commissioner Smith, you were going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| I believe we could send it back to MPC asking for them to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9676)|
| 2:41:21| a sector plan change to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9681)|
| 2:41:25| For a sector plan change to allow for CA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9685)|
| 2:41:29| Neighborhood commercial wouldn't require a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| Neighborhood commercial with a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| You're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| We're on appeal right now, so if we deny the appeal tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9694)|
| 2:41:37| they can file neighborhood commercial with a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9697)|
| 2:41:41| Variance would go underneath the review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9701)|
| 2:41:42| They would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9702)|
| 2:41:43| It would come then to commission, and then we would approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9703)|
| 2:41:45| And under the sector plan, that would make the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| That's what I tried to say last month is not giving them advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9708)|
| 2:41:52| You're not supposed to, but giving them a path forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9712)|
| 2:41:56| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9716)|
| 2:41:58| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9718)|
| 2:41:59| Mr. Smith is correct, if you all remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| The tools came before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| They wanted a sector plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9724)|
| 2:42:07| We had to send it back to planning for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9727)|
| 2:42:12| They come back at 15-0, the same as which I think this would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9732)|
| 2:42:16| if we sent it back at 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9736)|
| 2:42:19| I still think their best way is to go neighborhood commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9739)|
| 2:42:23| and try for the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9743)|
| 2:42:28| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9748)|
| 2:42:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9750)|
| 2:42:32| Commissioner Daly, you're correct, but it was a regular zoning item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| It was not an appeal that was sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9756)|
| 2:42:39| That's our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9759)|
| 2:42:40| This is an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9760)|
| 2:42:41| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9761)|
| 2:42:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9762)|
| 2:42:44| And this is part of the rules that we need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| When an appeal is brought before us, the whole thing needs to be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| before us, the sector plan plus the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9771)|
| 2:42:54| And it did not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9774)|
| 2:43:00| Anybody more confused than ever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9780)|
| 2:43:03| I think, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| I think going back to what Commissioner Smith said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9789)|
| 2:43:11| I think we do have a proper action to be able to vote to send it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9791)|
| 2:43:16| to MPC asking for the sector plan change to whatever we make the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9796)|
| 2:43:21| to be and then approval of this so these people can start their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9801)|
| 2:43:26| and get on with their life and move forward with some certainty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| I believe we can make that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9810)|
| 2:43:32| And it's a once down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| And if they somehow were to deny it, it would come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9814)|
| 2:43:37| and we could overturn it again if we needed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| But we have the governing power to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9820)|
| 2:43:43| Thank you, Commissioner Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9823)|
| 2:43:44| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9824)|
| 2:43:45| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the denial of the CA general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9825)|
| 2:43:51| business zone for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9831)|
| 2:43:56| I have a motion from Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| and a second from Commissioner Daly to deny the CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9838)|
| 2:44:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| If this vote is taken and passes, does this become a debt issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| and takes away our ability to request that a sector plan change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9849)|
| 2:44:14| take place for neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9854)|
| 2:44:20| They don't need a sector plan change for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9860)|
| 2:44:24| We're on a zoning appeal, but not on a regular zoning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| That's my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9868)|
| 2:44:29| It's a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9869)|
| 2:44:31| We can't make a decision on a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9871)|
| 2:44:33| This is a zoning appeal, which is set on a regular zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9873)|
| 2:44:38| So this is a separate thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9878)|
| 2:44:40| If they want to go to the theater tonight and they want to go walk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9880)|
| 2:44:43| and see Amy tomorrow morning, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9883)|
| 2:44:46| I know, John, but I'm trying to keep them from having to pay fees again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9886)|
| 2:44:50| because they got bad advice on what to apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9890)|
| 2:44:52| Commissioner Ward, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9892)|
| 2:44:55| If we deny this, can we as a body make a motion separately from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9895)|
| 2:45:02| to send the property down for what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| which is the neighborhood sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9908)|
| 2:45:13| with the neighborhood commercial with the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9913)|
| 2:45:15| So we're actually generating it, not them tomorrow paying more fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9915)|
| 2:45:20| So if you take the initial vote to deny this now to deny the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9920)|
| 2:45:26| and then we would go as a body, make a motion to do that part second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9926)|
| 2:45:30| be two different pieces instead of trying to roll it into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9930)|
| 2:45:33| We could, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9933)|
| 2:45:37| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9937)|
| 2:45:40| I just want to be clear that I know all the facts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9940)|
| 2:45:44| This is the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9944)|
| 2:45:46| Director Brooks, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9946)|
| 2:45:48| currently allows for neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9948)|
| 2:45:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9951)|
| 2:45:52| So we do not need a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9952)|
| 2:45:56| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9956)|
| 2:45:57| They would need, if they were to try under neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9957)|
| 2:46:01| they would need to go under that zoning with a variance and go before BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9961)|
| 2:46:07| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9967)|
| 2:46:08| They would need to request a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9968)|
| 2:46:10| I know it's confusing because they're both called neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9970)|
| 2:46:12| It's a rezoning to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| Because it is currently zoned at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9975)|
| 2:46:17| Yes, but they would comply with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9977)|
| 2:46:19| But we do not need a sector plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9979)|
| 2:46:21| Not to go to neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9981)|
| 2:46:25| I'm going to ask the applicant first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9985)|
| 2:46:28| Is that acceptable to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9988)|
| 2:46:32| If this body were to deny this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9992)|
| 2:46:35| is it acceptable to you to apply for a neighborhood commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9995)|
| 2:46:39| and request a variance in BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10002)|
| 2:46:44| Forgive me for saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10004)|
| 2:46:46| I think all of you who have been there, and I can see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10006)|
| 2:46:50| that you're trying, you know that that property can be a CA zoned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10010)|
| 2:46:57| because of where it is and all the industrial properties around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10017)|
| 2:47:01| But when we went to the MPC meeting the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10021)|
| 2:47:06| and I'm not trying to humiliate anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10026)|
| 2:47:08| but I remember one lady just saying, oh, that looks pink in all four corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10028)|
| 2:47:12| Looks good to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10032)|
| 2:47:14| I don't think she's been there to see that that's a very high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10034)|
| 2:47:18| like heavy commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10038)|
| 2:47:20| And if we can't, can we just defer 30 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| But we're going to try for CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10044)|
| 2:47:28| Maybe send back to MPC like somebody was trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10048)|
| 2:47:32| Commissioner Hill, I'm going to let you speak next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10052)|
| 2:47:37| What is the difference, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10057)|
| 2:47:43| between CA and neighborhood commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10063)|
| 2:47:53| There are a number of differences in the uses that are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10073)|
| 2:47:58| But as I mentioned earlier, if they want to do a contractor's yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| there's likely to be a path forward under the neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10081)|
| 2:48:06| But there are, as the applicant has stated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10086)|
| 2:48:08| there are setback requirements in the CN that are different than CA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10088)|
| 2:48:15| and that is because it is supposed to be more neighborhood oriented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10095)|
| 2:48:18| and provide some buffers to the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10098)|
| 2:48:23| I'd be happy to review the list of uses, but that's really the primary difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10103)|
| 2:48:28| There's use and review in both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10108)|
| 2:48:31| I just am thinking, y'all, we're about to become our own worst enemy here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10111)|
| 2:48:36| We just cannot let this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10116)|
| 2:48:40| We hear our log director telling us all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10120)|
| 2:48:42| you can do whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10122)|
| 2:48:46| It doesn't mean that down the road you might not get some kickback on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10126)|
| 2:48:51| but my goodness, y'all, this is a family trying to make an honest living,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10131)|
| 2:48:56| and there's no one out there even objecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| It's not like we've got all the neighbors coming up and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10140)|
| 2:49:03| don't let this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10143)|
| 2:49:07| I just suggest, Mr. Chair, we've got to fix this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10147)|
| 2:49:12| We need to let these people get down to their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| I agree, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10156)|
| 2:49:18| As the district commissioner, I have to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10158)|
| 2:49:20| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10160)|
| 2:49:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10163)|
| 2:49:25| The reason this was voted down 15-0 is because it does not fit the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10165)|
| 2:49:31| Yes, you can make a substitute motion to send it back for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10171)|
| 2:49:36| To change the sector plan, you have to have one of five conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| None of these five conditions has been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10180)|
| 2:49:43| That's why it's turned down 15-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10183)|
| 2:49:47| So, yes, you can make a substitution and send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| but if planning is doing their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| commissioners are voting like they should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| They've got to find a reason to change the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10195)|
| 2:49:59| and there was no reason to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10199)|
| 2:50:02| That is why I still say their best avenue is neighborhood commercial through a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10202)|
| 2:50:15| Seeing no other lights, we do have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10215)|
| 2:50:18| That motion is to approve the denial of this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10218)|
| 2:50:25| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10225)|
| 2:50:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10226)|
| 2:50:27| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10227)|
| 2:50:28| They did ask for a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10228)|
| 2:50:30| They did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| I don't think we need to refuse their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10231)|
| 2:50:36| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10236)|
| 2:50:37| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10237)|
| 2:50:38| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| Do we need to vote on that deferral as a substitute motion if they request it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10239)|
| 2:50:47| The rules give this committee discretion to defer this matter if they're here asking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10247)|
| 2:50:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10255)|
| 2:50:56| At the request of the applicant, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10256)|
| 2:50:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10259)|
| 2:51:02| Commissioner Buster, do you recognize?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| Now that we've beat this horse almost to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10264)|
| 2:51:07| we've got to tell them what they need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10267)|
| 2:51:10| what the next step is specifically that they need to do to get back before us next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10270)|
| 2:51:18| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10278)|
| 2:51:19| Mr. Chairman, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10279)|
| 2:51:20| Mr. Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10280)|
| 2:51:21| Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10281)|
| 2:51:22| Commissioner Buster, I would suggest that you go to Mr. Snowden and Steve Elliott| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10282)|
| 2:51:28| and make an appointment and let them tell you, walk you through things that will have to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| They're your best asset in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10294)|
| 2:51:36| Steve Elliott's in charge of codes now, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10296)|
| 2:51:39| Steve Elliott is the person who needs to sit down, and they may be able to work with you to find some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10299)|
| 2:51:46| That's my suggestion that you work with Mr. Snowden and Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10306)|
| 2:51:50| I just want to add one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| I have four boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| The older one is 19, and he is becoming right now, as we speak, very good with cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10314)|
| 2:52:04| Let's say I want a CA because I see the future, and my boys want to buy, fix cars, and sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10324)|
| 2:52:12| On neighborhood, commercial, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10332)|
| 2:52:16| You just can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10336)|
| 2:52:18| And, you know, I'm thinking not just about me but about my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10338)|
| 2:52:23| because when I saw the property for sale and I saw properties around, like, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10343)|
| 2:52:28| This is what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| That's the perfect location for my own business, you know, for whatever I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10350)|
| 2:52:36| You know, today I'm in construction, but who knows next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10356)|
| 2:52:40| Is it going to be going or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10360)|
| 2:52:43| I can switch to do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10363)|
| 2:52:45| But with this neighborhood commercial, I'm stuck with one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10365)|
| 2:52:48| You know, I'm just—my hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10368)|
| 2:52:54| We understand. Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10377)|
| 2:53:00| I think what you're hearing tonight is everybody's trying to find a way for you to find a path forward to run a family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10380)|
| 2:53:06| We're all trying to figure out a way, but it's muddled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10386)|
| 2:53:10| And I think that Mr. Snowden, Ms. Brooks, I hope they're hearing the sentiment amongst our commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10390)|
| 2:53:17| that we're trying to find a path forward so that they don't have more fees and don't have more delays but that we do it right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10397)|
| 2:53:24| because what we don't want to have happen is it sort of gets put in one way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10404)|
| 2:53:28| and then if you do change businesses or something else happens, then all of a sudden you're against a code violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10408)|
| 2:53:34| We don't want to do that because then you're going to be in worse shape, and we've been down that road before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| So I just would kindly suggest that maybe you take the 30 days that's sort of been offered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10418)|
| 2:53:45| sit down with our team, and what our team is hearing from us is we want to find—we're asking you to help us find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10425)|
| 2:53:53| And if we can, let's do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10433)|
| 2:53:56| It's hard to get there, but if we don't do it right now, it's going to be tougher down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10436)|
| 2:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10442)|
| 2:54:03| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10443)|
| 2:54:04| Can they submit another plan while this is still an appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10444)|
| 2:54:10| It's like this locked in an appeal right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10450)|
| 2:54:12| Are they even able to go another path if they wanted to if we don't deny them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10452)|
| 2:54:16| Are you asking if they can submit another rezoning request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10456)|
| 2:54:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10459)|
| 2:54:21| While this is still an appeal because technically we're going to punt this another 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10461)|
| 2:54:25| and it's still going to be locked into an appeal right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| I don't see why not, but unless the law director has a reason why they couldn't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10467)|
| 2:54:34| I'm reading the Section D of your rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10474)|
| 2:54:37| Reapplication after denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10477)|
| 2:54:39| Following denial by the Commission, no rezoning request, appeal, or subdivision plan approved request may be resubmitted for a period of 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10479)|
| 2:54:47| Provided, however, a petition for a different zoning shall be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10487)|
| 2:54:56| I think they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| They could even withdraw their appeal if they wanted to, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10498)|
| 2:55:03| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10503)|
| 2:55:05| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10505)|
| 2:55:09| I'm just not sure what the delay is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| I think the applicant has fairly well stated that neighborhood commercial is not going to work with variances, possibly even, for what he wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10512)|
| 2:55:23| I think what he wants is the flexibility to be able to have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10523)|
| 2:55:28| So, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10531)|
| 2:55:35| I think he's asking us to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10535)|
| 2:55:40| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10540)|
| 2:55:41| What do you think you can accomplish in 30 days of delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10541)|
| 2:55:45| Because if it's going to show up in front of you, it's going to do the same thing in the 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10545)|
| 2:55:52| Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| I'll say that all the uses that have been mentioned so far are uses that would be allowed in neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10553)|
| 2:55:59| So, even the vehicle repair and service is a use that would be allowed, and the use on vehicle sales, no, would not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10559)|
| 2:56:09| I mean, it does seem like they're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| So, we're happy to continue to work with them and try to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10571)|
| 2:56:17| So, you guys do want 30 days delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10577)|
| 2:56:23| We have a motion with a proper second to defer this item, postpone this item for 30 days until our October zoning meeting at the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10583)|
| 2:56:32| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| Request is granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| Mr. Snowden, I do hope your office will work with these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10598)|
| 2:56:42| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10602)|
| 2:56:56| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10616)|
| 2:56:57| Yes, Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10617)|
| 2:56:59| I do have some information on the one that we pushed back at the end of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10619)|
| 2:57:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10623)|
| 2:57:04| If it's okay to bring that up now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| Yes, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10626)|
| 2:57:07| We are dealing with item 63.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10627)|
| 2:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10630)|
| 2:57:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10631)|
| 2:57:12| On Monday, August 23rd, literally right before the meeting, the applicant, Lindsay Lieb, did ask for a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10632)|
| 2:57:23| It was for a personal matter, conflict with a child's game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10643)|
| 2:57:26| It seemed like a bit of a last minute request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10646)|
| 2:57:30| We did inform her at that time that this will be heard at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10650)|
| 2:57:34| The planning department, planning staff did also send another bit of information saying this is when it would be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10654)|
| 2:57:42| Ursula has reached out without any answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10662)|
| 2:57:44| So looking back and seeing the series of events, there's no reason that the applicant shouldn't be here and hasn't been properly noticed two, three, four times and given many opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10664)|
| 2:57:56| I don't see any reason to not move forward and deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10676)|
| 2:58:02| There was no extenuating circumstances other than personal schedule, which is something that we haven't really held things up for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10682)|
| 2:58:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10693)|
| 2:58:14| That may be true of last meeting, but we don't know if this person could be in the hospital, had a car wreck, had a flat tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10694)|
| 2:58:20| We don't know what happened tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| The last time she did give us notice, this is the first no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10708)|
| 2:58:30| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10710)|
| 2:58:33| We discussed this in the rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10713)|
| 2:58:36| This is her second chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10716)|
| 2:58:39| You know, I think that coming up in October we'll have a rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10719)|
| 2:58:43| We do need to give three strikes, which would be a third chance, which would be next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10723)|
| 2:58:49| I have no problem with her earning 30 more days, but if she don't show up next month, it's over with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10729)|
| 2:58:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10734)|
| 2:58:55| So we do need, right now it's two strikes and you're out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10735)|
| 2:58:59| Hopefully next month the rules committee will bring the board rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10739)|

| 2:59:21| You've got to say what has changed to make the sector plan go ahead or you can adjust the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10761)|
| 2:59:34| And on that one there, there was nothing there to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| There's no sewer, no new roads, nothing there fit the criteria to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10779)|
| 2:59:47| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10787)|

| 2:59:49| We've got to look at what we take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| Or we're just going to change the sector plan to change the sector plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| You better have a reason to change the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10794)|
| 2:59:57| Thank you, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10797)|
| 2:59:58| I don't think we took any such action, so I think we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10798)|
| 3:00:03| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'm inclined to, regardless of what the reason may have been, they did ask for a deferral last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10803)|
| 3:00:09| This is technically their first no-show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10809)|
| 3:00:12| So I'm inclined to postpone this to next month's zoning meeting, if you're agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10812)|
| 3:00:19| This item 63 will be postponed to the October zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10819)|
| 3:00:26| Is there any other business to come before zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10826)|
| 3:00:30| Motion to adjourn has been made by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10830)|
| 3:00:33| I don't believe we need to vote to postpone it, but we certainly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10833)|
| 3:00:38| No, as a chair, you can postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10838)|
| 3:00:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10840)|

| 3:00:44| I have a motion to adjourn by Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10844)|
| 3:00:46| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10846)|
| 3:00:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10847)|
| 3:00:48| Second by Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10848)|
| 3:00:49| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210927?start=10849)|
