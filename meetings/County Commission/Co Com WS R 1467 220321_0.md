| 0:11:27| Yes, Hanson Sell, 609 Weissgarber Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I believe we have a presentation to pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=698)|
| 0:11:49| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| And you can go ahead to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=710)|
| 0:12:08| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| Well, first off, thanks for having me again this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| It's always a pleasure to let you guys know what's going on in the housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| So I want to be quick because there's a lot of information in here, so we'll just jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| This is looking at the 2021 year-end numbers, so what happened last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=740)|
| 0:12:25| Almost 20 percent price growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| The median sale price rose pretty significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=747)|
| 0:12:30| We saw a pretty big jump in home sales, the largest in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| Active listings are down about a third just in the last year, and they're almost 70 percent lower than pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=755)|
| 0:12:44| So that really highlights how hot this market has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| And then lastly, the total sales volume, so the dollar amount of transactions, was up 40 percent this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=767)|
| 0:12:56| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| And to pull on to exactly why that's the case, on this next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| Luxury home sales were up significantly, so this was a huge portion at the top end of the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| We saw a lot of movement, particularly among those million-plus dollar homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| Go ahead to the next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=797)|
| 0:13:21| Housing costs in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| So this is looking at the end of 2020, or the start of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=802)|
| 0:13:27| You see double digits in both rents and home prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=807)|
| 0:13:31| And so this is different measures of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| People calculate it different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| But generally speaking, about 20 percent rise in home prices and rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| So it's really across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| And we are outpacing the U.S. overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| We're outpacing Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| We're outpacing Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| We're outpacing Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=833)|
| 0:13:55| We're outpacing Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=835)|
| 0:13:57| So Knoxville is seeing a particular, I mean, and you see in this graph, leading into the 2008, the Great Recession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=837)|
| 0:14:04| our prices didn't rise as quickly as the U.S. overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| But they didn't fall in the bust to the same extent as the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| But we have reversed that trend pretty substantially here in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=851)|
| 0:14:16| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| This is housing inventory in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| So as of February 2022, there were 271 listings in Knox County total, which is a pretty stark number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=862)|
| 0:14:34| We have 6,000 realtor members as part of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| So it should give you a little bit of an insight into the competition these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=879)|
| 0:14:44| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| And so this is really driven by demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=886)|
| 0:14:48| So this is pending ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| Another way to look at months of supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| So for every single active listings, there's currently 4.3 pending listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| So months of supply is about if we just, there was no more new inventory, we would have enough to last us a quarter of a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=899)|
| 0:15:08| So we are, and typically, you know, what is considered healthy is six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=908)|
| 0:15:15| And so we have a 0.25 month supply in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| And this is looking at the rental occupancy rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| So that's a little bit of where's the, what were we looking like in the rental market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=924)|
| 0:15:29| The rental market's exactly the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Our occupancy rate was up to 98.9% of market rate apartments in the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=930)|
| 0:15:40| So really substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| And you can go ahead now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| So to look a little bit into housing affordability, you can skip on past that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=946)|
| 0:15:51| You can see that from 2000, this is a look at from 2010 to 2020, you know, home values have outpaced income to a really substantial degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=951)|
| 0:16:02| particularly among that middle income group where you see there's almost a 20 percentage point gap between growth and family income and home value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=962)|
| 0:16:13| So this is really becoming a problem across the board, really for every part of the income distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| And so this is a really interesting graph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| So this was taken from listing data in December 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| So this shows if you make this amount of money, here's what percentage of the inventory you can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| So the median income is right in between that $50,000 to $75,000 range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| You can afford just 36% of active listings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| So not only do we only have 270-something listings, the person making a median income can only afford about a third of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1008)|
| 0:16:57| So in essence, two-thirds of the population are fighting over the bottom one-third of listings, which is really quite insane when you think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1017)|
| 0:17:09| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1029)|
| 0:17:11| So looking at housing wealth, so from 2010 to 2020, aggregate housing wealth, so the value of the housing stock rose about $20 billion in the Knoxville metro area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1031)|
| 0:17:24| But at the same time, housing inequality rose fairly substantially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| So you can see here 74% of that $20 billion in aggregate housing wealth went to people making more than $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1050)|
| 0:17:40| And what you can see at the very bottom is that we, as a metro area, have 20,000 less low-income homeowners than we did a decade ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1060)|
| 0:17:52| which really highlights the fact that homeownership is increasingly unattainable for people who are making the median income or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1072)|
| 0:18:01| It's nearly impossible with the competition today, the prevalence of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| It's really substantial and will have some pretty long-term impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1087)|
| 0:18:13| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| So this is looking at the share of housing wealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| And just to illustrate, so in 2010, the plurality of housing wealth was in the middle class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1097)|
| 0:18:24| They had 43.5% of housing wealth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| It went down, and now high income has the plurality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| They saw the largest rise in housing wealth, and low-income homeowners saw a fairly big decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| So essentially we have fewer low-income homeowners, so obviously their share of the housing wealth is going to decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| But those wealth gains that we talk about as being the American dream are increasingly less available to people who can't afford home prices here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1125)|
| 0:18:56| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| So looking at the new construction market, new production is really, that's the answer to this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| You can see employment is still down 10% from pre-pandemic levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| Building prices were up nearly 16%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1150)|
| 0:19:13| Supply chain, garage doors, they can't get the supplies to finish homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1153)|
| 0:19:19| And so we have a record low number of houses being completed as well relative to the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| And then inflation is an increasing concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| New construction is predominantly a debt-financed industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| So as we see interest rates go up, that's going to be a big issue for new home production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| This shows, so just looking at building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| So building permits aren't exactly how many houses we produce, but it's a good proxy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| So following the 2008 financial crisis, if you look from 2010 to 2020, the extent of under-building is really substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1188)|
| 0:19:59| So if you just look at the historical average, don't take into account the fact that we've seen thousands of people move to Knoxville since the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1199)|
| 0:20:09| But just from that last decade, we've under-built 17,000 housing units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| And that number is a really conservative estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1214)|
| 0:20:18| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| In housing completions, we saw permits rise in the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| But we're really only half recovered to what we were seeing in the lead-up to 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| And we were hard to believe, actually, we were under-producing at that period of time as well, except housing was a bit more available to people because of the subprime lending ordeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1231)|
| 0:20:45| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| And this is showing that not only are we under-producing housing, we're systematically under-producing housing that's attainable to first-time homebuyers, to low-income homebuyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1247)|
| 0:20:57| The share of new construction is increasingly more expensive and only attainable to people who are selling their house and trying to move up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1257)|
| 0:21:07| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| And a big part of that is rising land costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| We're running out of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| I don't think that's new to anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1277)|
| 0:21:20| But this is substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| So this graph is showing you between 2012 and 2020 the average percent of your home's value that's attributable just to the land underneath if it didn't have a house on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1281)|
| 0:21:34| So it was 22% back in 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| 2020, 41%, and that number's probably continuing to rise as it has over the last decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1297)|
| 0:21:46| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1306)|
| 0:21:49| So what's driving the demand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| So number one, new pandemic preferences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| People are looking for new home offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| We've seen a really huge rise in people moving to East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| Low but, I'll bet, rising interest rates in the last couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| And then favorable demographics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1326)|
| 0:22:07| You've got a lot of baby boomers nearing retirement, millennials who have a family now and who are moving up to new housing, and millennials hitting the market for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1327)|
| 0:22:17| And then a pretty sustained rise in the number of sole-person households, which is really projected to have a really substantial and enduring impact on housing demand in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1337)|
| 0:22:29| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| One piece that's not necessarily driving demand that I like to highlight is that the share of investor purchases hasn't increased very substantially in the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1352)|
| 0:22:44| You can see up from 9% in 2020 to 11% in 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| We've certainly seen a rise in people using cash, but that's really indicative of people coming to Knoxville with cash, and they're not necessarily investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1370)|
| 0:22:59| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| And this just illustrates the growth in migration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| That's some hard data from the Postal Service showing you that we really have seen a sustained growth in people moving here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1384)|
| 0:23:11| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| So what should we expect moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| As interest rates rise, we have a lot of historical data to suggest that home sales might slow down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| That's probably going to happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| Home price growth is likely to moderate in 2022, but our latest projections see that it's going to continue growing by double digits just as a fact of supply and demand and our supply being so incredibly low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1407)|
| 0:23:42| As a result, affordability is likely to continue to erode, and we don't believe that inventory is going to reach pre-pandemic levels for many, many years, likely more than a decade at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1422)|
| 0:23:55| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| This is showing you your forecast for home prices in 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| This forecast was done in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| I just updated it right before this presentation, which is we're expecting double digits, lower teens for price growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1445)|
| 0:24:14| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1454)|
| 0:24:16| This is showing you effective rent change in the forecast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1456)|
| 0:24:21| We're really expecting another full year of low to high teen growth, and then we're likely to see growth even into 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1461)|
| 0:24:33| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Some policy considerations that you can read more about in the full report in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1475)|
| 0:24:40| Really, these are the two main ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| One is a green tape program that we've seen across the United States in some different municipalities and counties where we create an expedited review process specifically for desirable proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1483)|
| 0:24:56| Research shows that about 30% of the cost of a new home is regulatory costs, costs from holding land, permitting fees, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1496)|
| 0:25:09| Secondly, another sort of expedited review program that we could consider is creating a course for architects and engineers to get certified in all of the regulations that we have in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1509)|
| 0:25:23| So when they submit a plan, we know that it complies in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| So creating an expedited review process specifically for people who have gone through a certification process of having preexisting knowledges of all of the design standards and zoning standards that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1529)|
| 0:25:42| And lastly, building more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| You can go back to the, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| And then this last, I'm going to skip the last two and just spend my last minute on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| Building more homes where people want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1554)|
| 0:25:56| The biggest issue that we have in Knox County is that where housing is most needed is exactly where it's most opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1556)|
| 0:26:05| And we feel really that it's an incredible, that preserving affordability in this county is going to require the political will to make tough decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1565)|
| 0:26:17| And people show up to zoning meetings and we hear the same thing over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| And this isn't blanketly true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| There's different circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| But, you know, it's always going to be pressure on schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| It's always going to be pressure on infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| But if we keep not listening to the need for housing that we're seeing in survey data and affordability data, we will not have the housing stock to house a growing workforce that could come at the cost of future economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1593)|
| 0:26:49| So that is one issue that we feel very passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1609)|
| 0:26:55| So happy to answer any questions if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| And if you have any questions about the longer report, it's a whopping 30-something pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| So I hope you enjoy reading it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| Thank you, Mr. Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1627)|
| 0:27:08| I believe Commissioner Jay has a question and then Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| Mr. Sale, excellent work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| I think your predecessor, Ms. Roche, and I started years ago thinking about this idea, and you've definitely turned it into a really spectacular piece of information that will help us think through, you know, the growing needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1636)|
| 0:27:33| So I appreciate the work put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| I'm excited to read through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Last year when you gave this housing report, I think you said we were about 18,000 units behind, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1659)|
| 0:27:46| Did you quantify a number this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| It may be in here, but I haven't found it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Yes, we were a little bit above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| We were around 3,000-ish building permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| As far as completions, that data is not readily available right now, but it's likely substantially lower than the permitted amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1682)|
| 0:28:11| So, you know, really we're just at the historical average, and to make up for this gap, we have to build over the historical average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1691)|
| 0:28:21| And we weren't even close to building above the historical average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| But, you know, this is not – I'm a big fan of the home builders, and they're facing challenges across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| So, you know, it's going to take a – particularly on the regulatory and development side of our processes to make this easier because we really – we just aren't able to build the housing that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1712)|
| 0:28:45| Well, one thing at the end of your presentation that stood out to me is, if I'm summarizing it correctly, you said our workforce will be stunted, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1725)|
| 0:28:57| It will be difficult to build the workforce necessary to support the jobs, the industries moving here, the companies growing here, if we don't have housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1737)|
| 0:29:06| This is one of those direct relational things that I think we don't often think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| It's not just about land use and property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| It's – we can't say keep bringing more jobs here and keep expanding here if we don't have a place for them to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| It just doesn't equate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| Did I summarize that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| I mean I think we have a great example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Smith & Wesson was considering Knox County, and the number one reason that they didn't pick Knox County was because we didn't have the housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| I mean I don't know if I was supposed to say that publicly, but it's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1774)|
| 0:29:38| I mean that's what companies –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| It is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| When companies are coming here, I mean really if we underinvest in our housing stock, it comes at the cost of what we can – whether we can continue to grow economically in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1781)|
| 0:29:52| I mean there won't be more Amazon distribution centers or investments from these big companies if we don't have any sort of housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1792)|
| 0:30:00| I mean we all sort of have some distaste for how some other countries where affordability has declined – or not countries, counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1800)|
| 0:30:10| Like take Nashville, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| They are rapidly unaffordable, and we brand ourselves as an affordable place to live, but it's not just inherently true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1812)|
| 0:30:21| It's a policy decision, and we haven't gotten there yet from what the data suggests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| My last question touches exactly on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| If you could sort of pick one policy – I mean we come here every month, and we battle over the land that is available versus the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1831)|
| 0:30:40| and oftentimes we keep saying we need more density, we need more housing, but then we end up sort of stuck in this three-and-a-half-unit acre sprawl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1840)|
| 0:30:50| If you could pick one or two policies that this body could adopt that would significantly change our trajectory of housing and workforce development, what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1850)|
| 0:31:02| That's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| I think the expedited permit process and the green tape program is something I feel very passionate about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| It's worked wonders in a lot of other places, so I think that's a really big part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1870)|
| 0:31:15| And then I think finding ways to diversify – developing a light-touch density or missing middle housing plan that specifically sets out a plan of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1875)|
| 0:31:24| here's how we're going to diversify our housing stock, here's how we're going to develop a neighborhood that looks like a single-family neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1884)|
| 0:31:31| but has homes that look like single-family homes that have two units in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1891)|
| 0:31:37| We talk about North Shore Town Center as a great example of something we've done really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| but it took two bankruptcies to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| That's how hard it is to do that sort of thing in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| and so I think developing a plan specifically for how do we enable this type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1910)|
| 0:31:57| because we talk about land conservation, but one unit per acre is probably the best way to take up about as much land as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1917)|
| 0:32:12| Those two things, I feel, are primary among the things we should be talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1932)|
| 0:32:18| Well, I thank you for the candid answers, and I hope you'll share this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1938)|
| 0:32:24| I know you've sent it to us. I hope you'll share this very publicly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1944)|
| 0:32:27| and I hope you'll also share it with our mayor and our team as part of –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| we're right in the discussion of our next phase of growth and what our policies look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| and how we're going to shape our community. I think this is great data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| So thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1962)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Mr. Stelz, thank you for being here, and thank you for the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| Commissioner Jay really, I think, hit everything I was going to talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| but I wanted to make sure and point out to everyone that we feel like we're growing and building at an incredible rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1974)|
| 0:33:01| yet we still haven't touched 2008 yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| And something happened not only here but nationwide with the housing shock of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| After that shock, people were afraid to invest again in an already low-housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1990)|
| 0:33:18| So I guess I just wanted to point out that although it feels like we're going Mad Hatter here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| we're still not even close to where we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| Also, I wanted to touch on density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| I know everybody hates that word, but diversified density type of housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| These companies come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| You know, Commissioner Jay, one of our problems is we're not able to retain the graduates from UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| A lot of that has to do with housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2025)|
| 0:33:48| We have to have things that fit their mode, their lifestyle that they want in order to keep them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| But thank you for this report. It's really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Awesome. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Thank you, Mr. Stelz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2040)|

| 0:37:47| Second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| Is there any discussion of this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| Mr. Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2274)|
| 0:37:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| I want to give the opportunity for our Community Development Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2278)|
| 0:38:04| our Health Department, and then our ambulance provider to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2284)|
| 0:38:10| give us kind of an overview of this whole transition period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2290)|
| 0:38:17| and what exactly this entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| Good evening. Kevin Partin, Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| So, as you all know, both the health care system as well as the EMS system is very strained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2307)|
| 0:38:35| What we have seen over the past several months is basically an unprecedented delay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2315)|
| 0:38:42| in our emergency departments locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Some of this is causing a downstream effect on response times with our local emergency providers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| and we're reaching extremely large fines through the contract process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2335)|
| 0:39:04| when we go through our monthly compliance meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2344)|
| 0:39:07| Josh Spencer reached out requesting some relief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| working with not only AMR, GMR, our hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| Mr. Van de Veet, the mayor's office, tried to come up with a framework| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| that not only protected the county and its citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| but also did provide some relief in some circumstances that were beyond their control, we feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| So, the basic layout of the exemption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Knox County currently has five adult EDs and one pediatric ED.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2374)|
| 0:39:41| In the event that three of the five of those emergency departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| are reported as to be critical or advisory status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| meaning that when an ambulance arrives, they will be held there for one hour plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2389)|
| 0:39:57| and AMR still has the contractual three available ambulances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| we will allow them an exemption to that particular instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| If there is a hospital that would be what we call green or in a normal status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| they have to give the patient the availability to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| The patient can deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| They can say they would prefer to go to whichever one that they are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| They would notate that inside the patient record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2426)|
| 0:40:29| We would review that in compliance and allow them that exemption as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2429)|
| 0:40:36| You obviously spent, you and your team spent a lot of time going through each one of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Do you kind of want to give us an idea how much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| Sure. In the December compliance meeting, the original fine amount was going to be $454,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2445)|
| 0:40:53| And in January, that jumped up to $769,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| With relief, that December number would come down to $248,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2460)|
| 0:41:09| and January's would be $88,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| Total relief would be $887,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| And that would extend through February, March, into April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you, Mr. Parton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2484)|
| 0:41:31| Sure. Mr. VanDebate wanted me to point out that this came about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| because the Governor's Executive Order State of Emergency had expired and has not been renewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| Thank you, Mr. Parton. Commissioner Schumacher, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| So you and your team are comfortable with the revised figures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2512)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| When I looked into discussing this issue, I did ask Mr. VanDebate to pull| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2515)|
| 0:42:01| sort of historical penalty data for the last three years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2521)|
| 0:42:05| just to see kind of what normal years look like prior to the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2525)|
| 0:42:10| And in fiscal 17, 7,000 in penalties, fiscal 18 was about $9,600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2530)|
| 0:42:19| Fiscal 19 was $23,000 and fiscal 20 was $18,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| So all were within, you know, under $25,000 for the last four historical years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| So obviously, you know, looking at that, it seems the data just proves that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| the pandemic exacerbation of the amount of health care and hospitals backed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and all that's gone on with COVID is definitely an anomaly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| So I'll be happy to share that with the rest of the commission as well. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Commissioner Schumacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Thank you. I wanted to just, we had some representatives from AMR here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I did have just a follow-up question to them based on a correspondence we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2580)|
| 0:43:05| all of us received this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Certainly. I believe we have someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Every commissioner received a email from a citizen who just happens to be in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2591)|
| 0:43:17| about an incident that occurred on Saturday afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| And so I wanted to give AMR a chance to brief all of us at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| Sure. I appreciate that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2606)|
| 0:43:28| I'm Brett Jovanovich. I'm the regional vice president for AMR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| Appreciate the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| Unfortunately, Josh Spencer, who's our regional director and very close to the issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2615)|
| 0:43:39| literally just got called away on a family emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| And so he stepped away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| I do know prior to coming to this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| Josh and the local team did dissect that call and did provide written follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2627)|
| 0:43:52| to all of the commissioners and staff specifically related to those events from Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2632)|
| 0:43:58| So I have not had a chance to digest the information myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2638)|
| 0:44:03| Josh had planned to be here, but there is written correspondence on the exact events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| and the root cause to the situation on Saturday in your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2648)|
| 0:44:14| Will somebody, we will be responding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| but will somebody be responding from AMR to the citizen in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| or...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| We will. Yes, sir. We will be following up directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Thank you, sir. Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair. I've got a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| At my age, I'm visiting a lot of people in hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| And so I was out at UT two weeks ago visiting some person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| and it was late in the afternoon, and there were like five ambulances sitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| I don't think they were all AMR, but they were strapped up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| basically the same, just sitting there up away from the emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| A few days later, I was at Fort Sanders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| and I saw a backup of an ambulance just sitting there at the hospitals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| Is that one of the problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2701)|
| 0:45:02| The hospitals are not processing these fast enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| Yes, sir. I think that's the root of the cause that I believe the public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2706)|
| 0:45:14| or public health director communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Part of the challenge is due to staffing and other limitations at the local hospitals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| oftentimes patients don't get offloaded in a very timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| which creates a backlog in getting ambulances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| and other resources back into service to respond to calls in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| But it's not uncommon to have multiple ambulances waiting to offload their patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2738)|
| 0:45:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. Any further discussion, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| We have a motion to move this forward with no recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| with a second by Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| That item moves forward. Thank you very much, gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2757)|

| 0:46:01| Item 36 is Resolution 803.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| It's authorizing a third amendment to the development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| between Knox County and BNA Associates LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| relating to the Andrew Johnson Building to extend the closing date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| Thank you, Madam Clerk. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2777)|

| 0:46:24| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Did Commissioner pull this off for a particular reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| I pulled this at the beginning because there were some questions that have since been answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| Okay, so finance doesn't need to weigh in at all then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| My questions have been answered since I pulled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2801)|
| 0:46:43| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| That item passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| Item 40 is Ordinance O-22-3-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2811)|
| 0:46:56| It's amending Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Sheriff, Division 1, generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2816)|
| 0:47:02| to add a new Section 42-31 entitled Annual Salary Increases for Sworn Officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| to require a minimum 2.5% annual salary increase for sworn officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| regularly employed by the Sheriff's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| who have attained the rank of Captain or below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| This amends Knox County Code, Chapter 42, Article 2, Division 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2841)|
| 0:47:26| adding Section 42-31 previously reserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| This is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2856)|
| 0:47:38| Or move forward with that recommendation at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| I have a motion to move this forward with that recommendation by Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| Second by Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Commissioner Ward, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2869)|
| 0:47:50| Commissioner Biggs isn't here today, so I'll lead off on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| Commissioner Biggs invited me to a Sunshine meeting about a week or so ago with this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2874)|
| 0:48:02| We had a good, lively discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| We had some officers that were able to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| We had a good discussion with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| I had a couple of opinions or things that I wanted to see and hear that aren't currently in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| Mr. Caldwell, are you here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| The main thing I said to Commissioner Biggs is I don't want to get us into a financial pinch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| when, God forbid, we have a bad year or a loss that we're still trying to recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2908)|
| 0:48:35| and also trying to pay this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| Ideally, Mr. Caldwell, if you could answer a couple of questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2919)|
| 0:48:43| Would this, in theory, be coming out of the General Fund in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2923)|
| 0:48:49| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2930)|
| 0:48:51| Chris Caldwell, Finance Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Coming out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| All their pay is paid out of the General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| My thought, and I welcome the discussion on this, is if we are going to go forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| I do want to try to help out our officers and also try to make us a little more competitive with the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2944)|
| 0:49:12| But I do think we need some kind of financial mechanism, a threshold we need to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2952)|
| 0:49:18| before we can financially be able to afford this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| So, my idea was percent of revenue gained to the General Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2963)|
| 0:49:30| Do you understand what I'm saying, Mr. Caldwell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| If the General Fund increased by a certain amount every year to be able to afford this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2972)|
| 0:49:37| I think, so, if I'm wrong, stop me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| And then we can work with Law Director Buch and Jill to try to incorporate these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| But I think what I'm hearing you're saying is wanting to make sure that we've not had a bad year due to an economic downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2987)|
| 0:49:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2995)|
| 0:49:56| So, maybe going back to the previous year's annual report to make sure that there's revenue growth in the General Fund to support said increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=2996)|
| 0:50:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| I know I'm kind of putting you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| Could you either find me what that percentage is or talk to Jill and the Law Director about what that percentage would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3009)|
| 0:50:15| I can work with them and they can make sure that you're comfortable with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| My mindset would be General Fund's about $200 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| So, we said that this had a cost of about $1.2 million a year that would kind of go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3024)|
| 0:50:32| So, you know, you may would want a 1.5 or a 2.5 percent rate increase every year in that revenue line item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3032)|
| 0:50:43| because you're going to have other costs to consider as well, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| So, I think that's something to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| We also have other employees we also would like to get raises to on those good years as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Not just officers, of course, but we also have other employees we're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| I don't want to put us in a financial pinch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| I would say this, and before this even gets asked, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| So, a percent raise for what was given for the sheriff, which is Captain Enbelow, is about $400,000 per percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3064)|
| 0:51:13| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| The other general county employees are about $900,000 per percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3074)|
| 0:51:20| So, because if you combine them, it's about $1.3 million per percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| So, that's broken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| Other than that, I do think, you know, that needs to be added to this to make this a little bit more palatable for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3088)|
| 0:51:34| Like, definitely want to give these guys a raise, but also want to be able, like, our first job is to be financially responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3094)|
| 0:51:40| and be good shepherds of, you know, county dollars and taxpayer dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| So, that's the one thing for this that I would like to see this before next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| Just, I had a conversation with Commissioner Ward today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| Do you want to touch on S&P and Moody's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| Yes, if you check with them and with our creditors to make sure we don't get a hit anywhere on that front as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| So, what he asked me today was, would this have an impact on our bond rating, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| Because they don't like when you're locked into a long-term liability over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| And so, what I told him I would do, and I told him he probably wanted to bring it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| because it may need to be put also in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| We'll look to Director Buch and Jill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3145)|
| 0:52:30| I'll talk to S&P and Moody's to say, you know, this is an ordinance the commission is considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| How would you react if this was adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3158)|
| 0:52:42| And just see what they say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| I think that's it for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3168)|
| 0:52:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3170)|
| 0:52:51| Mr. Koldo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| I'm looking at the fiscal note that's on our online agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| It says approximately $1.2 million in the next fiscal year, and then more in subsequent years thereafter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| Does that include the benefit expense that would go along with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| So, I think here's the key with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| That would include withholdings and our federal taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3195)|
| 0:53:21| It does include increases that kind of go along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3201)|
| 0:53:28| Because you're going to have some ebbs and flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3208)|
| 0:53:29| You're going to have some higher paid employees retire and bring it back on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| Does it include the pension and retirement needed to support that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| So, that is the key on the pension piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| and this is what I think we can discuss over the next two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| You're on pension board, so you know this, but I'll say it for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| Anytime officers get a raise above 3%, that is more than what was calculated into the pension cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3230)|
| 0:54:00| So, what that does is it drives up our actuarially required contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3240)|
| 0:54:08| I'll give you an example, and you're bringing this up, so it's a good time to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3248)|
| 0:54:13| We had really good returns last year, right, in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| 28% returns on UOP is what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3256)|
| 0:54:21| Is that right? I think it's 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| It's 28.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| Even though 3% is built in, there are years that the market doesn't return, and we have to make that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3267)|
| 0:54:33| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| To your point, so 28% returns last year, but officers got above a 3% raise, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3275)|
| 0:54:41| So, our first estimate on what UOP costs are going to do this year for this required contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3281)|
| 0:54:50| is going from 7.4 to 8.1 or 8.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| So, it's a $700,000 to $800,000 increase in UOP cost, and it's driven by two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3295)|
| 0:55:01| It's driven by increased salaries, but it's also driven by officers leaving earlier than we anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3301)|
| 0:55:09| And so, to your point, if officers got a 2.5% raise every year, their pension cost wouldn't change much, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3309)|
| 0:55:22| But if this is a floor, this is 2.5 floor, and they get on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| any time you go above 3%, then that has the ability to impact and increase our pension cost year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| Thank you for breaking that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3336)|
| 0:55:40| Can you also, and this may be something you need to send us, and I believe you provided some of this before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3340)|
| 0:55:47| is a historical breakdown of raises for the same outlined officers over the last 10 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| because I don't think that there's been a year where we've been 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| It's been higher in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| I don't know if it's every year, but it's been in many cases, and I guess one of my worries is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3362)|
| 0:56:07| what if we, if you set a floor, then you may have a mayor and a commission that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| great, you hit the floor, there you go, that's your rate, and no higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| But we've been historically higher, so are we lowering the bar by doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3376)|
| 0:56:22| And then if we hit above 3%, it's not going to be $1.2 million, it's going to be $2 or $3 or $4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| and that is a, the pension side of this may be a huge swing that we're not yet prepared for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| I just want to make sure we outline this in real detail before moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| So I think your point is well made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3398)|
| 0:56:42| So I can provide you the raised history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| So let me give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| Not the bonuses and the, like the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| So the bonuses are important, too, because as of now, bonuses are pensionable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| Yeah, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3416)|
| 0:56:57| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| So this year the officers have received three bonuses that are pensionable that has an impact on our pension cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3418)|
| 0:57:06| And so it's important that we probably do include those, just to give you a clear picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3426)|
| 0:57:12| because if that's included in their highest two years of pay, then that goes into their calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| I just think as we look at the fiscal note, we ought to make sure we understand the full cost weight of this long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3438)|
| 0:57:24| And so if you consider a bonus and you break it out as a percentage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| then I'd say the last three to four years it's been greater than 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Commissioner Durrett and then Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3459)|
| 0:57:41| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| Director Caldwell, we've been talking about the salary survey for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3463)|
| 0:57:49| Has any of that come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3469)|
| 0:57:51| Do we have any results from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3471)|
| 0:57:52| Do we know where that stands at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| I talked to Allison Rogers last week, and I think it's still not in yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3475)|
| 0:58:03| And so I'm not for sure when they expect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| but I think they were making some tweaks to it and some changes and the final drafts not came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| Once they get it, I'm sure they're going to share it with us and we can share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3492)|
| 0:58:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3495)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| Thank you, Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3498)|
| 0:58:19| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3500)|
| 0:58:22| Yeah, I had a question about the salary suit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3502)|
| 0:58:26| Since we're paying an outside vendor to go through that process for us and we don't have the answers yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3506)|
| 0:58:34| are we not putting the cart before the horse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| I think that's a decision for you all to make, and, you know, you have two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| The sheriff may be able to tell us when they may anticipate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3526)|
| 0:58:52| but I think you may want to see, I can see why you would want to see that survey before you make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3532)|
| 0:59:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| And then in past conversations, we've heard that it's been very difficult to get new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3543)|
| 0:59:12| How are we addressing new hires with the sheriff's department if we're doing a pay scale that's captains on down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3552)|
| 0:59:25| And I guess that question would be for the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3565)|
| 0:59:30| Justin wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| Justin wrote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| I'm supporting him in the effort of it, but I don't know the exact details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| But when we had the discussion two weeks ago, his train of thought at the time was because the city has a 2.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3579)|
| 0:59:47| this would help us compete against the city when it comes to hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3587)|
| 0:59:52| We can say, hey, you know, you should get at least a 2.5% every year, if not more, if we have extra, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| like last year we did five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| But that was kind of his thought process at the time when we had the discussion two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3600)|
| 1:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| Sheriff, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| Obviously the mayor has been up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3613)|
| 1:00:15| This thing is all the way up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| You can't even see me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| So with that being addressed, Commissioner, I think when we put it for the captains below,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| when people come into this agency, they're not starting out as a captain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| So they start out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| And the way we look at it is our higher rank people are now making that good money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| It's our people, boots on the ground, if you will, that we're wanting to take care of and help recruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| And I think that's going to help recruiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| This would be a step definitely in the right direction with having that annual step increase, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| And I heard you talking about the survey as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| We're still waiting to hear back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| We thought we would have that thing back by January, but we're still anxiously awaiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| We have emailed two or three different times, so we're still waiting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| But I will tell you this, what you're going to see, there's no doubt in my mind, is that we're still lagging behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| So how we fix it will be a long-term issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3670)|
| 1:01:13| but there are some of the things that we want to fix immediately to be able to recruit and retain as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| Okay, but if there was a pot of money available to your department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3680)|
| 1:01:27| would we want to address new hires first before doing the existing employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3687)|
| 1:01:36| I think what you fix is you fix the new hires, which that would be the important first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3696)|
| 1:01:44| But I think we've got to also look at taking care of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| and fixing the ones who have been there for a certain period of time, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3707)|
| 1:01:54| Let me ask you, is it the captain part, or do you want it to be like sergeant and below?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3714)|
| 1:01:59| Well, I mean, we always hear this over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| It's always been captains, and I'm like, well, if you have X number of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| it's the sergeants and below that probably are not on the same level as the lieutenants and the captains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| And so that's why I was looking at that, because obviously a county budget, we don't have unlimited funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3735)|
| 1:02:23| I'd be fine with it being sergeant and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| Well, and I think what we're looking at is our chiefs, those salaries are already up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3745)|
| 1:02:30| We don't need to be increasing theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Obviously, if they get just like a county employee raise each year, then that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3752)|
| 1:02:37| But we don't look as to moving them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3757)|
| 1:02:41| I don't think that those individuals, they're not out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| The captains are out there on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| We have captains that are out there on the street doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| So that's why we cap it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3767)|
| 1:02:52| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3772)|
| 1:02:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3773)|
| 1:02:55| Thank you, Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| And then back to Commissioner, well, actually, Commissioner Jay, have you spoken on this yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3778)|
| 1:03:02| I have, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| Okay. Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Sheriff, could you tell me as of today what percentage we're looking at that we would have to offer to make us even with the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3787)|
| 1:03:25| Well, if they go and get the raise that is being addressed right now at, what, 6%, I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| then obviously for us to be equivalent with them, it's going to have to be a little more than 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3813)|
| 1:03:38| And I say that because we're already behind them right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| So you're probably looking at anywhere from 7% to 8% just to be equivalent with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3827)|
| 1:03:49| Although I understand they're having a problem recruiting also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| It's not just locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| It's nationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| And I think you go to any business right now today and you see we're hiring signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| So we're not alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3843)|
| 1:04:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| And I know there's nobody sitting up here that doesn't want to get our officers more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3847)|
| 1:04:14| And I know that you all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| And I know with the work that Commissioner Ward and Biggs are working on this, it shows that this commission does care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| And I'm grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| I do share Commissioner Ward's concerns about our first priority is to be fiscally responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3864)|
| 1:04:35| This, I guess, might be more for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| Is there some advantage to perhaps instead of guaranteeing a percentage each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3879)|
| 1:04:51| I really like Commissioner Ward's tying it to some amount of percent that we increase our own revenues beyond cost of living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3891)|
| 1:05:05| But as opposed to paying bonuses, looking at year-end numbers and much as we've done from time to time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3905)|
| 1:05:18| and instead of putting us on the hook for X number of dollars every year, and that grows and grows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3918)|
| 1:05:29| which I don't deny it doesn't need to happen, but looking at instead percentage that we've got left in the pot, so to speak, at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3929)|
| 1:05:42| I know bonuses are hugely popular with a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3942)|
| 1:05:48| But I've heard several sheriff's deputies saying that's like Christmas in July kind of deal and very much appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3948)|
| 1:05:57| He's trying to look at the best way to protect us, but give them the money that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3957)|
| 1:06:01| Agreed. And so one thing, I'm going to cover a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| So I do think that bonuses are a good way to look at things in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3965)|
| 1:06:12| So the sheriff's office has struggled this year, so they have a lot of salary money left because they have like 150 vacancies that they can't fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3972)|
| 1:06:25| So if you're the sheriff, what you want to do is you don't want to give up those positions because you don't want to eventually be able to hire them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3985)|
| 1:06:34| So he came up and had a conversation with the mayor, and through the course of this fiscal year, there was a $750 bonus in October, I believe, and a $3,000 bonus in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=3994)|
| 1:06:50| And so that's some things that we have done to try to help with the retention of officers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4010)|
| 1:06:56| And there was also another $750 bonus that was from the budget last year that was done in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| So if you take that, you know, that's $4,500 worth of bonuses, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| And currently that is pensionable, and so unfortunately that drives up that pension cost that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4030)|
| 1:07:18| So one thing that we have talked about is does it make sense to look to adopt some sort of bonus structure that may be non-pensionable, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4038)|
| 1:07:34| And so that could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| We should do it across all plans if we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| I can give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| Our general county employees, when we give out the bonuses like we did Thanksgiving, as you mentioned, they seem to prefer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4066)|
| 1:07:55| Oftentimes what they'll come up to me and say is, do you have to take out my 401k match on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| We do currently, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| And so, you know, if you're stingy like me, you're happy to get that 401k match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4084)|
| 1:08:12| I saw that, Luke Ritchie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| And so I think that's just things that we have to consider because currently when we give bonuses, I think it helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4094)|
| 1:08:22| And so if you're the sheriff and you're looking at your starting pay, if you include these bonuses, then it helps to get it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4102)|
| 1:08:30| The problem is, and his argument would be, a bonus is not a recurring thing, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| Now, if the vacancies continue, they can be a recurring thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4116)|
| 1:08:41| But I think it's just how you treat them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4121)|
| 1:08:44| And so I think bonuses is a good way to do things from the standpoint that if you're having a good fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4124)|
| 1:08:51| and you're going to have a budget exceed expenditures, then you look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4131)|
| 1:08:55| Or if there are vacancies and your revenues are still high, it's a good thing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4135)|
| 1:09:03| This is for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| If we were to pass this resolution, what does that hold for future commission boards as far as enforcement or doing away with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4147)|
| 1:09:25| Is this like for all eternity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| Well, it would be until you change the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4169)|
| 1:09:32| If you did this five years down the road and you wanted to rescind the ordinance, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4172)|
| 1:09:39| Commissioner, to explain this a little bit, Commissioner Biggs came to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| He wanted basically, without anything else, to copy what the city had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4184)|
| 1:09:51| And the city has their ordinance 2-459, which is the one that guarantees the 2.5 percent per year per uniformed officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4191)|
| 1:10:01| And that's the way Jill tried to draft this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| It was a long, hard job to draft this this way because if you get above step and grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4204)|
| 1:10:10| then you've got to treat it as a bonus coming at the end because you can't change the step and grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4210)|
| 1:10:16| which the sheriff and all Knox County employees are under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4216)|
| 1:10:19| And I think that Commissioner Ward is the one that brought up the issue going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| It's got to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| And one of those is what does it do to our bond rating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4227)|
| 1:10:31| Bonding companies, as Chris pointed out, do not like to be tied into something in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4231)|
| 1:10:40| And those are things that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| And we will be, however Chris comes up with the numbers, we'll be running them by Kyle and Justin and the rest of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4243)|
| 1:10:50| before you get a final version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| But this basically was what Justin Biggs wanted, which was, and we tried to do it as best we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4252)|
| 1:10:59| Section 2.459 of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4259)|
| 1:11:07| That's not a very complete answer because we've got to, in our system, unlike the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| we have, as you all know, we have salary suits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4273)|
| 1:11:17| The sheriff has to submit a salary suit every year in which, if you've ever seen one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| he goes through every, not by names, but by number, of what salary was this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| and what he's going to be next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| And that is filed in Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4291)|
| 1:11:34| And it's either agreed to by the executive branch of government, the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| in which case if it is, it goes down as an order and it's a binding order of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4301)|
| 1:11:46| I've never seen a mayor turn down a, certainly not this mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4306)|
| 1:11:51| never turned down any request that the sheriff has made in a salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| But we've got to go through that anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| But if the ordinance says 2.5 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| then the sheriff would be putting that into a salary suit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4322)|
| 1:12:06| and it would go on up to the mayor and then on to this body for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| It's complicated, but that's about the best way I can explain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4330)|
| 1:12:16| I just suggest that that locked-in amount, as we all know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| is not working real well for the city at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| And that is certainly something to, I think, take under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| And also some concerns about just equity in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4350)|
| 1:12:37| I would imagine that we probably have other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| that are not maybe making the type of money they should be, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| So when our next group approaches us about wanting this same type of benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4367)|
| 1:12:56| I mean, what are we going to do with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4376)|
| 1:13:00| So I'm just trying to consider all options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| Not that we, again, we want to get you as much money as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| but to be smart, just to be smart about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4390)|
| 1:13:16| Thank you, Mr. Hill. Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| I think I have questions for the sheriff and for Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| I know we're talking about ordinances and pay raises here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4403)|
| 1:13:26| but we've touched on several subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| I'm fine with paying bonuses out of vacant position money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4408)|
| 1:13:32| but I'm not a big fan of bonuses as a salary compensation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| Bonuses are a little bit like Halloween candy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| One week later, you need more candy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I prefer raises that give you accumulating growing wealth year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4423)|
| 1:13:49| Question for you is if I were a young man| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| and I wanted to come work for the sheriff's department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| it's my understanding I would go to the correction facility first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4436)|
| 1:14:03| That's correct, unless you're a certified officer from another state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4443)|
| 1:14:07| or somewhere else, then we're doing laterals as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4447)|
| 1:14:11| How long does one typically have to be at the correction facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4451)|
| 1:14:14| before they make patrol?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Usually it's a minimum of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| What percentage of our people do we lose in that year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4460)|
| 1:14:25| I couldn't give you a percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| There's several because they find out either during the academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| the corrections academy, it's not what they thought it was going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| And then we find out some whenever they get their assignment that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| well, I can't work that shift, I can't do an evening shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Percentage-wise, I would know where to start with that right offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Okay, and if I went to one of the surrounding counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| would I have to start off in the correction facilities also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| If it's the sheriff's office, yes, for the most part they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| Okay, and their proportion of employees on patrol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| and correction facility are roughly the same as ours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| I mean, proportional-wise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| I guess what I'm getting at is our problem in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4508)|
| 1:15:12| we need to pay the correctional officers more to get them to stay around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Yes, and that's a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| The correctional's job is obviously different than the law enforcement side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4518)|
| 1:15:23| but it doesn't take away the dangers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| It's just as dangerous inside that facility as it is out here on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| Now, it's confined, obviously, but, yeah,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4528)|
| 1:15:34| that's a step, and I think what you saw with the governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| doing what he did with the prisons across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| by the correctional officers, by raising them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| not only did that also affect us as far as corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| but our law enforcement because it makes more than our law enforcement officers do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| and it'll do the same for KPD as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| How many do we have in the correctional facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4555)|
| 1:15:58| With our numbers down right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| we probably have about 375 to 400, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| Okay, and how many patrolmen do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Our certified officers, which would include our detectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4569)|
| 1:16:12| they're all post-certified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| You're probably looking at another 375 to 380, somewhere around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4574)|
| 1:16:19| Okay, so how do you get a year turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| if you've got just as many in the correctional facility as you do patrolling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4581)|
| 1:16:24| It's not patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4584)|
| 1:16:25| You've got detectives, you've got other agents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| you've got other divisions within the law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4587)|
| 1:16:31| And so your corrections usually, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4591)|
| 1:16:34| add the 75 to 80 people that were short in our corrections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| so you're going to be over 400, 450 within corrections where it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4599)|
| 1:16:44| And then our patrol numbers are down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4604)|
| 1:16:47| but not anywhere near what our corrections are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| So you've got detective division, you've got our narcotics division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| All these people can be and have been one time or another either on patrol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| because that's where they normally start out as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| And then as they progress as a detective, then they go up to burglary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| But they start in corrections, and then 90% of them go from corrections to patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| And we've got 300-something in correction and 300-something in patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| I'm wondering how are we losing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| because they get stuck at corrections with nowhere to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4638)|
| 1:17:22| Some do, because some either they just don't make it through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4642)|
| 1:17:29| When I say the process, the physical part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4649)|
| 1:17:31| the testing that they take on the law enforcement side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| either they don't make it there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| or either they just decide that they're not going anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4656)|
| 1:17:39| and they're going to find something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4659)|
| 1:17:41| So not everybody makes it through the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| And we've had people that are in corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| that didn't make it through the law enforcement academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| and had to go back to corrections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| And some of those said, well, I won't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| So, you know, it's just one of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| It's just back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| That's the way it's always been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| When I say it's the way it's always been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4679)|
| 1:18:00| that's the way you either want to work in corrections and stay there as a career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| or either you want to start out in corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| and make your way over to the law enforcement side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Okay. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Commissioner Jay, and then back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| I have a question for the Sheriff's team first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| But, Mr. Caldwell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4703)|
| 1:18:28| there was some discussion about the breakdown of sergeants and below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| versus captains and above and that rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| Obviously, the salary is being much different when it gets to that limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| Would this – there was some discussion or some mention about a normal –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| like the captains above are a normal county raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| Would this be above and beyond a normal county raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| or would this be the raise for all officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| I think the way it reads is, and what the 1.2 was based on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| is a 2.5% raise for captain and below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| But that's – let's say there was a year and that was it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| It made the threshold of financial sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4752)|
| 1:19:15| but there was no 5% or 6% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| It was just 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4757)|
| 1:19:19| But the county gave a regular raise to every other employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| that would not be in addition to a regular employee raise, or would it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| This is not an on-top-of layer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| I think in general, let's assume – just two examples, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| If the general county employee raise was 4%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| I'm assuming that the officers would get 2.5 plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4785)|
| 1:19:51| Plus the 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| Well, plus the 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| I think they would get to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4793)|
| 1:19:55| So they would get 2.5 plus 1.5 to get to 4 to be equal to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4795)|
| 1:20:01| See what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| So this is not necessarily a float on top of the baseline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| that everybody else would get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4804)|
| 1:20:06| That's the way I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| That wasn't the intention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| What Mr. Caldwell described was the original intention we talked about two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| So can you restate what the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| So, like Mr. Caldwell said, if there's a 2.5 base and if we decide on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| because we decide here, as you know, you've been through it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| If we say, all right, we're going to give the officers 5 this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| well, then it's another 2.5% already on the 2.5% that we've already decided on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4828)|
| 1:20:33| It's baked into the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4833)|
| 1:20:34| It's baked into the total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| It doesn't float on top like icing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4835)|
| 1:20:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I just wanted to verify with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| One thing I would just ask of the sheriff's office, before we go forward next week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| obviously this has two readings, but I'd like to have some data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| I think some of the other commissioners would too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| Number of officers, different positions, you know, captains, sergeants, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4851)|
| 1:20:55| How many do we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| What are the salaries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| I mean, like we need some information about –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| I know we have a total aggregate number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| but we really need some baseline information of who are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4862)|
| 1:21:08| How many people are we talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| What are the salary numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| We need a better understanding of it than just the one lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| So I'd just like to request that from our sheriff's team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4878)|
| 1:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4879)|
| 1:21:21| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4883)|
| 1:21:25| Can I defer to my colleague, Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| He wants to make a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4889)|
| 1:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| As Commissioner Jay just said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| I also agree with what Commissioner Schoonmaker said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| I would like to see the survey study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| I don't mind postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| I want to do the right thing here by the officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| but I also don't want to rush this and screw this up at the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| because it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| We're talking about a significant amount of money going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| So I don't want to speak for Commissioner Biggs because I'm not him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| but for me personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4913)|
| 1:21:54| if we have to postpone this to see salaries and salary studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4914)|
| 1:21:58| and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| I think due diligence is definitely warranted in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4919)|
| 1:22:02| So I just wanted to put that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Mr. Law Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4930)|
| 1:22:13| the 2.5% that the city of Knoxville stipulates that they give to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4933)|
| 1:22:25| uniformed officers, and that was done by ordinance according to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4945)|
| 1:22:31| It's my understanding that every city employee gets 2.5% every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4951)|
| 1:22:36| So is this a 2.5% on top of every city employee's 2.5%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4956)|
| 1:22:43| The way I read it, the Section 2-454 says that employees in exempt positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4963)|
| 1:22:51| subject to appointment by the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| and employees in exempt positions in the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| shall get an annual 2.5% salary increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4977)|
| 1:23:04| So you put those together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| I'm not sure whether that applies to all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| The way it reads, I'm talking about their 2.454.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4990)|
| 1:23:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4995)|
| 1:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| And then this is codified in their city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Was this actually voted on by the voters of the city of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| No, no, that's just an ordinance passed by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| And then just one last question for the Sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| When are the salary suits due?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5016)|
| 1:23:45| It's usually when the budget takes effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| so it's usually around July 1st, somewhere around in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| And can I add this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| I promise you as soon as we get this survey in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| you're going to have it in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| We're just as anxious for it as you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| I promise you that because I think when the city did theirs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5043)|
| 1:24:07| it took them close to a year, but they did fire and police together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| So I'm hoping that Evergreen is not taking that long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| but I think I come to this commission back in January and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| I thought we were going to have it in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| Well, I'm still waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5061)|
| 1:24:23| And Ms. Rogers has emailed them twice now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5063)|
| 1:24:27| So hopefully we'll hear something soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| but I want to make sure that you know, as soon as we get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| you're going to have it in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5075)|
| 1:24:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5076)|
| 1:24:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Just one last quick question for the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5078)|
| 1:24:41| If this was codified and this was put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| would it prevent that it would not prevent the sheriff from doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| salary suit and saying, thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| commission for the two and a half percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5091)|
| 1:24:53| I'm going to go file a salary suit for 6% and adjudicating it directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| with the chancellor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| It's got to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5099)|
| 1:25:01| It's got to go through and be approved by the mayor because ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| he's got to approve the budget that he sends down to you all for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5104)|
| 1:25:08| approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5108)|
| 1:25:09| Chris says a minimum of 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| So take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| So if that's a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5113)|
| 1:25:15| then if the sheriff deems it's there and possibly there with natural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5115)|
| 1:25:19| growth and all that, talking with Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5119)|
| 1:25:22| he could certainly put an increase in the salary suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5122)|
| 1:25:28| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| We have a motion before us to move this forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5130)|

| 1:27:06| When I first got this information about this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| the original bill looks nothing like what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5229)|
| 1:27:13| And they added this amendment to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| And I started studying in this thing and I started going over and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| over and I've got a bunch of things from local citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5239)|

| 1:27:27| So I kept studying and trying to find what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| And I had a little conversation this afternoon to make sure that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5250)|
| 1:27:33| was reading and understanding it properly from director book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5253)|

| 1:28:14| We had Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5294)|

| 1:28:31| And so it was going through some neighborhoods in Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| And they filed a local amendment to stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5316)|
| 1:28:37| It went to court and they lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| Because the utilities have the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5322)|

| 1:28:45| And putting their utilities through wherever they want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| And all this amendment does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5329)|
| 1:28:51| Spell out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5331)|

| 1:28:56| And I apologize for putting it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| But I just want to let the people know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| That.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5340)|
| 1:29:01| The utilities already have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5341)|
| 1:29:03| And all that they're doing is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5343)|
| 1:29:05| Just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5345)|

| 1:29:08| Writing it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| And it's kind of like we discussed sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5350)|
| 1:29:13| Our rules committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5353)|
| 1:29:15| Why would we put anything words to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| And all the words do is keep us out of lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5358)|
| 1:29:21| It's what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5361)|
| 1:29:22| That's what they were passing this bill for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| Was to keep them out of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| So I apologize for putting it on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| But I thought somebody ought to be to know about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| What was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| So that's what I found out about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5372)|
| 1:29:35| You might want to discuss anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5375)|

| 1:31:51| Is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5511)|
| 1:31:52| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5512)|
| 1:31:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5514)|
| 1:31:55| I've only planned to talk for maybe 10 or 15 minutes and field any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| We're really looking at this now is unfinished learning and our learning recovery plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5520)|
| 1:32:05| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| We want to move to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| That emerged out of a long needs assessment process during the summer that involved both surveys to all of our families and stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5529)|
| 1:32:19| We reached out to a lot of our nonprofit groups that also serve students to find out what they were seeing and what they felt like were important areas for us to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5539)|
| 1:32:28| And then we held focus groups with teachers, principals and parents and then also had individual meetings with our school board members so that we could hear what the community was sharing with them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5548)|
| 1:32:39| And through that, we identified four priorities that we are focused on from now until we've got some pretty lofty goals from now until 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5559)|
| 1:32:51| So the one I'm going to mostly focus on will be the academic skills, which I think the next slide goes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| We are looking at a two-pronged approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| We have some things that are emergencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5582)|
| 1:33:06| They're work that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| We talk about putting out the fires in the next 12 to 24 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| But we also are tending the garden the next three to five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5591)|
| 1:33:15| How do we make sure that we're better in three to five years than we were prior to the closure in 2020 and the disruption from last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5595)|
| 1:33:24| So keeping that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5604)|
| 1:33:29| So with the ESSER funds that have come into our district, we are keeping this vision front and center, that we are trying to use them strategically so that all students in all of our schools and in all of our groups have access to the continuing support and tools that they need to thrive in grade-level instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5609)|
| 1:33:47| And our goal is really beyond high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5627)|
| 1:33:50| We want them to be able to leave us ready to engage in the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| And so we're having to take a multi-pronged approach to this because our youngest students missed some of their early foundational skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5634)|
| 1:34:01| But our high school students are expected to leave and be able to engage in the workforce or in post-secondary as any other graduate would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5641)|
| 1:34:10| So we're having to look at that across all those different age groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| So just keeping that in mind as we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| I have some data coming up in the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| This gives you some of our trend data that we saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| So we have been holding steady in reading at around the 40 percentile reading on grade-level or advanced, which is fairly consistent across English-speaking countries and the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5664)|
| 1:34:39| The Department of Defense is the highest performing jurisdiction at 52% right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| But we see a fairly significant loss in 2021, and we want to be better than 40% beyond this initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5685)|
| 1:34:55| This is our high school Algebra I data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| So this does not consider the – we have about 1,000 students in eighth grade who take Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5697)|
| 1:35:04| They have about a 60% success rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| But when we look at just our high school students, we were holding steady at about 14%, and that dropped to 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| If we're looking at our students who are economically disadvantaged, we're looking at about 4%, our proficient or advanced in Algebra I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5714)|
| 1:35:21| And Algebra I is the gateway into all the higher math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| So that's a place – these are two areas where we're putting a lot of laser focus for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| And then the next slide shows you kind of a breakdown by demographic for third-grade reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| So you can see that, you know, a lot of our populations were impacted more greatly than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5737)|
| 1:35:43| and we need to make sure we're very strategic about understanding why different groups of students are performing differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| and making sure that we're differentiating our supports to be able to address all of their learning needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| One of the things that we have seen in this is that we test our students for two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5756)|
| 1:36:02| We test them for foundational skills, and we also test them for the ability to perform at grade-level standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5762)|
| 1:36:09| And what we're finding is that we have more students who are needing that foundational support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| and over the last two years, we've been less efficient at recovering those skills than we had in previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| And we see a lot of that had to do with a lot of the students who were in and out for quarantines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| who chose to go in a virtual setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| And so going back and recovering that is an area of focus for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| So the next slide has early post-secondary credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| So these are ones that we know about our advanced placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5798)|
| 1:36:43| It's been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| Cambridge is one that is a possibility for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| International baccalaureate, dual enrollment, industry certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5807)|
| 1:36:51| those are all ways that students can earn credits that give them job opportunities beyond high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5811)|
| 1:36:58| And what you can see here are our different...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| The numbers of credits that we've been able to award over the last several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| and we see a little bit of a dip, but this is something that we are tracking very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| because this accelerates our students into having a meaningful employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| and also making sure our employers have people ready to take on the jobs at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5836)|
| 1:37:23| So then the next slide is getting into the way we've set up our priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5843)|
| 1:37:28| We have set up implementation teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| So in these priorities we probably have, just in the academic priority alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| we have 130 action steps that we're using to address those priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| I just wanted to let you see the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5859)|
| 1:37:41| We meet weekly to update where we are on each of our action steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| and to look at the results and the impact of those action steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5866)|
| 1:37:50| So the next slide is showing the academic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| This is the one where we have 130 action steps that we are implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5874)|
| 1:37:59| In order to focus on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| We're really focusing heavily on K2 foundational skills and the 6.8, the middle school math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| because that is the precursor to Algebra 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5886)|
| 1:38:09| and trying to make sure we have that success rate for graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| So the next slide...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| We can move to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| That's just looking at our flow chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| These are our strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5900)|
| 1:38:21| So we have put in a new curriculum, K through 12, in ELA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5901)|
| 1:38:26| One of the things that we've seen in K5 that has been a significant shift for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| is our EL students now have a curriculum that matches our Tier 1 curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5911)|
| 1:38:38| So when they are pulled out for 60 minutes of support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| their curriculum, it's the same text, it's the same vocabulary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| their teachers have access to the exact same material that the classroom teacher has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5924)|
| 1:38:50| and so the students are really getting a boost in their language development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| Middle grades math, we made a switch in the curriculum there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| and we're putting a lot of support into helping our teachers understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5940)|
| 1:39:03| how that curriculum is laid out, how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5943)|
| 1:39:06| and we're starting to see some very good early indicators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| that our students are really working in math much more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5950)|
| 1:39:15| We've added an assessment to make sure we're identifying learning gaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| We've not had a benchmark assessment in several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| and there is one that many other counties in Tennessee were using,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| and it was showing about 95% predictability on the TCAP test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| So we're using that, we're testing our students three times a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5973)|
| 1:39:37| to see how they're performing and giving us some good information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5977)|
| 1:39:41| on what we might do differently to provide tutoring supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| or other resources to help them recover lost learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5984)|
| 1:39:49| or accelerate where they are right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5989)|
| 1:39:52| And we're using a lot of the information that we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| to differentiate our professional development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| Our teachers are seeing students coming in with a lot of different needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| because they've had different experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6002)|
| 1:40:04| They had some who were virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| They had some who were on multiple quarantines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| And so helping our teachers to know when is it a foundational skill issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| and how do we help with that, or when is it something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| for example, next year in U.S. history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| our 8th graders from the year we closed will be 11th graders next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| They missed the Civil War.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| So helping our teachers to know you're going to have to recover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6028)|
| 1:40:31| the Civil War with your 11th graders next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6031)|
| 1:40:33| and keeping up with what was the content that was missed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| so that they can recover that topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6036)|
| 1:40:41| We're also investing in our current personnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| We did not want to spend a lot of our money on bringing in new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| who, when the money expires in three years, we have to let a lot of people go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| Also, as we've heard in some earlier presentations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| recruiting and retaining talent is something that everybody is struggling with right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| So we thought that it was really important to invest in the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6058)|
| 1:41:01| who are in our buildings and who have a lot of expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| So we are funding for one of our teachers in every elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| is being funded to complete a literacy specialist certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6070)|
| 1:41:15| through the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6075)|
| 1:41:17| They're in a cohort, and they're looking very specifically at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6077)|
| 1:41:21| how do you identify reading difficulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| diagnose why the child is having a reading difficulty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| and what are the appropriate interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| in order to be able to treat that reading difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6090)|
| 1:41:32| And they're functioning as part of that literacy leadership team in their building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6092)|
| 1:41:36| And that's something that we hope can become an ongoing process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| where being part of our county means we're also investing in you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| and your ongoing education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| Heavy emphasis in early intervention and remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| We have a lot of tutoring that we're offering after school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| that is free to the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| All they have to do is sign up and stay at the school for that tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| We are offering the summer learning camps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6116)|
| 1:42:00| And then we're also doing Tennessee all-core tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| So specifically in foundational reading and 6.8 math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| we are trying to hire 216, the equivalent of 216 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| who can tutor in a one-to-three or a one-to-four ratio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| So that's an area where we need help connecting with people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| who maybe have stepped out of the workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| They don't want to work full-time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| They're trying to raise their kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| but they might want to come back in and provide some tutoring support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| And we can pay to have them provide that tutoring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6149)|
| 1:42:34| And we provide all the materials and the training and the support for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Out of that initiative, we are also hoping that we identify some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| who maybe would be interested in becoming math teachers for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| and we have set aside some funds to be able to pay for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6166)|
| 1:42:49| to complete their degree and their certification to become a math teacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6169)|
| 1:42:53| because math teachers are incredibly hard to come by right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| And then we're also looking to reimagine our high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| We've been going through a process with Ford Next Generation Learning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6180)|
| 1:43:05| recognizing that our students, one of the things they missed during the closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6185)|
| 1:43:09| were those opportunities to really have some work-based learning experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| and that got us to really think about how we may need to think about this differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6193)|
| 1:43:17| so all of our students are having some experience in workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| and connecting the work that they're doing in their high school education program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| to their ideas of what they want to do beyond high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| So that's something where we've been in about an 18-month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| looking at with the community, the nonprofit groups, private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6214)|
| 1:43:39| teachers, principals, counselors, around how can we think about high school differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| to give our students those experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| So all of that is coming together to address all of the different learning loss issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| that we have seen and experienced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6232)|
| 1:43:55| and this has been sort of, I guess, a high-level look at some of those strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| that we're engaging in to recover that unfinished learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| Thank you very much, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Commissioner Bussler, you have the floor still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| The reason, Ms. Jackson, I brought this up is not planned where we're going forward now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6254)|
| 1:44:22| but the kids we've missed the last two or three years that have gone down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| and have graduated and going on, we can't catch up with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| We cannot do what we were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6270)|
| 1:44:35| And the percentage, like in math, that turned out, what, 19% achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6275)|
| 1:44:40| something like that, I think Bob Thomas told me this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| and 30% in reading efficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| and these sort of things that we have kind of perpetuated on because of this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6287)|
| 1:44:55| But the learning loss is how are we going to make it up for those kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6295)|
| 1:44:59| that we have just kind of passed on and they're going out in the workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| and they're not prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| We had Mr. Lotus in here, what was it, last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| that gave us a little information on learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6311)|
| 1:45:15| And I made a statement and I asked him again to make sure I heard it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6315)|
| 1:45:20| He said that the university was not putting out students ready for the type jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| that we have in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6325)|
| 1:45:27| And that surprised me also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| So I'm just concerned of how you're going to make up this loss that we've already had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6330)|
| 1:45:37| and how is it going to affect the economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| and are those people going to be a drain on the rest of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| because they don't have the skills to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| And that worries me to no end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| because it's going to take a lot of money to help carry those people on and get them back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| Now you have some kids that's in the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6355)|
| 1:45:58| and this is just my feeling, that learn regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6358)|
| 1:46:01| They learn to read better, they learn, they're a lot quicker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6361)|
| 1:46:07| Do we have a system that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6367)|
| 1:46:11| okay, for these kids that are already learning and progressing on faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| can we not push them on and let them go on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| And then you have another set that doesn't quite learn as fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| but they are fast learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6381)|
| 1:46:23| Do we have a system that can we push them on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6383)|
| 1:46:26| And then the ones that are really needing help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6386)|
| 1:46:29| that don't have the parents at home that does tutoring and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6389)|
| 1:46:33| and make sure their kids are reading and doing their math lessons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| and things like this, those are the kids that really bother me too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| because we've already committed that there are going to be failures probably out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6400)|
| 1:46:46| But we don't, I mean all this sounds great, but we're not making up anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6406)|
| 1:46:52| We're just trying to gain back some ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| And that's what I wanted to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6415)|
| 1:47:01| I mean your plan is good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| but does it address the main problems that we're having right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| Are we going to be back in school like before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| that we have in-person learning to where we can check on kids that are failing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6432)|
| 1:47:16| and we can identify them correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| And how can we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| Are we going to get to a situation that we're going to go back to virtual learning again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| And we just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| And we have not made plans for that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6448)|
| 1:47:32| And we can spend a lot of money, but if we can't help the kids make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| and help be successful in their life when they leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| I don't know how we can ever help them and we perpetuate the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6463)|
| 1:47:53| And we're still in perpetuating the problem now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6473)|
| 1:47:57| I know we've kind of changed our whole attitude about education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| especially in high school and the way we build high schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6481)|
| 1:48:05| and the way we trade things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6485)|
| 1:48:09| And one of the things that I wanted to ask about next time on the buildings is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| we have anywhere from schools that have as few as 70 in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6493)|
| 1:48:18| and as many as 2,060 in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| And I was using old figures because the ones that we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6500)|
| 1:48:24| were just like when we had 60,000 students enrolled in Oxcam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| Now what, we have 58,000-something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6507)|
| 1:48:30| Right around 58,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6510)|
| 1:48:32| Yeah, about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6512)|
| 1:48:33| And we're going to lose money because the way the new BEP is going to go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6513)|
| 1:48:39| it has to deal with per student amount that's going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6519)|
| 1:48:45| But I just want something that you could tell the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6525)|
| 1:48:47| here's what we're doing right now, and we're trying to do it individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| Like you said, how do you get tutors in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| You know, small class tutors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6533)|
| 1:48:55| And then you talked about summer class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6535)|
| 1:48:57| I asked Superintendent Thomas, what about last year when you had summer classes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6537)|
| 1:49:03| He said it was good up through June, but July came,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| everybody went on vacation, they never came back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| You know, when you don't have parents to understand what their kids need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| that's some things that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6554)|
| 1:49:17| And, again, it's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6557)|
| 1:49:19| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6559)|
| 1:49:20| I am not here to beat you over the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6560)|
| 1:49:22| I'm just concerned about those kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6565)|
| 1:49:26| And we've not said anything about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| We've said something about the future, but not about the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| We've already failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| And that's the big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| Could I ask a clarifying question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6577)|
| 1:49:38| When you're talking about the students we have right now who have suffered learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6578)|
| 1:49:44| are you wanting to know what are we doing for the ones in our system right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| Well, your system said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| What I'm saying is what can we do for the kids that we addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| that said when we passed them on, we gave them diplomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6595)|
| 1:49:58| and out the door they went, and they're not prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| They shouldn't have gone outside, gone through the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6601)|
| 1:50:04| and we handed them diplomas if they didn't make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6604)|
| 1:50:07| And, you know, you say they failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6607)|
| 1:50:10| Well, they didn't fail them, the system failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6610)|
| 1:50:12| And what do we do for them, or what can we do for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6612)|
| 1:50:16| I know what we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| Last year we did offer several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6618)|
| 1:50:20| So that's something our high school principals already track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6620)|
| 1:50:23| Our high school principals and counselors track students where they are in their grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| and where they are throughout their entire high school career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| And then they offer opportunities for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6632)|
| 1:50:34| And this is something we did pre-pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| They offer opportunities for them to learn that material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| and recover it either during that class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6639)|
| 1:50:42| or they have blitz periods that are at the end of each semester| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| because the students do need that material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| You know, we don't want them to just fail and not have that information or that learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| And so we invested in quite a bit of that last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| and we're paying very close attention to those juniors and seniors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| and we offered additional summer courses for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| Last year we had, I think, 751 of our juniors participated in a non-credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6667)|
| 1:51:15| We had courses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6675)|
| 1:51:16| We hired 25 teachers who taught courses on Canvas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| and students could sign up for them in math, science, reading, English language arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6679)|
| 1:51:25| and they were allowed to sign up and do two of them over the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6685)|
| 1:51:30| And so we've tried to think of some different creative ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| Sometimes we cannot get them to come back and participate, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| But we are also trying to think of the different ways that we can get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| We do not have a virtual option anymore unless they unenroll from the school they're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| and enroll in the virtual school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| And with having some parameters around who's allowed to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| and who is not allowed to do that, we've seen that those students are performing really well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6713)|
| 1:51:57| because those are students, we have students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6717)|
| 1:52:00| who have not been able to participate in our system before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6720)|
| 1:52:02| because they've been in different health situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6722)|
| 1:52:07| that have not allowed them to come into school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| They're performing really well in the distance option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6729)|
| 1:52:13| as well as just some students where it's a better fit for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| But for the most part, our students are full time in person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| and that is the plan we have moving forward is for them to be in the building in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| We do think that the magic happens when you have a teacher with the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| and they're able to engage and have that interaction in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| Again, I agree with you, but in learning also helps develop social skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6755)|
| 1:52:41| which they didn't get a lot of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| and we have a lot of kids that have some problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| Because of the mask, we have speech impediment problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| in some of the younger kids that are trying to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| A lot of parents that I know have said that they're putting their children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6773)|
| 1:52:57| in those special speech classes, finding somebody that can help them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6777)|
| 1:53:02| But again, once we let them out the door, and we've done that, what, two years now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6782)|
| 1:53:08| that we let them through the door and graduated people without the skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| And I don't know if that's going to really lose us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| or if that's going to really kill us in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| and it really is a bothersome to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| And I'm not an educator. I don't claim to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| But I know what you need to be successful when you get out of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6805)|
| 1:53:30| And one of them is social skills, math skills, and reading skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| And again, it's a great plan, but the people we lost is the concern that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| What can we do for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| And nobody's ever talked about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| Oh, we've got great plans from now on out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| but we've got kids that are going to be a detriment, not detriment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| but somebody we will have to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6832)|
| 1:53:56| That's all I wanted to talk about, how can we recover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| And I thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| That was my biggest concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6842)|
| 1:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6843)|
| 1:54:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| We have a couple of commissioners that have questions, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6846)|
| 1:54:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Thank you for presenting the data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| That was very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6851)|
| 1:54:13| I guess my question is, we have a lot of citizens who watch this broadcast live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6853)|
| 1:54:20| and I'm sure before I get home or tomorrow I'm going to get a text or a phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| from a constituent who will be looking at that data and saw where 2017, 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6866)|
| 1:54:34| we were way up here, 2019, 2020, 21, we went down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6874)|
| 1:54:40| And the question that I'm sure they're going to ask me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6880)|
| 1:54:44| did any of your team tabulate the potential impact to those students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| and teachers wearing masks, and how much was that attributed to learning loss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| where a child couldn't hear the teacher, couldn't hear their classmates, vice versa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| So, in my department, we did not – that's not something that we were able to look at or project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6902)|
| 1:55:09| Our goal was to try to have as much in-person instruction as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| So what that allowed us to do in reopening in 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| having masks allowed us to be open 93% of the time that year, or at least –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6919)|
| 1:55:25| and the parents who, because we had the virtual option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| we also had 19,000 students who chose to be virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6928)|
| 1:55:32| Having all those options, I think, gave us that ability to be open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6932)|
| 1:55:36| So we saw that we lost ground compared to where we were before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| but we lost less than other districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| We were not the districts that were not able to be in-person until March of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| So then this year, of course, we intended to open with a different plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| and had to pivot on that plan in order to comply with the federal mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| But our focus was on what can we do to make sure that we're getting the most out of the situation that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6963)|
| 1:56:09| And that's where my team spends its time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6969)|
| 1:56:12| because the masks are not an area where my team makes those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6972)|
| 1:56:19| So we looked at a lot of best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| And so if we have ideal practice, then whatever situation we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| what is the closest approximation we can get to best practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| and support our teachers in being able to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| Thank you, Commissioner. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-220321?start=6996)|
