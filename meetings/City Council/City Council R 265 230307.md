| 1262.02 | 1267.02 | The other two streets I mentioned are major arteries that should carry most of that traffic.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1262.02)            |

| 1344.02 | 1352.02 | The hardships we mentioned in our application to them, they did not consider hardships at all that they could rule on.                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1344.02)            |
| 1352.02 | 1357.02 | They saw it as fair use issues.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1352.02)            |
| 1357.02 | 1361.02 | Our hardships did not fall under those, so they denied it.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1357.02)            |
| 1361.02 | 1372.02 | But there was feedback from that body that admitted to the fact that Venosdale is not being used in the fashion that it was intended,                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1361.02)            |
| 1372.02 | 1384.02 | but they made no mention of making any changes, providing any relief from the traffic, such as speed humps or the like.                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1372.02)            |
| 1384.02 | 1392.02 | I believe that's because they have classified it as minor artery.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1384.02)            |

| 1409.02 | 1415.02 | I would just, if any of the council members have any questions to the packets that we've handed out,                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1409.02)            |
| 1415.02 | 1422.02 | I would like to further elaborate on the correlation of Gallaher View, Wise Garbo, and Venosdale.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1415.02)            |
| 1422.02 | 1428.02 | According to the city road plan, they are all designated the same type of roadways.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1422.02)            |
| 1428.02 | 1432.02 | Venosdale has 32 residential properties.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1428.02)            |
| 1432.02 | 1434.02 | Gallaher View has one.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1432.02)            |
| 1434.02 | 1436.02 | Wise Garbo has zero.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1434.02)            |
| 1436.02 | 1446.02 | Yet, Venosdale is getting the predominant amount of traffic from Middlebrook to Kingston Pike because of the mall.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1436.02)            |
| 1446.02 | 1451.02 | It can very easily be satisfied by shutting the thruway down.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1446.02)            |
| 1451.02 | 1459.02 | Shutting it down at the I-40-75 overpass still allows the fire department adequate access.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1451.02)            |
| 1459.02 | 1466.02 | It still allows parents to route down Venosdale from Middlebrook for school pick-up and drop-off                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1459.02)            |
| 1466.02 | 1469.02 | because it is a one-way pick-up and drop-off,                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1466.02)            |
| 1469.02 | 1477.02 | and that would completely shut down that thruway, that drag strip, that cut-through,                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1469.02)            |
| 1477.02 | 1483.02 | and that traffic should be redirected to Wise Garbo and Gallaher View                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1477.02)            |
| 1483.02 | 1493.02 | that are designed to carry the load of that traffic.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1483.02)            |
| 1493.02 | 1495.02 | Does that conclude your comments?                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1493.02)            |

| 1826.02 | 1833.02 | I believe in review of the material, I think maybe some alternatives were proposed,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1826.02)            |
| 1833.02 | 1839.02 | but that's not for me to advocate, ma'am.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1833.02)            |

| 1863.02 | 1870.02 | Could you tell us a little bit about what is going on here with the citation?                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1863.02)            |
| 1870.02 | 1871.02 | Sure.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1870.02)            |
| 1871.02 | 1877.02 | Privacy fences are limited to interior side yards or rear yards.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1871.02)            |
| 1877.02 | 1884.02 | They are prohibited anywhere from the five foot behind the front line of the house                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1877.02)            |
| 1884.02 | 1888.02 | and in the entirety of the corner side yard.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1884.02)            |
| 1888.02 | 1893.02 | Noise is regulated out of Chapter 18 of the Code of Ordinances,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1888.02)            |
| 1893.02 | 1896.02 | which is outside of the zoning code,                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1893.02)            |
| 1896.02 | 1902.02 | and the zoning code does not prohibit security fences that are open,                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1896.02)            |
| 1902.02 | 1905.02 | but they do prohibit privacy fences.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1902.02)            |
| 1905.02 | 1909.02 | So anything over 42 inches, you know, simple situation,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1905.02)            |
| 1909.02 | 1912.02 | you can take out every other slat, you still provide that security,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1909.02)            |
| 1912.02 | 1918.02 | but there's a level of visibility into the property.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1912.02)            |
| 1918.02 | 1923.02 | And so in this particular instance, there was an issue with the height of the fence                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1918.02)            |
| 1923.02 | 1927.02 | and the fact that it didn't have that transparency.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1923.02)            |
| 1927.02 | 1928.02 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1927.02)            |
| 1928.02 | 1932.02 | The height only becomes an issue when there's a lack of transparency.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1928.02)            |
| 1932.02 | 1934.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1932.02)            |
| 1934.02 | 1939.02 | And so if they could open up some do they have to open up an entire vertical slot                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1934.02)            |
| 1939.02 | 1942.02 | or could they open some up at the top?                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1939.02)            |
| 1942.02 | 1948.02 | From 42 inches up, if they removed every other slat,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1942.02)            |
| 1948.02 | 1950.02 | I don't know how deep into the weeds you want to go,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1948.02)            |
| 1950.02 | 1955.02 | but it seems like most fences have three horizontal slats                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1950.02)            |
| 1955.02 | 1957.02 | that the verticals are attached to.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1955.02)            |
| 1957.02 | 1963.02 | So essentially if you remove above the center horizontal up,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1957.02)            |
| 1963.02 | 1966.02 | I would imagine that would make it compliant.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1963.02)            |
| 1966.02 | 1967.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1966.02)            |

| 1980.02 | 1983.02 | Mr. Ahrens, you can stick around, too, just in case one of them is for you.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1980.02)            |
| 1983.02 | 1987.02 | Ms. Pelicano, do you know about what year your house was built?                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1983.02)            |

| 1988.02 | 1989.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1988.02)            |
| 1989.02 | 1992.02 | So 86, and this is the first fence.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1989.02)            |
| 1992.02 | 1994.02 | I saw there was a chain-link fence before that.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1992.02)            |
| 1994.02 | 1999.02 | Yes, we replaced the existing chain-link fence, which was at 42 inches,                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1994.02)            |
| 1999.02 | 2004.02 | and we actually pushed it back an additional three feet from the sidewalk                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=1999.02)            |

| 2008.02 | 2010.02 | But that was a 42-inch open fence.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2008.02)            |
| 2010.02 | 2011.02 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2010.02)            |

| 2046.02 | 2048.02 | So it wasn't secured and it was behind the chain-link fence.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2046.02)            |

| 2055.02 | 2056.02 | I'm going to ask Mr. Ahrens a question.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2055.02)            |
| 2056.02 | 2059.02 | Sir, we have time limits, so I'm not trying to rush you.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2056.02)            |
| 2059.02 | 2061.02 | I'm just trying to keep in my time limits.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2059.02)            |
| 2061.02 | 2068.02 | Mr. Ahrens, when I read the code about the open fences do not have a limit,                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2061.02)            |
| 2068.02 | 2074.02 | so the fence could be any amount tall as long as 42 inches and above is not solid.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2068.02)            |
| 2074.02 | 2075.02 | It skips a slat.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2074.02)            |
| 2075.02 | 2076.02 | Yes, ma'am.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2075.02)            |
| 2076.02 | 2077.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2076.02)            |
| 2077.02 | 2083.02 | So is there a measurement for how much the missing slats have to be?                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2077.02)            |
| 2083.02 | 2085.02 | They don't have to be equal?                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2083.02)            |
| 2085.02 | 2089.02 | I'm just asking.                                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2085.02)            |
| 2089.02 | 2090.02 | We're not going to get that detailed.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2089.02)            |
| 2090.02 | 2091.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2090.02)            |
| 2091.02 | 2093.02 | If they remove every other slat, we're good.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2091.02)            |
| 2093.02 | 2094.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2093.02)            |
| 2094.02 | 2099.02 | But the Pelicanos could have a 72-inch tall fence or above.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2094.02)            |
| 2099.02 | 2104.02 | It's just from 42 inches and above is where they need to saw off the slats                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2099.02)            |
| 2104.02 | 2110.02 | so that the cars can see through at the intersection.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2104.02)            |
| 2110.02 | 2113.02 | But our fence does not block the intersection.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2110.02)            |
| 2113.02 | 2118.02 | That's the reason for the code, and that's the code we have to work with.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2113.02)            |

| 2649.02 | 2653.02 | So, I'm going to make a motion to approve the appeal.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2649.02)            |
| 2653.02 | 2655.02 | Second.                                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2653.02)            |
| 2655.02 | 2657.02 | Okay, the motion has been made to approve the appeal.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2655.02)            |
| 2657.02 | 2659.02 | It has been made and seconded.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2657.02)            |

| 2663.02 | 2667.02 | Yeah, just one more question for the Pelicanos.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2663.02)            |
| 2667.02 | 2671.02 | In the MLS listing from when the house was listed, when you purchased it,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2667.02)            |
| 2671.02 | 2675.02 | there was a privacy barrier around your back patio.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2671.02)            |
| 2675.02 | 2677.02 | Was that there when you purchased the property?                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2675.02)            |
| 2677.02 | 2681.02 | Yes, and it was very dilapidated and rotting.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2677.02)            |
| 2681.02 | 2687.02 | And that was one of the first things we removed from the property because it was unsafe.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2681.02)            |
| 2687.02 | 2689.02 | Okay, so you didn't replace it.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2687.02)            |
| 2689.02 | 2691.02 | You just removed that.                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2689.02)            |
| 2691.02 | 2698.02 | But does it seem now that that's why it was there, to provide privacy from the concerns that you have?                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2691.02)            |
| 2698.02 | 2702.02 | We believe they had a hot tub in there at some point,                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2698.02)            |
| 2702.02 | 2708.02 | but we were never able to clarify why it was closed three sides to the house.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2702.02)            |
| 2708.02 | 2710.02 | That structure was not safe.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2708.02)            |
| 2710.02 | 2712.02 | Oh, it's in the packet that you gave us.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2710.02)            |
| 2712.02 | 2713.02 | It is.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2712.02)            |
| 2713.02 | 2718.02 | There's a picture of it and then how we just replaced the decking on the deck and made it an open deck.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2713.02)            |
| 2718.02 | 2721.02 | We also replaced the door that surrounded it.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2718.02)            |
| 2721.02 | 2722.02 | Oh, I see.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2721.02)            |
| 2722.02 | 2723.02 | Yeah.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2722.02)            |
| 2723.02 | 2725.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2723.02)            |
| 2725.02 | 2726.02 | It was an eyesore.                                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2725.02)            |
| 2726.02 | 2727.02 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2726.02)            |
| 2727.02 | 2730.02 | Us trying to make the property more presentable for the neighborhood.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2727.02)            |
| 2730.02 | 2731.02 | Right.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2730.02)            |
| 2731.02 | 2741.02 | So the only thing I'll say is that is how the previous homeowners addressed the issues that you're concerned about.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2731.02)            |
| 2741.02 | 2746.02 | They fenced in their area with a privacy screen attached to the house.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2741.02)            |
| 2746.02 | 2752.02 | No, that would have done nothing to abate the amount of noise that we get on the bedroom side of the home.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2746.02)            |
| 2752.02 | 2753.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2752.02)            |
| 2753.02 | 2760.02 | All I'll say to my colleagues is what makes this distinctly different than the other fence that we had an appeal on is this is a corner lot,                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2753.02)            |
| 2760.02 | 2762.02 | not an interior lot.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2760.02)            |
| 2762.02 | 2769.02 | And so I have concern about overriding the engineer's desire to not impede intersections.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2762.02)            |

| 2811.02 | 2816.02 | I do think that this is the case for many corner lots across the city.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2811.02)            |
| 2816.02 | 2823.02 | There are a lot of corner lots next to elementary schools and middle schools, and so I don't mean to minimize your burden.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2816.02)            |
| 2823.02 | 2829.02 | I think it's shared by others, and so I just don't think it meets the letter of what we're supposed to vote on for this.                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2823.02)            |
| 2829.02 | 2835.02 | I can appreciate the hardship emotionally and tangibly for your property,                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2829.02)            |
| 2835.02 | 2843.02 | but as it relates to the variance in our code and to be equitable for other corner lots besides schools across the city,                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2835.02)            |

| 2847.02 | 2855.02 | and I actually think that every other slat removal is a good solution that blocks most of the visibility into your property                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2847.02)            |

| 2873.02 | 2879.02 | The only thing I would say, I understand my colleague Mr. Smith's point about that.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2873.02)            |
| 2879.02 | 2892.02 | My question is, does, and this is just a hypothetical question, but does being on a minor artery next to a school,                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2879.02)            |
| 2892.02 | 2902.02 | I do think that's different than being next to a corner lot in a school that is not a double yellow lined,                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=2892.02)            |

| 3411.02 | 3412.02 | come forward.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3411.02)            |

| 3416.02 | 3423.02 | Maybe you could share why this is important to the hospital and, if possible, the impact                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3416.02)            |

| 3425.02 | 3427.02 | Thank you, Councilman Smith.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3425.02)            |
| 3427.02 | 3429.02 | I'm Dennis Ragsdale.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3427.02)            |

| 3433.02 | 3436.02 | I'm also a board chair emeritus of the hospital.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3433.02)            |
| 3436.02 | 3440.02 | We've been looking at this traffic situation for a long time.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3436.02)            |
| 3440.02 | 3445.02 | That area of 21st is a one-way traffic currently.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3440.02)            |
| 3445.02 | 3450.02 | This is mainly a safety item because we have traffic coming the wrong way, sometimes at                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3445.02)            |

| 3456.02 | 3461.02 | Also, there have been at least two or three occasions on which trucks have struck the                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3456.02)            |

| 3467.02 | 3470.02 | So, we think it's really more of a safety issue.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3467.02)            |
| 3470.02 | 3472.02 | I understand the concerns about traffic.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3470.02)            |

| 3489.02 | 3493.02 | As Mr. Ragsdale points out, this is a concern about safety.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3489.02)            |

| 3516.02 | 3522.02 | And as Dennis points out, we've had issues with the skybridge that connects those buildings                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3516.02)            |

| 3524.02 | 3528.02 | So, the request is around those safety items.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3524.02)            |
| 3528.02 | 3533.02 | And as I think Mr. Clabo pointed out, the traffic study that was asked for by the Department                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3528.02)            |

| 3556.02 | 3560.02 | I do think I reached out to long-term residents of the neighborhood, and they had two primary                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3556.02)            |
| 3560.02 | 3561.02 | concerns.                                                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3560.02)            |
| 3561.02 | 3567.02 | One was that pedestrian and bicycle pass-through not be impeded.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3561.02)            |
| 3567.02 | 3572.02 | And so, I think there were multiple renderings that have been done to achieve that based                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3567.02)            |
| 3572.02 | 3574.02 | on the neighborhood input.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3572.02)            |
| 3574.02 | 3580.02 | And the second was that, generally speaking, the city should retain long-term rights to                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3574.02)            |
| 3580.02 | 3582.02 | the property.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3580.02)            |
| 3582.02 | 3584.02 | And so, that's in this agreement as well.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3582.02)            |
| 3584.02 | 3589.02 | So, those are the two concerns I heard from the neighborhood that the applicant was willing                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3584.02)            |

| 3592.02 | 3593.02 | That was it.                                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3592.02)            |
| 3593.02 | 3594.02 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3593.02)            |
| 3594.02 | 3599.02 | I just want to thank East Tennessee Children's Hospital for, first, all you do for our community                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3594.02)            |
| 3599.02 | 3604.02 | and region, and also for your flexibility when we brought these concerns to your attention.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3599.02)            |
| 3604.02 | 3610.02 | You guys were very open to accommodating the needs of the city and the neighborhood.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3604.02)            |
| 3610.02 | 3613.02 | So, thank you very much.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3610.02)            |

| 3616.02 | 3620.02 | Seeing none, Council Member Parker.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3616.02)            |
| 3620.02 | 3631.02 | I appreciate the explanation from Children's Hospital and understand the constraints and                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3620.02)            |
| 3631.02 | 3638.02 | concerns that you're working to address.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3631.02)            |
| 3638.02 | 3641.02 | From the city side of it, I still have concerns about our plans.                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3638.02)            |
| 3641.02 | 3648.02 | And I'd like to know more about what you, Mr. Clabo, briefly mentioned about another                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3641.02)            |
| 3649.02 | 3653.02 | Actually, could you repeat what you said, which street you're looking at making a two-lane,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3649.02)            |
| 3653.02 | 3655.02 | two-direction street?                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3653.02)            |
| 3655.02 | 3656.02 | Sure.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3655.02)            |
| 3656.02 | 3658.02 | And it's currently two directions.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3656.02)            |
| 3658.02 | 3666.02 | But the overall plan is on 20th Street, there's now three commercial loading spaces.                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3658.02)            |
| 3666.02 | 3671.02 | Those will be removed as part of the hub, the residential development that's going on                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3666.02)            |
| 3671.02 | 3673.02 | down there.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3671.02)            |
| 3673.02 | 3676.02 | And that 20th Street will be converted.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3673.02)            |
| 3676.02 | 3681.02 | And it will have a right turn and a left turn going southbound to Cumberland.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3676.02)            |
| 3684.02 | 3687.02 | Currently, right now, there's only one lane each direction.                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3684.02)            |
| 3687.02 | 3693.02 | So, we'll be essentially reallocating parking space to a turn lane.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3687.02)            |
| 3693.02 | 3695.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3693.02)            |
| 3695.02 | 3704.02 | I have reservations, but I will hold off on that and wait and see how the project moves forward.                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3695.02)            |
| 3704.02 | 3707.02 | I think I'll abstain because I don't have enough information.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3704.02)            |

| 3816.02 | 3821.02 | Well, I think that, for the most part, this is relatively straightforward.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3816.02)            |
| 3821.02 | 3827.02 | If you all have had the opportunity to read through the packet that we put together, of course,                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3821.02)            |
| 3827.02 | 3834.02 | it's a very robust project and planned development being a new zoning overlay that's allowed                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3827.02)            |
| 3834.02 | 3840.02 | after recode in the city is, of course, a very robust process.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3834.02)            |
| 3841.02 | 3847.02 | And so this is our first hurdle in the process and our first step.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3841.02)            |
| 3847.02 | 3854.02 | And so from here, once this is approved, we will continue to hash out the details of this design                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3847.02)            |
| 3854.02 | 3859.02 | and this plan and come back with the final plan to Planning Commission.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3854.02)            |
| 3859.02 | 3868.02 | I also want to point out and just make note that we have put in a lot of work to meet with neighbors                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3859.02)            |
| 3868.02 | 3870.02 | and meet with the neighborhood and listen to concerns.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3868.02)            |
| 3870.02 | 3877.02 | And so we've tried our best to include any potential things that we can do in the development process                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3870.02)            |

| 3964.02 | 3967.02 | All of the school buses enter and exit through Decatur Road,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3964.02)            |
| 3967.02 | 3969.02 | that's located next to Gilbert School.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3967.02)            |
| 3969.02 | 3972.02 | Currently, in the morning and evenings, traffic on Gilbert School can get backed up                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3969.02)            |
| 3972.02 | 3975.02 | all the way to Decatur from the intersection of Woodlawn and Galbraith.                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3972.02)            |
| 3975.02 | 3977.02 | There's a bottleneck that is created at that intersection during these times                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3975.02)            |
| 3977.02 | 3979.02 | that already causes a great deal of traffic.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3977.02)            |
| 3979.02 | 3983.02 | My concern is what the impact of the additional 75 units will do to this area.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3979.02)            |
| 3983.02 | 3986.02 | It's my understanding that a new development of 75 units                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3983.02)            |
| 3986.02 | 3988.02 | is not required to hold a traffic study of the area,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3986.02)            |
| 3988.02 | 3993.02 | but is there something similar that we can look at as to any impact that it may have?                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3988.02)            |
| 3993.02 | 3995.02 | There may not be any issues that come from this,                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3993.02)            |
| 3995.02 | 3997.02 | and the current traffic we do have may not be exacerbated by this,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3995.02)            |
| 3997.02 | 4000.02 | but my concern is asking the question now rather than after the fact                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=3997.02)            |
| 4000.02 | 4004.02 | in the case that it causes some problems.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4000.02)            |
| 4004.02 | 4007.02 | My second concern is the parking.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4004.02)            |
| 4007.02 | 4011.02 | There's currently 83 spaces proposed for 75 units.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4007.02)            |
| 4011.02 | 4015.02 | To be honest, I didn't even consider this an issue at the first hearing about the development,                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4011.02)            |
| 4015.02 | 4018.02 | but the more I thought about it, those numbers really don't seem to add up.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4015.02)            |
| 4018.02 | 4021.02 | If the parking lot is full, residents and guests will have to find parking elsewhere,                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4018.02)            |
| 4021.02 | 4023.02 | and I'm afraid this may lead to people parking directly on Galbraith Road,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4021.02)            |
| 4023.02 | 4025.02 | which would be extremely unsafe,                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4023.02)            |
| 4025.02 | 4029.02 | or the possibility of residents parking on nearby side streets like the one that I live on.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4025.02)            |
| 4029.02 | 4033.02 | We already have many residents on my street that utilize street parking outside of their homes.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4029.02)            |
| 4033.02 | 4036.02 | I would hate for them to have to compete for parking with residents of this new development.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4033.02)            |
| 4036.02 | 4039.02 | Again, I'm in no way against this development and welcome our new neighbors with open arms.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4036.02)            |
| 4039.02 | 4043.02 | My hope is that anything that can be done to lessen the impact on current residents is taken into consideration.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4039.02)            |
| 4043.02 | 4045.02 | Thank you.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4043.02)            |

| 4047.02 | 4050.02 | Councilmembers, that concludes people signed up to speak on this item.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4047.02)            |

| 4051.02 | 4052.02 | Thank you, Mayor.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4051.02)            |
| 4052.02 | 4055.02 | I want to applaud the South Woodlawn neighborhood.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4052.02)            |
| 4055.02 | 4058.02 | They've been welcoming to many new neighbors over the past decade,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4055.02)            |
| 4058.02 | 4062.02 | and their hospitality is very generous,                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4058.02)            |
| 4063.02 | 4068.02 | and I welcome every neighborhood to follow suit in finding a way to welcome new neighbors.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4063.02)            |
| 4068.02 | 4073.02 | Just for my colleagues as a refresher, if you'll remember, this body has already heard this,                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4068.02)            |
| 4073.02 | 4077.02 | voted on a planned development for this property before,                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4073.02)            |
| 4077.02 | 4079.02 | so this is a new run at it,                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4077.02)            |
| 4079.02 | 4083.02 | and planned development also includes a public benefit,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4079.02)            |
| 4083.02 | 4085.02 | so that's a rare element of this as well,                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4083.02)            |
| 4085.02 | 4089.02 | and I think the best public benefit for this is traffic safety.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4085.02)            |
| 4089.02 | 4093.02 | So I think there are three concerns that I've heard from South Woodlawn,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4089.02)            |
| 4093.02 | 4095.02 | not to repeat all of Mr. Phillips' comments,                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4093.02)            |
| 4095.02 | 4098.02 | but the first is a macro level.                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4095.02)            |
| 4098.02 | 4100.02 | Because of your hospitality, there's a lot more people.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4098.02)            |
| 4100.02 | 4105.02 | Because of the investment in Baker Creek and other amenities, a lot more people want to visit and live there.                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4100.02)            |
| 4105.02 | 4113.02 | So I think there's been significant traffic added to this area over the past five to seven years.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4105.02)            |
| 4113.02 | 4115.02 | Mr. Brace, we spoke last week.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4113.02)            |
| 4115.02 | 4122.02 | I think it would do well to have the administration over the next year look at this corridor,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4115.02)            |
| 4122.02 | 4125.02 | for lack of a better phrase, but this close nearby area                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4122.02)            |
| 4125.02 | 4132.02 | and see what traffic safety concerns have emerged in the overall corridor.                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4125.02)            |
| 4132.02 | 4135.02 | Is that something the administration can look at over the next year?                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4132.02)            |
| 4135.02 | 4136.02 | Yeah, I actually talked.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4135.02)            |
| 4136.02 | 4137.02 | Thank you very much for the question.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4136.02)            |
| 4137.02 | 4141.02 | Yes, we did have a discussion, and I talked with Mr. Cannon.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4137.02)            |
| 4141.02 | 4148.02 | We had a brief conversation with Mr. Clabo about our transportation division doing some analysis of that corridor.                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4141.02)            |
| 4148.02 | 4152.02 | Even though the thresholds weren't met for that, we believe that we should look at that.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4148.02)            |
| 4152.02 | 4153.02 | So, yes, sir.                                                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4152.02)            |
| 4153.02 | 4154.02 | All right.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4153.02)            |
| 4154.02 | 4155.02 | Thank you for that.                                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4154.02)            |
| 4155.02 | 4160.02 | The second concern is the specific point of entry and the kind of tricky sight lines.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4155.02)            |
| 4160.02 | 4164.02 | This is another corner lot beside a school.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4160.02)            |
| 4165.02 | 4171.02 | There's traffic entry and exit on Decatur right beside the property.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4165.02)            |
| 4171.02 | 4178.02 | Part of the conditions for this, number four and five, are confirming sight distance at the driveway access points,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4171.02)            |
| 4178.02 | 4182.02 | and number five is meeting all the requirements of city engineering department.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4178.02)            |
| 4182.02 | 4185.02 | Mr. Clabo, we also talked about this real specific point of entry.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4182.02)            |
| 4185.02 | 4186.02 | There's a hill.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4185.02)            |
| 4186.02 | 4187.02 | There's a sight line.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4186.02)            |
| 4187.02 | 4188.02 | There's a school entry.                                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4187.02)            |
| 4189.02 | 4194.02 | And so because of the number of units, the applicant doesn't have to do a traffic study.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4189.02)            |
| 4194.02 | 4200.02 | But I do think an extra lens or an extra kind of review by somebody in traffic engineering is important,                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4194.02)            |
| 4200.02 | 4202.02 | particularly for that point of entry.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4200.02)            |
| 4202.02 | 4207.02 | Is that something city engineering can do as part of this review of this development?                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4202.02)            |
| 4207.02 | 4208.02 | It is.                                                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4207.02)            |
| 4208.02 | 4215.02 | And as we receive plans, that entry point will have to be certified by their design consultant as well.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4208.02)            |
| 4215.02 | 4222.02 | So there will be a review of the sight distance there to make sure it meets all the standards.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4215.02)            |
| 4222.02 | 4223.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4222.02)            |
| 4223.02 | 4227.02 | So the improvement could be mild, but that review will be taken care of as part of these number four                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4223.02)            |
| 4227.02 | 4229.02 | and number five conditions that I just read.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4227.02)            |
| 4229.02 | 4230.02 | That's correct.                                                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4229.02)            |
| 4230.02 | 4231.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4230.02)            |
| 4231.02 | 4234.02 | And the third element is related to parking spillover.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4231.02)            |
| 4234.02 | 4236.02 | I think Mr. Phillips mentioned this.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4234.02)            |
| 4236.02 | 4238.02 | Mr. Higgins, if I could have you come back up.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4236.02)            |
| 4238.02 | 4242.02 | We spoke earlier this week as well.                                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4238.02)            |
| 4242.02 | 4249.02 | We discussed incorporating a specific policy into the tenant operating agreement to prevent some type of spillover.                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4242.02)            |
| 4249.02 | 4253.02 | Apartment management is obviously responsible for making sure people park on their site,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4249.02)            |
| 4253.02 | 4255.02 | but there wasn't a condition listed in there.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4253.02)            |
| 4255.02 | 4258.02 | So is that something the applicant would be willing to do?                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4255.02)            |
| 4258.02 | 4259.02 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4258.02)            |
| 4259.02 | 4267.02 | We're completely fine with making sure that the tenants understand that they need to be parking on site                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4259.02)            |
| 4267.02 | 4270.02 | and not to park on other people's property for sure.                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4267.02)            |
| 4270.02 | 4271.02 | Okay.                                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4270.02)            |
| 4271.02 | 4279.02 | And what we discussed was a formal piece, some type of statement in the operating agreement with the tenant                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4271.02)            |
| 4279.02 | 4284.02 | or the management procedures of the property to assure that, not just hope for it.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4279.02)            |
| 4284.02 | 4285.02 | Yes.                                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4284.02)            |
| 4285.02 | 4288.02 | So unless there's any questions from our colleagues,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4285.02)            |
| 4288.02 | 4293.02 | I would like to make a motion to add a seventh condition to this based on that,                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4288.02)            |
| 4293.02 | 4297.02 | and I'll just read what I've written here for that amendment.                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4293.02)            |
| 4297.02 | 4302.02 | Including an off-site parking prevention policy in the property operating agreement with tenants.                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4297.02)            |
| 4302.02 | 4307.02 | And I believe both the applicant, the neighborhood, and the city are all agreeable to that.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4302.02)            |
| 4307.02 | 4312.02 | So that's the formal motion I would make to add to this plan development.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4307.02)            |
| 4312.02 | 4313.02 | I'll second that.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4312.02)            |
| 4313.02 | 4320.02 | So motion to amend by adding the language that Councilmember Smith just said, just recited,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4313.02)            |
| 4320.02 | 4322.02 | it's been made and seconded.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4320.02)            |
| 4322.02 | 4323.02 | Any questions?                                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4322.02)            |
| 4323.02 | 4324.02 | Councilmember Parker?                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4323.02)            |
| 4324.02 | 4328.02 | Yeah, can you share a little bit more about how that would work?                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4324.02)            |
| 4328.02 | 4337.02 | Well, I intentionally put the ownership on the applicant to address that in their operating procedures.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4328.02)            |
| 4337.02 | 4342.02 | So I don't manage properties, so I didn't want to kind of put my lack of expertise onto them,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4337.02)            |
| 4342.02 | 4348.02 | but they have agreed to dictate that in the operating agreement with the tenants.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4342.02)            |
| 4348.02 | 4351.02 | And accordingly, if we make this amendment,                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4348.02)            |
| 4351.02 | 4356.02 | planning will have to review that as well as one of the conditions in this.                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4351.02)            |
| 4356.02 | 4362.02 | And if it's insufficient, the neighborhood can appeal to city council.                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4356.02)            |

| 4548.02 | 4556.02 | So I'm just wondering why did we not address Paragraph A at the same time we were addressing Paragraph B?                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4548.02)            |

| 4652.02 | 4656.02 | the discussion all revolved around stormwater.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4652.02)            |
| 4656.02 | 4661.02 | And there was discussion about how this would have little to no impact on anyone                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4656.02)            |
| 4661.02 | 4666.02 | to pass it as it was passed December 5th, 2017.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4661.02)            |

| 4703.02 | 4706.02 | And then all of a sudden, all of us can't do even a shed.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4703.02)            |

| 4716.02 | 4722.02 | So, because I don't believe in abstaining, I'm going to go ahead and vote yes on this tonight.                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4716.02)            |

| 4732.02 | 4735.02 | because we have to fix the definition of lot of record,                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4732.02)            |
| 4735.02 | 4740.02 | and we can't keep punishing everybody for not asking for the word maps to be fixed                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4735.02)            |
| 4740.02 | 4745.02 | from the moment things were built in the 1800s, 1900s, and on.                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4740.02)            |
| 4745.02 | 4750.02 | So, Mr. Clabo, on the record, would you like to one more time tell me you guys are definitely working on this                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4745.02)            |
| 4750.02 | 4754.02 | and the law department is going to find some relief for our constituents?                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4750.02)            |
| 4754.02 | 4759.02 | Yes. We are definitely working on that, and that will be something we'll be bringing back to this council.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4754.02)            |
| 4759.02 | 4765.02 | Okay. And I look forward to having that discussion prior to it hitting an agenda.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4759.02)            |
| 4765.02 | 4768.02 | Thank you. Council Member Fugate.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4765.02)            |
| 4768.02 | 4772.02 | I echo what my colleague, Councilwoman Ryder, said.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4768.02)            |
| 4772.02 | 4778.02 | I'm more to the point about when do we think we can expect something                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4772.02)            |
| 4778.02 | 4785.02 | because we've been talking about this for at least a year or more that we're working on it,                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4778.02)            |
| 4785.02 | 4790.02 | and I understand it's hard, but in the meantime, we have people who are stuck.                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4785.02)            |
| 4790.02 | 4798.02 | Any idea, Mr. Clabo, what's the target? I mean, is it two more months?                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4790.02)            |
| 4798.02 | 4800.02 | Ms. Fugate, thank you for that question.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4798.02)            |
| 4800.02 | 4808.02 | I just want to say that it's very important to me, both as mayor and as owner of a 1905 home,                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4800.02)            |
| 4808.02 | 4812.02 | and your constituents and my constituents are the same.                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4808.02)            |
| 4812.02 | 4814.02 | So this is an important issue.                                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4812.02)            |
| 4814.02 | 4823.02 | Both this agenda item and 12A are directly in response to concerns from whether single individual property owners                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4814.02)            |
| 4823.02 | 4828.02 | or developers, the feedback we got from the developers roundtable,                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4823.02)            |
| 4828.02 | 4835.02 | and then this council supported our hiring of the outside consultant to help us examine                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4828.02)            |
| 4835.02 | 4843.02 | and come up with recommendations to overhaul, streamline, update, and improve our development services.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4835.02)            |
| 4843.02 | 4850.02 | And again, that's for a huge commercial development or someone trying to do a shed in their backyard.                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4843.02)            |
| 4850.02 | 4855.02 | We are taking those on, and Mr. Cannon, as our chief of economic development,                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4850.02)            |
| 4855.02 | 4860.02 | because this is an economic development issue, as well as engineering and technical one,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4855.02)            |

| 4867.02 | 4869.02 | and to the public for the fixes.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4867.02)            |
| 4869.02 | 4874.02 | Mr. Cannon, do you have anything you can add and share as far as expected time                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4869.02)            |
| 4874.02 | 4878.02 | to bring more of these solutions to council?                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4874.02)            |
| 4878.02 | 4879.02 | Yes, ma'am.                                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4878.02)            |
| 4879.02 | 4881.02 | Excuse me.                                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4879.02)            |
| 4881.02 | 4883.02 | First, let me say that Mr. Merlo's comments are spot on.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4881.02)            |
| 4883.02 | 4888.02 | That's a concern of ours, too, as is Councilwoman Ryder's.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4883.02)            |
| 4888.02 | 4892.02 | Our intent had been to come this month with that.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4888.02)            |
| 4892.02 | 4897.02 | We need to do a little more work to get this as simple as possible.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4892.02)            |
| 4897.02 | 4900.02 | Our intent is to bring it to you in May.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4897.02)            |
| 4900.02 | 4904.02 | I will tell you that it's subject to, and this is still up for discussion,                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4900.02)            |
| 4904.02 | 4907.02 | whether we need to go to the Planning Commission or not.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4904.02)            |
| 4907.02 | 4909.02 | If we have to go to the Planning Commission first,                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=4907.02)            |

| 5685.02 | 5689.02 | Mr. Bowen, if you could state your name and address for the record.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5685.02)            |
| 5689.02 | 5690.02 | Thank you, Mayor.                                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5689.02)            |
| 5690.02 | 5694.02 | Will Bowen, 5669 Eagle Crest Lane, Knoxville.                                                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5690.02)            |
| 5694.02 | 5698.02 | So I wanted to come up and speak about Lisa Edwards,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5694.02)            |
| 5698.02 | 5705.02 | who had her life wrongfully taken from her a couple weeks ago in KPD custody.                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5698.02)            |
| 5706.02 | 5712.02 | And this is really the fault of the hospital and KPD.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5706.02)            |
| 5712.02 | 5717.02 | I don't want to put the blame on one specific organization because they both failed her.                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5712.02)            |
| 5717.02 | 5720.02 | So we'll just keep that in mind.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5717.02)            |
| 5720.02 | 5725.02 | But you all don't exactly have jurisdiction over Fort Sanders since it's a private hospital.                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5720.02)            |
| 5725.02 | 5735.02 | Anyway, so the four officers that took care of, that were present at this incident,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5725.02)            |
| 5735.02 | 5741.02 | Adam Barnett, Timothy D'Eustachio, Sergeant Brandon Wardlaw,                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5735.02)            |
| 5741.02 | 5744.02 | and Transportation Officer Danny Dugan.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5741.02)            |
| 5744.02 | 5747.02 | They're all on administrative leave right now.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5744.02)            |
| 5747.02 | 5751.02 | So, you know, the thing about internal affairs investigations,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5747.02)            |
| 5751.02 | 5757.02 | which I understand that we have to give people, you know, not benefit of the doubt,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5751.02)            |
| 5757.02 | 5760.02 | but innocent until proven guilty, you know.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5757.02)            |
| 5760.02 | 5766.02 | But internal affairs, when you're investigating yourself naturally,                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5760.02)            |
| 5766.02 | 5773.02 | there's not going to be justice the way it should be.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5766.02)            |
| 5773.02 | 5776.02 | I feel like we've seen that a lot in the last couple years,                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5773.02)            |
| 5776.02 | 5782.02 | especially with the, we've gotten movements, you know, against police brutality the last couple years.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5776.02)            |
| 5782.02 | 5785.02 | Of course, we're all familiar with that.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5782.02)            |
| 5785.02 | 5796.02 | But, you know, no public statement being made other than like surface level stuff is not sufficient                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5785.02)            |
| 5796.02 | 5800.02 | because a family lost a family member.                                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5796.02)            |
| 5800.02 | 5807.02 | Like that's, I can't imagine the pain that they're going through.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5800.02)            |
| 5807.02 | 5810.02 | And Lisa had just moved to Knoxville.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5807.02)            |
| 5810.02 | 5812.02 | She wanted to come back.                                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5810.02)            |
| 5812.02 | 5824.02 | She wanted to, you know, be comfortable in Knoxville, and that was taken away from her.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5812.02)            |
| 5824.02 | 5835.02 | I think more, you all can do more to assure the public that you're going to hold the officers accountable                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5824.02)            |
| 5835.02 | 5842.02 | that were present when Lisa passed away.                                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5835.02)            |
| 5842.02 | 5846.02 | And, I mean, this all goes back to police training, right?                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5842.02)            |
| 5846.02 | 5851.02 | You should be able to tell when somebody's in medical distress.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5846.02)            |
| 5851.02 | 5860.02 | And when you've got somebody that's in your custody that is clearly in medical distress,                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5851.02)            |
| 5860.02 | 5866.02 | I mean, I don't know how to explain this in a way that's not complete common sense.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5860.02)            |
| 5866.02 | 5869.02 | You know, you take care of people that need help.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5866.02)            |
| 5869.02 | 5873.02 | And I understand that the hospital discharged her, but that's beside the point.                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5869.02)            |
| 5873.02 | 5878.02 | If you can see that there's something wrong, it doesn't matter what the hospital did.                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5873.02)            |
| 5878.02 | 5885.02 | You've got to find a way to take care of her and make sure that she doesn't, that nothing happens to her.                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5878.02)            |

| 5887.02 | 5891.02 | And it's a disgrace.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5887.02)            |
| 5891.02 | 5903.02 | How can you take an oath to protect and serve and then allow a woman to die in your custody?                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5891.02)            |
| 5903.02 | 5910.02 | I don't, you know, this keeps happening, not just in Knoxville, but across the country.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5903.02)            |
| 5910.02 | 5915.02 | And I don't understand why we can't do something about it.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5910.02)            |
| 5915.02 | 5926.02 | It's, I mean, I don't know what to say that you all haven't already heard on the news and everywhere 500 times in the last couple years.                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5915.02)            |
| 5926.02 | 5943.02 | I mean, you know, it's, I just, we just, I wish that we could be reassured that they're going to be held accountable.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5926.02)            |
| 5943.02 | 5945.02 | And I understand that they're under investigation.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5943.02)            |
| 5945.02 | 5952.02 | I just, I question whether or not this investigation is impartial.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5945.02)            |
| 5953.02 | 5957.02 | Because as an internal affairs investigation, naturally they want to protect cops.                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5953.02)            |

| 5959.02 | 5960.02 | And we've seen that.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5959.02)            |

| 5964.02 | 5973.02 | You know, it's, we, the last year or so in the city of Knoxville, we've talked about bringing change to our police department.                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5964.02)            |
| 5973.02 | 5979.02 | And, you know, I wanted to have confidence that we will see change.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5973.02)            |
| 5979.02 | 5982.02 | But we haven't seen it yet.                                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5979.02)            |
| 5982.02 | 5989.02 | So we're counting on you all to fix this and help us see change in our police department.                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=5982.02)            |

| 6007.02 | 6009.02 | Thank you for allowing us to speak tonight.                                                                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6007.02)            |
| 6009.02 | 6014.02 | My name is Walker Kinzler and I'm a student at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, part of the College Democrats                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6009.02)            |
| 6014.02 | 6018.02 | and the statewide president of the Tennessee College Democrats.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6014.02)            |
| 6018.02 | 6026.02 | And the Knoxville Police Department's video of the death of Lisa Edwards was harrowing and disturbing.                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6018.02)            |
| 6026.02 | 6031.02 | Before I begin, in earnest, I'd like to also hit on something that the council doesn't have as much influence over,                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6026.02)            |
| 6031.02 | 6035.02 | and that's Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6031.02)            |
| 6035.02 | 6044.02 | Hospitals should be scrutinized just as closely and just as equally for their involvement in Miss Edwards' death.                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6035.02)            |
| 6044.02 | 6050.02 | Fort Sanders discharged her and tossed her out over her distressed objections                                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6044.02)            |
| 6050.02 | 6055.02 | and then called for the police to deal with the situation that did not require the police.                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6050.02)            |
| 6055.02 | 6059.02 | Hospitals care for and listen to their patients.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6055.02)            |
| 6059.02 | 6062.02 | They don't treat them with contempt.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6059.02)            |
| 6062.02 | 6066.02 | So Fort Sanders must go through a drastic cultural and practical change,                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6062.02)            |
| 6066.02 | 6072.02 | and I hope that the city council uses all of its influence that it has to compel them to do so.                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6066.02)            |
| 6072.02 | 6077.02 | But when the Knoxville Police Department first confronted Lisa Edwards at Fort Sanders,                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6072.02)            |
| 6077.02 | 6081.02 | she told the officers she had a stroke and could not walk.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6077.02)            |
| 6081.02 | 6088.02 | The officers did not care and demanded she leave or be arrested and sent to jail.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6081.02)            |

| 6092.02 | 6099.02 | they called a jail transport van and attempted with the driver to place her up inside.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6092.02)            |

| 6125.02 | 6133.02 | Later, after she became unconscious, an officer pulled her up by her hair to lift her head.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6125.02)            |
| 6133.02 | 6138.02 | After struggling for about 30 minutes, they instead placed Miss Edwards in the back of a cramped squad car                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6133.02)            |

| 6142.02 | 6147.02 | The officer drives away with her on her side, wheezing and sounding desperate for help.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6142.02)            |
| 6147.02 | 6152.02 | And you can see in the video, she's clearly fighting and struggling to just sit up.                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6147.02)            |
| 6152.02 | 6156.02 | And she would end up losing consciousness in that car and dying a day later.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6152.02)            |
| 6156.02 | 6160.02 | And I'm very disappointed with the Knoxville Attorney's Office,                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6156.02)            |
| 6160.02 | 6163.02 | who announced that none of the officers involved will face charges.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6160.02)            |

| 6171.02 | 6173.02 | But let me be clear.                                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6171.02)            |
| 6173.02 | 6180.02 | The officers and transport driver involved ignored Lisa Edwards' medical emergency and contributed to her death.                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6173.02)            |
| 6180.02 | 6183.02 | Their deliberate inaction contributed to her death.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6180.02)            |
| 6183.02 | 6185.02 | There are no excuses.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6183.02)            |
| 6185.02 | 6192.02 | Anyone, regardless of medical knowledge and training, can see and hear in that video that she is in medical distress.                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6185.02)            |
| 6192.02 | 6198.02 | The KPD personnel showed a constant lack of care and empathy in response to her pleas.                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6192.02)            |
| 6198.02 | 6201.02 | And her death is on their hands.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6198.02)            |
| 6201.02 | 6208.02 | The officers in the video clearly treated Miss Edwards different because they perceived her as no better than some vagrant.                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6201.02)            |
| 6208.02 | 6214.02 | Some police officers treat people as if we're part of two classes, those that seem more clean and respectful,                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6208.02)            |
| 6214.02 | 6217.02 | and those who they deem as dirty and poor.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6214.02)            |
| 6217.02 | 6220.02 | But let me tell you, that is not up for them or anyone to decide.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6217.02)            |
| 6220.02 | 6222.02 | There should be no class structures.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6220.02)            |
| 6222.02 | 6225.02 | Every single person should be treated equally.                                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6222.02)            |
| 6225.02 | 6233.02 | Also, some people like Edwards at times in the video are not able to fully articulate their needs and conditions to authorities.                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6225.02)            |
| 6233.02 | 6238.02 | And this lack of articulation should not be regarded as someone being less of a person.                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6233.02)            |
| 6238.02 | 6242.02 | The officer's president should have been her voice.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6238.02)            |
| 6242.02 | 6246.02 | They should have recognized her medical distress and got her help.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6242.02)            |
| 6246.02 | 6249.02 | They should have served and protected her.                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6246.02)            |
| 6249.02 | 6253.02 | And instead, they failed her and our community.                                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6249.02)            |
| 6254.02 | 6256.02 | I'm calling on the city council.                                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6254.02)            |

| 6258.02 | 6266.02 | Every single person that has seen that video is calling on the city council to hold those KPD personnel involved accountable.                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6258.02)            |
| 6266.02 | 6269.02 | They should already be facing charges, but they are not.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6266.02)            |
| 6269.02 | 6274.02 | And I know there is a current internal affair investigation by KPD in the matter.                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6269.02)            |
| 6274.02 | 6282.02 | And I pray that they make the correct decisions and bring about the justice that is so desperately needed to Miss Edwards.                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6274.02)            |
| 6282.02 | 6288.02 | And I can tell all of you that Knoxville is worried that there's not going to be much more than a slap on the wrist.                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6282.02)            |
| 6288.02 | 6295.02 | And the police chief has said for the past few months that he wants the department to be more equal and fair                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6288.02)            |

| 6318.02 | 6323.02 | Hi, I'm Bentley Marlow, 322 Douglas, Knoxville, 37921.                                                                                                                       | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6318.02)            |
| 6323.02 | 6328.02 | Harold, thank you for addressing and pledging to solve the issue with the Ward lot                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6323.02)            |
| 6328.02 | 6333.02 | in, I guess, something of a timely fashion for government movement.                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6328.02)            |
| 6333.02 | 6335.02 | But I want to take a moment here.                                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6333.02)            |
| 6335.02 | 6344.02 | I think this is yet again a situation in which we can see and appreciate the value of the body cameras.                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6335.02)            |
| 6344.02 | 6346.02 | And I'm glad that our city has them.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6344.02)            |
| 6346.02 | 6355.02 | And I think they have been incredibly useful in this particular issue for showing us what happened                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6346.02)            |
| 6355.02 | 6359.02 | and eliminating lots of speculation.                                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6355.02)            |
| 6359.02 | 6362.02 | I believe that the DA's office got it right.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6359.02)            |

| 6364.02 | 6367.02 | I do see—I hope it's policy violations.                                                                                                                                      | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6364.02)            |
| 6367.02 | 6370.02 | I hope there's some reprimands handed down, Chief.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6367.02)            |
| 6370.02 | 6377.02 | But I also see some things that are getting glossed over that I think need to be highlighted.                                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6370.02)            |
| 6377.02 | 6381.02 | I think the transport officer should be highlighted for standing up to his fellow officers                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6377.02)            |
| 6381.02 | 6384.02 | and refusing to load her in the back of the van.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6381.02)            |
| 6384.02 | 6387.02 | If we had more officers that would stand up to other officers,                                                                                                               | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6384.02)            |
| 6387.02 | 6390.02 | perhaps Memphis wouldn't have happened earlier this year.                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6387.02)            |
| 6390.02 | 6393.02 | Perhaps George Floyd wouldn't have happened.                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6390.02)            |
| 6393.02 | 6396.02 | I think the fact that one officer stood up and said,                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6393.02)            |
| 6396.02 | 6401.02 | no, I'm not going to do this to his other officers, including one who has stripes on his uniform,                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6396.02)            |
| 6401.02 | 6403.02 | should be celebrated.                                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6401.02)            |
| 6403.02 | 6409.02 | That our police department has a culture that allows and respects an individual officer to stand up                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6403.02)            |
| 6409.02 | 6414.02 | and say his piece and not be bullied into going along with the flow.                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6409.02)            |
| 6414.02 | 6419.02 | I also think it's worth pointing out that the initial interaction with Ms. Edwards,                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6414.02)            |
| 6419.02 | 6423.02 | the officer basically said he didn't want to arrest her.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6419.02)            |
| 6423.02 | 6427.02 | He at one point said it would be silly if he had to arrest her.                                                                                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6423.02)            |
| 6427.02 | 6431.02 | He went and talked to Fort Sanders to get their side of the story.                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6427.02)            |
| 6431.02 | 6438.02 | Up until the loading incident, when I think it was clear that the officers were very frustrated,                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6431.02)            |
| 6438.02 | 6443.02 | I really think that they were doing a pretty good job, and then their frustrations got the best of them.                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6438.02)            |
| 6443.02 | 6446.02 | But I, too, think the problem really is Fort Sanders.                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6443.02)            |
| 6446.02 | 6453.02 | Fort Sanders has resources for loading large patients that cannot stand on their own or that are too weak.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6446.02)            |
| 6453.02 | 6457.02 | Why was there not a lift chair provided by the hospital?                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6453.02)            |
| 6457.02 | 6459.02 | Why was the hospital even discharging her?                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6457.02)            |
| 6459.02 | 6462.02 | I think a lot of the frustration people have is really misplaced.                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6459.02)            |
| 6462.02 | 6467.02 | I think everyone should go to the next, I don't know, does Fort Sanders have board of director meetings?                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6462.02)            |

| 6470.02 | 6474.02 | Why did they do this? Why did Blount County do this?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6470.02)            |

| 6479.02 | 6482.02 | and I hope that the internal affairs investigation goes through,                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6479.02)            |
| 6482.02 | 6486.02 | and perhaps if we need to make policy changes that we'll make those changes.                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6482.02)            |

| 6491.02 | 6498.02 | I think it's premature to start throwing a big paintbrush and say that everything about the police is bad.                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6491.02)            |

| 6761.02 | 6768.02 | When Anthony Thompson Jr. happened, he was a high schooler in a bathroom that was approached by four officers                                                                | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6761.02)            |

| 6817.02 | 6818.02 | Let's go a little farther.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6817.02)            |

| 6819.02 | 6822.02 | Let's not forget, we fought India for those body counts.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6819.02)            |
| 6822.02 | 6825.02 | We made her commit on her last campaign to do it.                                                                                                                            | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6822.02)            |
| 6825.02 | 6832.02 | And then Amelia, myself, and Z, and Rick Roach, and many others stood here for a year after that commitment                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6825.02)            |
| 6832.02 | 6835.02 | and demanded those body counts continue to come through.                                                                                                                     | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6832.02)            |
| 6835.02 | 6837.02 | Mind you, they chose the cheapest ones that was available.                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6835.02)            |
| 6837.02 | 6838.02 | We saw three different ones.                                                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6837.02)            |
| 6838.02 | 6840.02 | There was one that was really good, great quality.                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6838.02)            |
| 6840.02 | 6843.02 | And given I'm a taxpayer for my tax dollars, I wanted the best thing.                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6840.02)            |
| 6843.02 | 6844.02 | But you gave us the cheapest version.                                                                                                                                        | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6843.02)            |
| 6844.02 | 6846.02 | However, we'll go forward.                                                                                                                                                   | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6844.02)            |
| 6846.02 | 6850.02 | Those bodies' cameras also caught Trinity Clark being sexually assaulted.                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6846.02)            |
| 6850.02 | 6857.02 | They also caught Robert Bailey with a supposed taillight-slash-headlight that was never, ever actually out or broken or busted.                                              | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6850.02)            |
| 6857.02 | 6859.02 | So probable cause has already failed this standard.                                                                                                                          | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6857.02)            |
| 6859.02 | 6864.02 | But we've seen before how the conflicting coroner reports where the hospital said he died of a heart attack,                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6859.02)            |
| 6864.02 | 6867.02 | yet Charm Alley said he died of a drug overdose.                                                                                                                             | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6864.02)            |
| 6867.02 | 6870.02 | Are you seeing how Lisa Edwards continues to happen?                                                                                                                         | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6867.02)            |
| 6870.02 | 6874.02 | And so now we fast forward where we get the full-body count.                                                                                                                 | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6870.02)            |
| 6874.02 | 6880.02 | We're seeing once again, yes, the hospital and Knoxville Police Department are responsible.                                                                                  | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6874.02)            |
| 6880.02 | 6883.02 | But again, this is a breakdown of system.                                                                                                                                    | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6880.02)            |
| 6883.02 | 6885.02 | The health care system is garbage.                                                                                                                                           | [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230307?start=6883.02)            |
