| 0:18:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1095)|

| 0:18:39| So I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1121)|

| 0:18:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Next on the agenda is 6Q, Aramark Nayland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| Evan Fabrizio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| This is David Eldridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1135)|
| 0:18:57| Eldridge and Cravens on behalf of Aramark Sports and Entertainment Services, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1137)|
| 0:19:03| With me I have, and that's located, the address is 1300 Fulmer Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1143)|
| 0:19:09| With me I have Evan Fabrizio, who is the local manager for Aramark and the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| and Mike McDonald, who is the district manager from the home office in Pittsburgh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1157)|
| 0:19:24| The application in 6Q is for a catering permit that is to permit the sales of beer in connection with catering events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1164)|
| 0:19:45| It's connected to the Nayland Stadium location, but it is a catering permit request, and that's the introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1185)|
| 0:19:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Sergeant Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| We just need the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| I don't know if they would reprint that, since it's not a premises change, but whatever they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1204)|
| 0:20:11| We noticed that and had some confusion, I guess, as to what we need to do to provide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1211)|
| 0:20:19| to just submit the one that we already have, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| I would double check with the Development Services Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| That would be my suspicion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| I don't want to speak for them, but since there's not a premises change, it's just an additional permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| I would strongly suspect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Was that the only omission from our application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| If you have any difficulty contacting the General Building Services number, then I would contact Mr. Aarons, Peter Aarons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1242)|
| 0:20:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Because you're just asking for a regenerated one of what you already have, because it's the same premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| It's just an additional service line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1266)|
| 0:21:07| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1267)|
| 0:21:08| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Will this also be volunteer run or bartenders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| This would be strictly Aramark employees, falling under the same service guidelines that we've established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| Mr. Fabrizio, so the permit that you have already is for the concession stand areas where beer is served at the games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1281)|
| 0:21:30| This is for, is this like a seated dining area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| No, this would be to activate for private event catering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| So with the development that's happening at Neyland Stadium, we will have a kitchen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| So we were looking to do more of the private event catering, whether it's at Neyland Stadium, the arena, Lindsay Nelson Stadium, receptions, buffets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| Currently, we don't have a catering permit to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| But the serving would be within this area, the 1300 Phillip Fulmer Way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1316)|
| 0:22:04| The intent for the catering permit would be for Knox County, so we could cater around campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1324)|
| 0:22:10| Similar to the state catering permit that we have for the Wine and Spirits that we can activate around campus, but it would be tied to the license at Neyland Stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1330)|
| 0:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| Mr. Frost, so that is tied, that works with the premises permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| Yes, this is just an outgrowth of TABC changing their opinion last year approximately that their caterer permit no longer covers beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1350)|
| 0:22:40| So we now have catering with beer permit, which is what Aramark is applying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you for the clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| And that is the same for all catering permits for caterers in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| They can serve outside of whatever location their license is tied to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1373)|
| 0:22:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Thank you, Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Do we have a motion and a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Did somebody make a motion already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1390)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| I'm going to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| One abstention, Ms. Hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Next agenda item, don't go far, is 6R Aramark Thompson Bowling Arena, 1600 Phillip Fulmer Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1399)|
| 0:23:29| Evan Fabrizio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Again, David Eldridge on behalf of Aramark Sports Entertainment Services, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1413)|
| 0:23:39| The location is 1600 Phillip Fulmer Way, Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1419)|
| 0:23:45| Also, for the record, Mr. Fabrizio is still here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1425)|
| 0:23:50| And this permit is an application to expand the location of the existing permit at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1430)|
| 0:24:02| Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| I'm used to saying, may I approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| I have a couple of photographs that I'd like to distribute that will allow the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| to understand what we're trying to accomplish, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1458)|
| 0:24:19| Mr. Frost will get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| I'll turn it right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1462)|
| 0:24:49| Is that part of this for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1489)|
| 0:25:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1516)|
| 0:25:44| Well, you can have my copies when we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Let me see what the questions are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| I believe we all have a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| You will note that this is an aerial view of the Thompson Bowling Arena, now known as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1559)|
| 0:26:04| the Food City Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| As stated in the application, this is a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| You speak a little closer to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1573)|
| 0:26:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1574)|
| 0:26:15| As stated in the application, this is a request to expand the premises under which that permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1575)|
| 0:26:24| can be valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| As folks well know, Knoxville is becoming quite the concert destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1589)|
| 0:26:37| And the purpose and intent of this request is to be able to establish vendors on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1597)|
| 0:26:49| ramp areas of Thompson and Bowling that would be a part of, and obviously Mr. Fregio can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1609)|
| 0:26:58| address specific questions, but would be part of the ticketed areas if individuals are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1618)|
| 0:27:05| to an event at Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1625)|
| 0:27:11| The entrances at each of the ramps would be where, in an event, the ticketed areas, individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1631)|
| 0:27:24| would come, present their ticket, and they would be into the area, if you will, under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1644)|
| 0:27:31| which their ticket is good, and they couldn't leave without being able to come back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| without being able to come back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| So the purpose of this expansion is to relieve some of the congestion that is inside Thompson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Bowling for the beer vendor locations and allow the sales of beer on those ramp areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1664)|
| 0:27:54| once they've entered that ticketed area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| The same service policy, it's going to be earmarked vendors, it's going to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1677)|
| 0:28:05| with their very thorough service training policy that is part of this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1685)|
| 0:28:12| And other than that, I'm happy to offer Mr. Fregio for particular questions, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| the purpose of this permit request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1700)|
| 0:28:21| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| So on the ramp located closest to Pratt Pavilion, the indoor basketball facility, there's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1703)|
| 0:28:31| to be beer service there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| And you can only access it after you've given your ticket to the basketball game or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| other events, a concert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Is it going to be secured at that pedestrian ramp, the long ramp where you walk down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1721)|
| 0:28:48| From the ramp to Pratt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| My assumption is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| So this also wouldn't be something that the arena would be doing for every event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| It's really specifically around concerts where the merchandise is extremely busy inside and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1739)|
| 0:29:04| creates a lot of congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Can you give us an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| Is there some recent one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| For the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Like Elton John or something, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| Specifically, a lot of what we've been talking about is the Zach Bryan back-to-back concerts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| There's so much of the merchandise sales inside that eventually the lines end up extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| congested, blocking bathrooms, blocking the concession stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| So in those instances, they would move the ticketed perimeter from the normal arena doors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| up to the tops of these ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| So, for instance, at the top of the main entrance ramp, they would have all the ticketing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| scanning of mag security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| The bridge that comes across from the garage would be funneled up through that main security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1780)|
| 0:29:45| and then the ramp from the S5 parking would also have separate ticketing and secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| So what we're looking to do is when they activate these instances where they move the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1791)|
| 0:29:57| of ingress away from those arena doors, and this becomes part of the ticketed and secured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| perimeter, we're looking to be able to sell concessions, including beer, outside in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| So if this was like Neyland Stadium, and you go in for the sake of argument through Gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| 16, if you try to leave with beer, somebody's going to be there to stop you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| And so, again, we would only activate in these areas when they have moved that ticketed perimeter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| up to the top of the ramp, which would not be every event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1823)|
| 0:30:25| But, yes, in those instances, this entire walkway around the arena would be secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| Once you've scanned your ticket, you cannot leave and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| It is essentially an extension of the inside of the arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1833)|
| 0:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1838)|
| 0:30:39| Any questions from, yes, Councilwoman Fugate, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| So just to be clear, the intent is this is not going to be for basketball games unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| we are, like, number one and we get, the crowd is so big, I'm just teasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1849)|
| 0:30:55| But, I mean, it sounds to me like it's more for non-UT-related events but for the concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| business that is done at Thompson Bowling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| For the most part, that's where the discussions have surrounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| Now, obviously, a part of them moving that ticketed perimeter to the tops of the ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| is very much weather dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| I do think it's something that they may want to do for men's basketball and hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| ladies' balls as well this coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| But, really, it would be dependent on weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1884)|
| 0:31:26| Our hope would be that any time they do move that perimeter up, we would have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| But, for the most part, the conversations around when they're able to actually expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| that true perimeter of the arena is pretty weather dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| It's weather dependent, but the reality is whenever UT decides or whatever decides that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| from now on, basically, if this happens, it doesn't matter what the event is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1907)|
| 0:31:53| As long as the security is moved outside of the building, that's where you ticket and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1913)|
| 0:32:00| you can't get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| Because I think, you know, the original, what we just heard was it was primarily for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| concerts, but I want people to be very clear, it's not limited to concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| It could be for any event held at Thompson Bowling where the decision is made to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| the secure entrance outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| And there would be nothing to prevent permanently changing that, doing beer gardens, doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1944)|
| 0:32:30| whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| I mean, I'm not saying I'm opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| I just want us to be clear that what we're doing is not just based on one business line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1957)|
| 0:32:44| This could forever alter that because it would just alter the amount of space that the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1964)|
| 0:32:53| covers now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| And my apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| I was trying to give more of a specific example of the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I'm not saying that you were trying to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| I just want people to watch this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| They hear this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1984)|
| 0:33:05| It's been in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| What are they doing at Thompson Bowling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| There's beer going to be everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| I just want for on the record, as my attorney friends say, this is really kind of what could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| happen from now on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Councilman Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Vice Mayor Smith, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| I just want to make sure I'm hearing this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| The ticketing will start where the parking lot meets the ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| Is that how I should visualize this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| On both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| But, you know, in our printout, the color of the cement changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| I'm just making sure I have the right marker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| So also for accuracy's sake for the public as well and for us, I don't think any of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| graphics are in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| And I would even like for the record to see these outlined, if that's possible, so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2035)|
| 0:34:01| we can all be on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2041)|
| 0:34:03| That would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| I have a pretty rough outline that I can provide to you all that includes the marking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| That's better than, yeah, I think that's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Ms. Hopper can include that with the minutes packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| I'll be happy to submit this with the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Yeah, thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| That's how I'm understanding this, and I want to make sure that it makes it into the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| And it indicates, of course, where the access points to the ramp are blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2066)|
| 0:34:33| I mean, the pink line is where the boundaries would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| And back to the question we had on the previous item, would this be sold just by Aramark employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2077)|
| 0:34:45| or volunteer groups would be able to sell out in this space as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| This is all going to be Aramark vendors, Aramark employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| I'm getting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Oh, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Mr. Byrd, I picked up on what Vice Mayor Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| From the paperwork, what was published in the paper, was there any indication, Mr. Byrd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| that this was outdoor area or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Because I was looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| We have basically floor plans for the inside of the arena, and there was nothing publicly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| noticed about the exterior of it, was there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| I mean, the documents that were submitted are what I have from the service plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2121)|
| 0:35:27| If I may, the application does reference adding entrance ramps to existing beer permit at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| Thompson Bowling Arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| I don't know if that was part of the public notice, but it is part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2137)|
| 0:35:38| I was just thrown by the photos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| It is clear that it's on the entrance ramps to existing beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| So we're all clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| We can get it in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| That'll make everybody feel better, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| I think the confusion is that the illustrations in the packet is, well, yeah, I mean, it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2154)|
| 0:36:04| these little corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| I know you might not be able to see mine, Mr. Elridge, but in our packet, it's page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2165)|
| 0:36:11| 400 that I'm looking at, and in your packet, I think it says sheet four of nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2171)|
| 0:36:19| That's of the architectural drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| Yeah, that's where it starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| It has these, so on that sheet four of nine from your architectural drawings, page 400| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| in our packet, it says ramp on one corner and beer garden and beer garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2194)|
| 0:36:42| They're very small areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| So that's what we publicly noticed were these very tiny squares at the corners of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2204)|
| 0:36:52| not the outdoor spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| Let me address that if I might, Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| So at the top, well, if you're holding page four of nine vertically, the beer garden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2218)|
| 0:37:09| that which is labeled beer garden, that's already in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| That's already covered under the existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| The reference to ramp and the outline where the entrance doors are are the same entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2236)|
| 0:37:27| doors that are referenced in our pictures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2247)|
| 0:37:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| So, Mr. Eldridge, did I get your last name correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Very close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| Eldridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Eldridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2257)|
| 0:37:38| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2258)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| So if I take your drawing, I don't know if you can see, because I'm sorry, I'm working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| with a pencil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| If I take your drawing of what was publicly noticed and this, that is what, can you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| that square?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| No, I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| That is what you're proposing in your packet to make your beer garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2274)|
| 0:37:58| No, it's broader than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| Would you pass the outline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2280)|
| 0:38:01| Sorry if I made...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| Oh, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| It's this whole area in these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I'm saying what was publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| If I look at this, it's very reasonable for me to say this is what you're publicly noticing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| So, I'm just, in fairness, I don't know, I'll defer to Mr. Frost if that's sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2294)|
| 0:38:23| to add it to the record afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| Well, I would, Councilwoman Ryder, I would go back to the application, as the Vice Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2306)|
| 0:38:39| pointed out, that it talks about adding entrance ramps to the existing permit at Thompson Bowling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| and the entrance ramps are the entrance ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| They are, I would respectfully submit that it would be clear from this application that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2333)|
| 0:39:02| there is a request to add the entrance ramps at Thompson Bowling to the existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2342)|
| 0:39:08| Mr. Frost, your feelings on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2348)|
| 0:39:13| On page 400, I do see two, you know, holding it vertically, I do see two areas outlined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| that say ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| So, that's what this is limited to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| And the ramp is the end of the wall where the full large ramp area meets the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| That's satisfactory documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| It's what they turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I don't know if it comports with the aerial photographs they passed out or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| What they turned in is what's being heard tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| What they turned in for the agenda packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Any other questions from anybody on the Beer Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2396)|
| 0:40:00| Council Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| I assume ticketing will be pushed to where the parking lot meets the ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Security will as well to make sure that people are ID'd there once they come down the ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| or have a beverage, they can't go back out to the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| Security will be pushed out to the perimeter as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2422)|
| 0:40:23| If there is a question about notice, obviously, then we would take whatever the description is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2423)|
| 0:40:35| that if there's a concern about whether there was sufficient notice given about the extent to which the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| then we would ask that the ramp that is described in page 400, actually, yeah, 400,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2441)|
| 0:40:55| that the permit be expanded at least to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| But I would suggest that there has been notice that we're seeking a permit on the ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Mr. Eldridge, my additional question is the security, or Mr. Fabrizio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| the security that will be making sure that people don't walk out, come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2473)|
| 0:41:20| Can you explain who is the security that will be making sure that beer stays on premises?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2480)|
| 0:41:26| So that's the third-party access security contracted by the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2486)|
| 0:41:30| So essentially, the entire ticketing and security setup that is usually at the arena entrance doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| all of that equipment and that staff moves up to that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| So the doors at that point become just free-flow doors where the MAG security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2502)|
| 0:41:48| the security guards, and the ticket scanners are at those entrances to the ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| So the same perimeter that is typically established at those doors expands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| It has the same presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| So when the doors are the perimeter, as they are now prior to this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| those individuals at the door are checking tickets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| but they're also making sure people aren't walking out with beers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Two separate groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| So there's the university usher staff that scans all the tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| And then there is access security, which keeps anyone from entering, exiting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2537)|
| 0:42:22| making sure they're going through the bags,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| and also controlling the alcohol, leaving the arena as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| So they're just moving their service point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| And so the number of service points is actually going to diminish, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| Because right now, I can go to almost any of the doors around the perimeter of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2556)|
| 0:42:41| Essentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| I mean, they selectively decide which ones are going to be open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| but now it's more limited to the entrances to these two ramps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2568)|
| 0:42:52| Not just the two ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| So, again, a piece of that comes from what the event is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| and what the university determines for those entries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| But, again, on the aerial, typically the top of the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| but then the smaller ramp that winds up from below the parking garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| that would have a ticketing scanner mag added as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| But, essentially, all areas to enter that platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| and surface around the arena are completely secured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2595)|
| 0:43:20| So where you go from, say, one entrance, two sets of doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| now you only have one access point, but it's much, much larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| Gotcha. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| So they're essentially taking that entire staff group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| and moving the same mags and ticket scanners up to that new access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| Okay. All right. Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2620)|
| 0:43:41| Sergeant Taylor, do you have any additional questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Do you have your light on as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| I have lots of questions, but I'll try to limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| So, and maybe, Mr. Frost, I think you might have already alluded to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| On the agenda, it's a catering permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| but this sounds more like you're wanting a new premise permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| The first one was a catering permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| This one is to expand the premises at the arena only, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2648)|
| 0:44:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2652)|
| 0:44:13| But they're both…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Catering permit, we've already dealt with that, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| Is this not, they're not both applications for catering permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| No, no. This is just to expand the…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| Okay, then that was a mistype on my end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| Okay, does that change the certificate of occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| Expanding this out to the ramps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| You're going to fit a lot more people in there to drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| This is above my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| To my knowledge, the certificate of occupancy would stay the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| They're not admitting any more guests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| It's more just expanding the footprint of the concourse to reduce the congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| But the actual ticketed number of guests would not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| The certificate of occupancy still stays the same for the arena itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| Now, you talked about security at the end of the ramp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| so I guess where the ramp meets the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2703)|
| 0:45:08| Is that required to be a physical barrier in a catering event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| Like in a beer garden, normally there was a physical barrier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| not just a person there watching people come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2718)|
| 0:45:24| This, I don't believe, would fall under catering event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| because this would be our typical on-premise license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| But typically there is, for this, yes, a physical barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| So on either side of the security mags and the ticket scanners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| there's bike rack or cattle rack that block any other sort of access points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2736)|
| 0:45:44| I have no further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2745)|
| 0:45:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2747)|
| 0:45:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2751)|
| 0:45:52| Did you want to talk further, Mr. Eldridge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| I was about to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| I think I've addressed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| I mean, the long range is to make this venue a more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| it is designed to make it a more concert-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| and appealing for those that attend concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2776)|
| 0:46:20| It's more focused on concerts, but there is not a limit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| And from the city of Knoxville point of view,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| we would, of course, like those that are bringing large concerts to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| to want to continue to bring them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Mr. Eldridge, how many seats is the stadium, do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2793)|
| 0:46:37| Thompson Bowl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| The arena is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Mr. Fabrizio?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| The arena is roughly just under 23,000 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| But just depending on what the setup is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| On the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| Yes, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2810)|
| 0:46:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2811)|
| 0:46:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2812)|
| 0:46:53| I have been to a concert there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2813)|
| 0:46:54| even though it sounds like I don't know my way around the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2814)|
| 0:46:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2817)|
| 0:46:58| Any motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2818)|
| 0:46:59| I've got a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| Councilwoman Thomas, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Since there may be some ambiguity between the public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| and what was contained in the packet as far as the area to be served,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2829)|
| 0:47:14| would it be possible maybe to postpone this and let them amend the packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2834)|
| 0:47:19| to make sure that would remove the ambiguity from the service area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| that they are trying to expand to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2844)|
| 0:47:31| That's an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| What they applied for is what they applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| I don't know if what got handed out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| if that's more than what they submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| If that's more than what they submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2861)|
| 0:47:43| that's not what the beer board can approve tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2867)|
| 0:47:48| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| We would ask if there's a question about what we applied for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| we would obviously ask that that permit be expanded to the area that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| As shown in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2884)|
| 0:48:07| We would ask that what is shown in the packet be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2887)|
| 0:48:10| and if the additional aerials are not considered to be in the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| then we would ask just for what was considered in the packet with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| image and the drawings that were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2898)|
| 0:48:20| Sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| Man, you beat me to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| I've had my lie down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| Oh, Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| No, I was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2912)|
| 0:48:34| I was just going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| but you could always come back and then ask for it to be extended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| what you presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| Of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| Do you have a comment on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Well, we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| I'll second your motion, Tommy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I'm sorry, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2933)|
| 0:48:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| Councilman Ryder, your board chair has a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2938)|
| 0:48:59| So part of my issue is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| The packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| Our application process doesn't give you something clear to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| You just wrote in there, expand your service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| And then I see down here and part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| It's adding entrance ramps, but there's no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| Good description of what the perimeter is or what the entrance ramps are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I think ideally it should have been the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| The illustrations that were brought to tonight's meeting should have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| And Mr. Eldridge, I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| And Mr. Fabrizio to approve what's in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| I can't really tell from the drawings in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| They literally look like rectangles outside the doorways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2986)|
| 0:49:49| But that's clearly not what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| We're talking about this much larger area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2992)|
| 0:49:55| That goes beyond the rectangle drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| I mean, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3000)|
| 0:50:01| I'm not in opposition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| And I'm not sure it changes anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| The packet just didn't make it clear that we're talking about the whole ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3009)|
| 0:50:10| And I think that's what Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3012)|
| 0:50:13| Now everybody's got their hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3014)|
| 0:50:15| Well, you know, I will say there seems to be some ambiguity between the photos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| and some of the written material in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| But the application does say expanding to the ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3023)|
| 0:50:28| That actually is in the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| Now, you may not know that if you look at some of the visuals that was applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| So I think we could probably suffice with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3035)|
| 0:50:41| It may not be perfect as far as clarity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3041)|
| 0:50:44| but I think it probably does fit what we would need to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3044)|
| 0:50:50| Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| I was going to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I mean, the application says interest ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3054)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3059)|
| 0:51:00| Pictures are difficult, but they're asking for what they applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3060)|
| 0:51:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| Councilwoman Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I was going in the opposite direction, that if we have so many questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3067)|
| 0:51:12| I'd like to have clarity in the files before we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| So if it requires a postponement or if we can approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| I don't think we know exactly what's in the package to go ahead and approve that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| So for me, I would feel more comfortable waiting until everything is all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3083)|
| 0:51:28| and we're not questioning it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3088)|
| 0:51:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| So we have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| So at this point, we would vote because that's what we, I think, need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Anyone opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Two abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3117)|
| 0:52:02| I think we're past the two abstentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3125)|
| 0:52:06| Mr. Fabrizio, not to be scolding, but just better drawings next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3126)|
| 0:52:10| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Mr. Bird, please demand better drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| Look forward to some great concert there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| Should I submit these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| Our recorder here has that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| We actually have one agenda item to go back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| And I'm trying to even remember which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3163)|
| 0:52:44| Has anyone from Lonsdale Mart, 5th District, 3208 Rudy Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| Rudy Street, Lonsdale Market, Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3170)|
| 0:52:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| It appears no one has come from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| Mr. Bird, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| I can't explain his absence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3179)|
| 0:53:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3181)|
| 0:53:02| I haven't talked to him today or yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We were kind of on track with supplying documents and stuff last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-240416?start=3184)|
