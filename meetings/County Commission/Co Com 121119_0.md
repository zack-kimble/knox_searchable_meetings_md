| 0:08:20| Health Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| Okay, Sheriff's Department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=503)|

| 0:08:48| I'll turn this over to the commission for any other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| I have a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| How close, Codes, how close are they to that 500?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=533)|
| 0:08:59| Where are they at, Bill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| It's about 200 feet to the zone line, about 228 to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=540)|
| 0:09:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Mr. Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=550)|
| 0:09:11| Have you applied for a liquor license with the state, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| No, sir, not yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| Are you going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| We're going to apply for only wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| Do you realize that you can't get it without a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| You cannot get a beer license unless you have a liquor license based on where your store is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| I think we can get beer and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=569)|
| 0:09:30| There's no problem to get because if you had a liquor license, we had to put, I think, over 75 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=570)|
| 0:09:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| You can't have a beer license until you get your liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Does that make sense to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=579)|
| 0:09:40| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=580)|
| 0:09:41| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| We can take beer and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| All of the restaurants, they have beer and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| I know what you're saying, but you're not understanding me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=586)|
| 0:09:49| You can't have a beer license at that location unless the state grants you a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| Is that correct, Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| We can't authorize you to have a liquor license or a beer license until you have a liquor license because you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=596)|
| 0:10:03| unless you get a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| So we must have to apply for the liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| You must have the liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| We have this restaurant is around 54 seats or 56, so we can get liquor license with the 56 seats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=612)|
| 0:10:19| I don't know, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=619)|
| 0:10:20| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| I don't know what the liquor laws are, but you can't have a beer license because you're too close to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| I have next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=628)|
| 0:10:29| He has a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=629)|
| 0:10:30| He has a state liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=630)|
| 0:10:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Is that correct, Wolfie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| The Mexican restaurant beside him has to have a liquor license to have a beer license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=637)|
| 0:10:41| I don't think they don't have liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| They only have beer and that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| They have beer and I don't think they have a liquor license, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| It's their grandfather, Dan, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=648)|
| 0:10:50| But we can't grant you a beer license without you having a liquor license or a Board of Zoning Appeals variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=650)|
| 0:10:59| So, you know, if you want to delay this and look into your options, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=659)|
| 0:11:05| But we can't today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| We can't legally give you a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| If we apply for the liquor license, you can get with the 48 or 54 seats liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=669)|
| 0:11:13| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| I don't know what the liquor laws are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| Or wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| I don't know what the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Yeah, you're saying you can wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=679)|
| 0:11:21| You can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| We assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=684)|
| 0:11:25| This is not a state agency, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=685)|
| 0:11:26| But you can't get a beer license without a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| Without a beer or wine or liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=689)|
| 0:11:32| Does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| I mean, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| And so I'm going to make a motion to defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=694)|
| 0:11:40| and let you look into your options with Codes Enforcement and the State Liquor Board of Liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| So you give us 30 days to apply for the liquor license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=709)|
| 0:11:50| So then how long do you have to come again to this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=710)|
| 0:11:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| There's been first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| Mr. Law Director, will 30 days be enough time for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| Do we need to give him 60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=725)|
| 0:12:10| So how much time would he need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| Whatever he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| Or we can table it until he gets his liquor license and wants to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| You just want to amend it to 90?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=741)|
| 0:12:22| But we have, sir, so many restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=742)|
| 0:12:23| They have beer and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=743)|
| 0:12:24| They have no liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Sir, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| I don't know what the state laws are with liquor and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| But you can't have a beer permit without a liquor license because of where your building is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=751)|
| 0:12:38| So the motion is that we're going to defer it for 90 days if the second agrees to second agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| And that will give you more time to research it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| Larry, can we change it to 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Or if he gets it faster, he can bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Yes, second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=780)|

| 0:18:01| As we pause for just a second to reflect upon where we are and what we're doing this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1081)|
| 0:18:10| I've looked at a poem that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain, for purple mountains' majesty above the fruited plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1092)|
| 0:18:21| America, America, God shed his grace on thee and crown thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1101)|
| 0:18:33| This is the season when we best be thankful because we have it made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1113)|
| 0:18:40| We only have it that way because people have walked in front of us and done the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| I pray that we today be able to sit here and do what is best for our Knox County as we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1126)|
| 0:18:57| I say that with open eyes and say amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| At this time, we'll have the pledge led by Commissioner Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| You would rise and face the flag, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1148)|

| 0:19:40| Thank you for paying attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1184)|

| 0:19:59| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| Lots are all messed up on this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| I'm sorry I had to miss the luncheon and the beer board today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| but I had a three-month previous commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| I understand that there was a discussion on the overcrowding at the jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1211)|
| 0:20:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Did that discussion get finished, or is there something we need to add on a discussion item today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| It pretty well got finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| We're looking into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1223)|
| 0:20:24| We're on top of it, and the sheriff's going to get back with us on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| He mentioned your name on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1227)|
| 0:20:29| It was very timely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| So we will hear back from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1232)|
| 0:20:34| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| I want to check with the law director on 903-1103 on page 10 in regards to the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| We've talked about tabling that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| Have we taken all the measures we need to take on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| And if the two administrations do not agree, what do we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| Do we come back at that time, or do we wait until July of next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| We just want to make sure we got the wording correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1258)|
| 0:21:05| Use your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1265)|
| 0:21:12| The actual word tabling, it means you have to bring it back with a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| That may you may want to defer it pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1277)|
| 0:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I want to take that off consent, Larry, until we count it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1285)|
| 0:21:27| Anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| And that was 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1288)|
| 0:21:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1290)|
| 0:21:32| Anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1295)|
| 0:21:36| It deals with 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| I heard that while I was gone that we're going to have a workshop dealing with the billboards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| And I guess it will be after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1304)|
| 0:21:46| And, you know, just with, you know, this is something that's been going on for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1306)|
| 0:21:50| We're getting into the holiday season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1310)|
| 0:21:53| It's only going to be probably less than two weeks from the time we have the workshop till we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1313)|
| 0:21:58| till we would be voting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Will we be better off going ahead and deferring this into the January meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| And that's really what I would prefer to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| And that's not on consent today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| So we'll talk about it at a regular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1329)|
| 0:22:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1330)|
| 0:22:11| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| I've been asked to from the school superintendent for 802 to pull that off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| They want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| We'll address that at the proper time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| So at this point we have pulled from the agenda 802, 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| Anything else for commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| All in favor of pulling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| The motion to add, defer, change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| Do I hear a motion to add, defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1369)|

| 0:24:41| Drives and roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| On page two, consideration of the closure of a portion of Woods Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| Closure is approximately 420 feet in length beginning at the intersection of Darby Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| and terminating at the dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| Property owner is Todd Claiborne, and this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1495)|
| 0:24:59| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| I'd like to call on Jim Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| I think we need to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| This is in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| I'd like to ask a couple of questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| I know this is closing from an intersection on further into property owned by this Claiborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1512)|
| 0:25:22| Where the street is closing is an intersection with a right-hand turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| I'd ask you before, I think, to does Claiborne own both sides of the road even before it gets to that intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1527)|
| 0:25:35| Jim Snowden, 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| No, Commissioner Wright, he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| And I actually spoke to his surveyor this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| And there's a home on the other side that he does not control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| And that person's driveway comes out on the Darby Road side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| So it would be somewhat difficult to create an alignment that would create a curve rather than an intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1548)|
| 0:25:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| I'm asking this question because if there could be a radiused curve in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| this Darby Road is used in clement weather by people to get off of a ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| the far side of which freezes up and they can't get off of easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1565)|
| 0:26:10| And I just wondered if the property owner had property on both sides of the road before we got to the turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1570)|
| 0:26:19| It's not that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| I have no opposition to this road closure and move that it be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| It's been properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1588)|

| 0:26:31| I need to abstain from the vote, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1591)|

| 0:33:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=1992)|

| 0:33:45| Moving properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| Anybody here who wants to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Barbara, do you want to come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| I'm Barbara Monte, director of the Knoxville-Knox County CAC, Office on Aging and Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2037)|
| 0:34:08| And I apologize for my voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| I've got laryngitis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2051)|
| 0:34:13| If you need a voice, we'll ask Karen to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| We are just really grateful for this contract, and we know a lot of folks are going to get where they need to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I said I wanted to make a comment on Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| For $500,000, me personally, I was not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| But the way this contract reads now is it's going to be you're going to, as you use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| so you will not use the full $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| I just wanted our audience to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2079)|
| 0:34:41| So I was thinking let's go $250,000 to $300,000, take the other $200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| and give our county employees a $1,000 raise apiece if we had that kind of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2085)|
| 0:34:49| But if we use it as we go, I think I do not have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I think it should be quite a bit less than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| And Chris Caldwell is going to keep us up as to how that money is being funded on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| You know, I just have a question because I think what we're trying to accomplish with this by giving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| you know, the seniors rides to places, it's important for their socialization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| We need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2114)|
| 0:35:15| Some of the stuff is critical we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| I know there's dialysis patients and people that have medical appointments that we have to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| My only question about all of this is how you can serve the most people with the amount of money that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2121)|
| 0:35:29| And it really deals with are we better off doing it this way as far as what it costs per person to transport people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2129)|
| 0:35:37| or can we serve more people if we used things like taxi vouchers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| And I know this is something that, you know, maybe this isn't the time to look at all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| But in the future, you know, there are certain things that those vans that go around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| They're bigger than vans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| I don't know what you call them, minibuses or whatever, can provide because they can lift wheelchairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| They can provide assistance that obviously taxis can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| But some of the services that CAC is providing, you know, with this senior transportation services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2159)|
| 0:36:06| are things that could be done, you know, with a taxi cab on short rides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| And to me, which the question that I have about this, which is the most cost effective so we can serve the most people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| with the amount of money we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| And I don't know if you're going to be able to answer that or if anyone could answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2182)|
| 0:36:27| But it's something that I think at some point we need to look at is how we can get the biggest bang for the buck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| We actually have a committee working on taxi service, making it wheelchair accessible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2193)|
| 0:36:41| making it more, have more oversight in that more of the, more screening of the drivers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2201)|
| 0:36:50| better training of the drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| And we would suggest that Knox County take a look at providing some oversight for the taxi service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2212)|
| 0:37:02| outside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Because right now, the only taxi oversight is through the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2224)|
| 0:37:10| Yeah, I'm not, when I'm talking about this, I'm not talking about for some of the wheelchair patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2230)|
| 0:37:16| or some of the patients that have, or I should say citizens that have special needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| because they may only be able to serve with what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| But I'm talking about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| And when we were talking about this, about people who need a ride just down to the senior center to play cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| who want to have a ride, you know, someplace for some of these socialization issues that we talk about that are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2252)|
| 0:37:39| And these are people who can, I mean, you know, who can get in a cab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| Maybe they ought not be out driving, but they could get into a cab and get a ride down to the senior center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| or get around, get a ride down to the church, you know, where they can meet with other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2271)|
| 0:37:58| But, you know, I guess we could look at, can taxi cabs and taxi cab drivers deal with handicapped patients?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2278)|
| 0:38:06| Well, it's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| I'm concerned that we don't have enough background checks on the drivers to make sure that they are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2289)|
| 0:38:21| I mean, I'm not saying they're not, but we do not have the kind of oversight of the drivers themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2301)|
| 0:38:30| to transport anybody, let alone people with handicaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| So I would like to see us looking at that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| I think vouchers are the way of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2317)|
| 0:38:40| I think we've got to find a way to do that because it is more responsive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2320)|
| 0:38:45| and it should be hopefully less expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| But I think first we have to deal with the oversight of the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2334)|
| 0:38:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2337)|
| 0:38:58| And I was just going to make that point, so I definitely won't belabor it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| But I'll say, you know, before we fund some things like that, I think that's a noble suggestion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2342)|
| 0:39:09| but there are all kinds of liability issues associated with it, and the county just doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| I mean, when someone outside the city shows up to your house, I mean, you don't know the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2354)|
| 0:39:20| And if something unfortunate happens, you have an irresponsible driver or someone, you know, with a record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| all those lines will lead back to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| So until we get our ducks in a row for that, I think it is, as Barbara said, it is the wave of the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2370)|
| 0:39:39| But there are certain things that we'll need to do up front to make sure that we're not going to be in a bad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2379)|
| 0:39:46| position or be, you know, held with a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| So, you know, that's why nothing's ever easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| One, nothing's ever easy when you're dealing with seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| And nothing's ever easy when you're talking about handling members of the public who are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2397)|
| 0:40:05| a bit more delicate than several of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| So there's added costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| And I know Commissioner Shouse was illustrating some of the, you know, numbers and some of the, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2410)|
| 0:40:16| there are large numbers per transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| But it's – I'd rather spend, you know, 30, 40 percent more per ride and be assured that we're going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2420)|
| 0:40:30| care of our seniors and our people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| So – and then the other thing I'd like to point out is that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| the piece of going to play cards or bingo, I think we've had a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| That's not what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| These folks are not going to be going to the Senior Citizen Center for a bingo night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2446)|
| 0:40:50| That's not what this money is set aside for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| This is to transport our constituents who can least afford and are able to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2453)|
| 0:41:02| That's what this money is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| And that gets to Commissioner Smith's point is that number is what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| And we're going to do it by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| And if at the end of the year we have extra money, we have extra money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| We'll deal with that at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Barbara, can you address that when he was talking about going for the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| going for the bingo trips and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| Just reassure the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2480)|
| 0:41:23| We understand that the funds that were allocated are specifically to give medical trips a priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2483)|
| 0:41:32| We will also, if you agree, approve some essential errands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| getting people to the food stamp office to apply for food stamps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| But we had not intended to use this for social and recreational trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Yeah, I was just wanting to make sure everybody was clear on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| because there have been comments made all through this process about it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| CAC does provide those trips, but it's funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| That's funded through a different program from the federal government that they get money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| And that's for socialization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| That's not what this is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| And I would really – you know, one of the reasons that we've kind of struggled with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| and not handled it, I think, very efficiently is that CAC is a very large organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2536)|
| 0:42:24| and they provide a lot of services to Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| And I would like to encourage all of us to be more educated about all the things that CAC does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| and especially about – you know, they are Knox County's public transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2557)|
| 0:42:42| CAC is Knox County's public transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| And there was some misunderstanding about that, too, during all of this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| And I hope that, as this gets rolling, that – you know, I know there are some of us who routinely do ride-alongs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2571)|
| 0:42:57| with the KPD or with the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| And I think it would be great if we did some ride-alongs with CAC just to see how this money is being spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2581)|
| 0:43:09| and the effect that it has on the lives of our seniors who most need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Or is it Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Who has their line on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| This side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| A good question was brought up about background checks on the taxi drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2604)|
| 0:43:31| That's something that our law department can check with our law department and see what kind of rules they put out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2611)|
| 0:43:37| You know, we can go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2617)|
| 0:43:38| I'd be glad to do that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2618)|
| 0:43:42| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Barbara, I've known you for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| And I think, you know, you're very frugal with money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| And so if you can save the taxpayers money or come up with another way, then, you know, just keep us informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| Because I don't think you treat it as your money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2633)|
| 0:43:55| You just know that you've got so much money to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| And if you can find a better way to do it, you'll get more rides out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| And we will be very careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| And we probably will not spend all of the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| We'll be glad to let you decide what to do with what's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2650)|
| 0:44:11| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2653)|
| 0:44:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| Like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2656)|
| 0:44:18| And one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2658)|
| 0:44:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2659)|
| 0:44:27| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2667)|
| 0:44:28| Page 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2668)|
| 0:44:31| This is a resolution to determine the method of disposal of property located at 7215 Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| to be by public auction and providing for said property to be subdivided and rezoned according to its heights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| and the best use prior to its sale by public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| Resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2694)|
| 0:44:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Dr. McIntyre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| Mr. Chairman, thank you for the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| You have in your possession a letter from Ms. Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| who is the chair of the school board requesting a deferral on this item for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| I believe it's related to the larger issue of property ownership of properties owned by the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2711)|
| 0:45:18| and how they are titled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2718)|
| 0:45:20| And we've gotten some great guidance from the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| but I think it bears some additional conversation and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| The school board intends to bring perhaps some proposals or recommendations for action to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| in the time frame of another 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| So she has written to the chair to respectfully request a deferral of 90 days on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2737)|
| 0:45:44| Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2744)|
| 0:45:45| Mr. Law Director, we've been in discussion about this for four or five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| and they dropped a letter on us the day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| What discussion has your office had with the school board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| And where did this property come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| And how do we do a little history on the property, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2759)|
| 0:46:07| The general discussion that I've had with the school superintendent has to do with the old city schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2767)|
| 0:46:15| When they were transferred to Knox County, they were titled to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2775)|
| 0:46:20| but they were not titled to the Knox County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| There were other properties that have been purchased since that have been titled to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2784)|
| 0:46:30| and not titled to the Knox County School Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| There's statutorial directions from the state as it relates to title of property, surplus of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2794)|
| 0:46:45| and where the money goes as it relates to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| There's also the general titles of property as the money goes as it relates to county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2810)|
| 0:46:59| And the question that has been brought to the law department was who owns the particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| I forgot, superintendent, how many properties, but there were several, 50, 60 pieces, maybe more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2825)|
| 0:47:12| and who has proper title and what was the original intent and et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| So I had the department do title searches and evaluate those properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| And I advised the superintendent as to the proper title and who, how, what, when currently now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2842)|
| 0:47:29| And that's the discussions that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| What about this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Where did it fall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| This property is currently titled and owned by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| How did we come into contact with the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| I believe that came with the Bearden Middle School purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| But it was titled separately from the school property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Here's my only issue with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| We've had to try to we've talked, had discussion about this property for three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| And, you know, the last two or three properties we've gotten back from the school system, respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| have cost us a lot of money, Oakwood School, South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| Just to stabilize them, once we get them to that, we get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2887)|
| 0:48:11| We're having to spend money on them once you all have turned them back over to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| If we're talking about this one piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| this discussion should have been had two or three months ago when we talked about selling this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| And, Mr. Chairman and Commissioner, respectfully, that conversation has been ongoing for two or three months since it came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| to the attention of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2913)|
| 0:48:36| And that conversation has been ongoing with the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2916)|
| 0:48:39| It's been a conversation we've been having with the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2919)|
| 0:48:41| It may not have been a conversation we've had with individual commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| but it's been an ongoing dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| Well, and, you know, the issue is that we're talking about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Right now, we're just talking about one property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| Nothing else is up for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| So, and my point on this property is I think we ought to go ahead and sell this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| and have discussion about the rest of the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2938)|
| 0:49:01| Because, you know, the last two properties we've gotten back from you guys and had to sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| we've had to give Oakwood School, I believe we've spent, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| $300,000 or $400,000 on it to stabilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| And so once you guys get around to turning them back over to us, you hand us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| when we get rural high school, it's not going to be a pretty bill for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| And so, you know, I want to have that discussion on down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2961)|
| 0:49:26| but we're so far into this one property that's not going to make a difference in anybody's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| about what we're going to do with this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2971)|
| 0:49:34| You know, I mean, this conversation should have been had with individual commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| or as a commission body two or three months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| instead of us sending a letter the day before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2980)|
| 0:49:44| Again, Commissioner, respectfully, this has been on the commission's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2984)|
| 0:49:48| It's been deferred twice, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2988)|
| 0:49:50| And it's been a topic of conversation with the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| It's been a topic of conversation with the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2994)|
| 0:49:56| I don't think this is something that was dropped on anyone at the last minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| I think it's been an ongoing dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| And it's a request from the school board chair to defer the item for a time certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3003)|
| 0:50:09| so that we can continue the conversation and make sure that we bring it to clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| I think there's a broader issue around and a larger issue around the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| about the properties that are school properties and how they're titled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3018)|
| 0:50:23| And I think it just, I think it bears some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| And I think it would be in the interest of both the commission and the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| to have that full conversation and bring some clarity to the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| before this particular property is disposed of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3035)|
| 0:50:44| Mr. Chair, Mr. Commissioner, Sam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3044)|
| 0:50:48| Yeah, yeah, that guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| You know, I'm looking at this, the timing of this, and this latest development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3052)|
| 0:51:03| with maybe a little more, I guess I'll say apprehension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| And that's because, as Commissioner Anders said, I mean, we've been down this road before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3070)|
| 0:51:18| with two properties that cost us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| Looking at this particular property, looking at the traffic count, quite honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3080)|
| 0:51:24| looking at the location, you know, I'm looking at this property as one that won't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3084)|
| 0:51:32| the amount of investment than we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3092)|
| 0:51:36| Maybe it will be, you know, go the other direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3096)|
| 0:51:39| And to be quite honest, I mean, you know, when we look, when we, I guess we took this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| when we acquired the city school systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3103)|
| 0:51:48| And the county spent a lot of money since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| I mean, if you look at takes and puts, the county's put a lot more in than it's taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| So, I mean, I mean the county, I don't mean the school system budget, but the county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| And so, you know, the, as you say, Commissioner, I mean, as you say, Superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| you've been talking about this for months and months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| And this is what you came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| You came up with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3132)|
| 0:52:14| Okay, so, and then we got this 11th hour change, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| Well, when I say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| Commissioner, respectfully, the resolution did not come from the Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| This was put on the, this item was put on the Knox County Commission Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| excuse me, agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3150)|
| 0:52:32| And when we received the agenda, this was, I think, two or three months ago when we received the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| that was our notification that it was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3159)|
| 0:52:41| This is a property that is, as the law director's office has mentioned, is titled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| the title on this property is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| But this is a property that, at least up until 2007, was leased by the Board of Education to an outside entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3171)|
| 0:52:58| And as recently as a year ago, notification was made to the State Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3178)|
| 0:53:05| that this was a property that was held by the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| as a potential underutilized property for the purposes of a statute related to charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| So, I mean, again, I think that this is a resolution that came on the County Commission's agenda, not by our doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3196)|
| 0:53:24| It was a resolution that came on something as a surprise to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| And for a property that they believe that they owned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| And, again, we've worked through some of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| I think the law director's been terrific to work with in terms of providing us some guidance and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3214)|
| 0:53:39| But I think the chair of the school board believes that an additional deferral would be beneficial to all parties involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3219)|
| 0:53:46| in order to make sure that we are working together and collaborating around these issues of property and land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3226)|
| 0:53:53| and making sure that we get to the best end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3233)|
| 0:53:55| Commissioner Anders made reference to a couple of the properties that we have surplused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| We're in the process of talking about Rule High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| We're in the process of talking about Historic Knox High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| We want to make sure that we are in conversation and collaboration with the County Commission on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| And I think there's just a broader question about property ownership that I think needs to be clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| And I think the board believes needs to be clarified before we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| I don't think there's a huge downside necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| And you may disagree to deferring for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| But I think there would be a pretty substantial advantage in terms of clarifying the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3266)|
| 0:54:32| and being able to come back to the County Commission with some additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| and perhaps even a proposal about how we move forward with some of the properties going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| I'll just give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| The property that was bought at North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3283)|
| 0:54:45| We're building a new school at North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3285)|
| 0:54:48| That property, while it was purchased with dollars that were allocated to the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3288)|
| 0:54:54| and was purchased on behalf of the Board of Education, is currently titled in the name Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3294)|
| 0:54:59| And I think there's just some opportunity to bring some clarity to this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| to provide some more information in this conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| and perhaps propose a resolution to some of the challenges that it poses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| And my last words on that, I don't disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| I think we have something here before us that looks valid and reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| So I'll be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you, Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3325)|
| 0:55:26| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3326)|
| 0:55:27| I share or I understand Commissioner Andrews' concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| I look at some of the properties, the Oakwood, which actually, for all these years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| some good things have happened out there or about to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| I look at Fair Garden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| You know, some good things happened there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| It's sort of a puzzle to get these old buildings and figure out what to do with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3342)|
| 0:55:47| Sometimes when they're in neighborhoods, they're gentrifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3347)|
| 0:55:50| It's easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| Sometimes it's a heck of a puzzle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| But this is a --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3354)|
| 0:55:55| I'm pretty familiar with this piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| It's right there at Von Osdale and Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| It's catty-cornered to Shenandale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| To the west of it is a convenient mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| There's a church, I guess, to the south of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3365)|
| 0:56:08| Nevertheless, it would be a valuable piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3372)|
| 0:56:13| It's way, way, way below the best use for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| I see no reason to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3379)|
| 0:56:23| I'm with Dr. McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3383)|
| 0:56:24| I don't see a reason to not give them the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3384)|
| 0:56:28| I'd rather dot the I's and cross the T's and hopefully get this thing back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3388)|
| 0:56:36| You said you would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| Would you support the motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| Which is to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| Well, I would make a substitute that we give a 90-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| I don't think we have anything to lose with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3411)|
| 0:56:53| So I would make a substitute for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| We have a substitute and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| We still have lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3422)|
| 0:57:03| Commissioner Brules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| I agree that in the past there have been some serious problems with surplusing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| Brownlow School, which is in my neighborhood, comes to mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3430)|
| 0:57:13| Oakwood School, which is in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| Rural, which is on the edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| And historic Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| But this conversation that at least I've had with several school board members going back, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| longer than a year, that we need a better process for surplusing those before they get so dilapidated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3445)|
| 0:57:33| and end up costing us so much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And I think that what I've seen out of the school board recently has been an effort to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3457)|
| 0:57:43| which I greatly appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3463)|
| 0:57:45| I think we're seeing that happen with Historic High and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| My ---- I support seconded Ed's substitute motion because the other concern I have about this is our relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3469)|
| 0:57:58| with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| And if we sent, made a request to another legislative body asking them to defer something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| so that we could take a different look at it or a closer look at it, we would expect them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3487)|
| 0:58:12| out of professional courtesy, unless, you know, there were lives at stake or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| that they would do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| We have tried very hard over the last year to forge a better working relationship with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3499)|
| 0:58:27| And that's another reason why I would like to or why I support Ed's substitute motion to defer this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| is that just out of professional courtesy and a desire to have a better working relationship with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3513)|
| 0:58:40| I think we can get there better by collaborating than pointing fingers back and forth at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Yeah, can you come down and kind of clarify the whole situation for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| You know, why it's on the, how it got to the agenda and why it's on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3533)|
| 0:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| Hugh Holt, 1,000 North Central Purchasing Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| This piece of property was brought before you with three other parcels that we sold last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3542)|
| 0:59:08| We got these properties from Child and Family Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| They've had them for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| And they decided they had no need for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3553)|
| 0:59:18| A couple of months ago, the Commission decided to carve this one out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| and let the law department and the schools try to work through these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| And that's where we're at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| And in Oakwood, it's 712,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Anything else, Mr. Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Are we just trying to determine who gets the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| Is that basically what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| I mean, is that the argument as to who gets the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| I mean, if they want to have, I mean, I agree with Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| If they want to have a relationship, we need to have a relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| But if you've got an issue, come talk to your commissioners about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| They're going to vote on the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| And so, I mean, is that basically what we're doing, is who gets the money from this sale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3596)|
| 0:59:59| Is that how we're discussing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3599)|
| 1:00:01| Commissioner, Mr. Chairman, I think that's really just a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| I think there's a broader issue of the question of property ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| and whose name is on the titles of school properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3611)|
| 1:00:16| And I think there's just a broader concern and an interest in bringing clarity to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| Again, if this is a property that the school board thought that it owned until very recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3623)|
| 1:00:30| and it's being sold by the county commission without an action of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| that's, I think, a worrisome precedent from the perspective of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| And so if there can be some clarity brought to the situation over a period of 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3639)|
| 1:00:44| I think that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| And I think that's really what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| And so, you know, yes, this is a valuable piece of property and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| But it may not, you know, the ultimate resolution may simply be we come back and say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| okay, we agree with the assessment that this is a county property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3660)|
| 1:01:05| and it's perfectly appropriate for it to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3665)|
| 1:01:08| But maybe on some other properties we would recommend some changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| or a quick claim deed or something of that nature to make sure that the title reflects the ownership of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3673)|
| 1:01:20| in the name of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| Mr. Aldrich, where do you --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| Who did the child and family have the lease with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Purchasing has that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| I believe it was with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| I can't swear to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| That was a little before my time, so I'll have to defer to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3699)|
| 1:01:43| I've only seen one lease, the child and family services, and it was with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3703)|
| 1:01:47| They say there's another lease that exists, but I don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| Well, I'm not going to sit here and battle over the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| But if next time that we surplus a school property, it costs us $700,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3719)|
| 1:02:03| I think it ought to come out of your capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| I mean, if we're going to let them get that ruined, then I think the school system ought to pay for it instead of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3725)|
| 1:02:10| We've built those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3730)|
| 1:02:11| We've bought or built those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| And then we had to turn around and let them sit and let the roof deteriorate and the engineering work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| And then we had to put the $700,000 bill for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| So, I mean, if we're going to let the school system, and it sounds like a battle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| if we're going to let them let them sit, then they can pay to bring them back up to structure before they sell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| And so, I mean, if the commission wants to defer this, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3751)|
| 1:02:36| Either way, we're going to probably sell it in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| So I don't know that we lose anything, like Commissioner Schall said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| But I think the process that we've used this time has been pretty flawed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3762)|
| 1:02:47| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3767)|
| 1:02:48| I agree with quite a few of those comments that you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3768)|
| 1:02:51| I've been singing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3771)|
| 1:02:53| This time our Deputy Law Director needs to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Mr. Hammond, we'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| But our Deputy Law Director wants to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| I'm stepping out of my role in the Law Director's Office to answer a question that Commissioner Anders had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| because I was deeply involved in litigation back in the late 80s and early 90s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3789)|
| 1:03:14| when the city decided to get out of the school business and dumped everything on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| There were numerous lawsuits which I was involved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| And at the time when the city dumped everything that was in the city schools on the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3803)|
| 1:03:31| the county was required under law and under court cases to assume all liabilities, including run-down buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3811)|
| 1:03:40| The biggest item that they had to assume that the county taxpayers had to take over was the unfunded liability of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3820)|
| 1:03:48| city teacher's pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| That was a tremendous hit on the county at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| At the time that the properties were transferred from the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| they were not with the City of Knoxville Board of Education at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| but the City of Knoxville directly to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| And part of all of that was that Knox County was having to assume all of this liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3846)|
| 1:04:16| The Board of Education for Knox County, Knox County, the City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| were all involved in those negotiations and those transfers of property which were then sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| some of them showing in those deeds back in the early 90s for $1,000 for this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| I think what we're talking about that Mr. Holt has on the agenda for sale were purchased, as I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3873)|
| 1:04:42| $1,000 per property titled specifically in the name of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3882)|
| 1:04:48| So to answer your question, Commissioner Anders, how did we get this particular property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| That's how it came about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| And I say that not as a law director, but as a witness who was there in the middle of all that back what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3897)|
| 1:05:05| 22 years ago, 23 years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3905)|
| 1:05:07| So this was all negotiated between the City of Knoxville County and the County School Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3907)|
| 1:05:13| Everybody was involved in that, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| And that's the reason some of the properties are historically in County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| not Southwest Middle or Elementary, obviously, because that one was just recent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| That's recent, but all those back then in the early 90s, they were all negotiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3922)|
| 1:05:28| and they were specifically put in the name of Knox County, for which Knox County paid either a sum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3928)|
| 1:05:35| like $1,000 or just the fact that they had to assume these tremendous liabilities that came with Victor Ashe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| deciding to get out of the school business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3942)|
| 1:05:44| Did the school, did the Knox County school system lose, did they have to fund any of those liabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3944)|
| 1:05:49| or was it all on the county dime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3949)|
| 1:05:51| It was all on the county dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3951)|
| 1:05:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| Just one correction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3956)|
| 1:05:57| It was Kyle Testament's administration when the school came out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| I just want to make sure we were correct there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| It might be written up if you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Mr. Holt, quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| Is there any problem with delaying this 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3973)|
| 1:06:17| It doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3977)|
| 1:06:18| There's no problem from an administrative standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| I was at a meeting the other night and it was explained to me that a dialogue is more than two monologues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3983)|
| 1:06:29| You'll be hearing me say that a lot because that really hit me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| And I think going to your point about our relationship with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| I think we do a great job of talking at each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| We don't do a good job of talking with each other and listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| And that's something that I'd like to see us do a better job of as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4003)|
| 1:06:47| But I'm going to support the deferral because there's no reason not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| I mean, if there was some overriding reason, if there was some issue, there apparently is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| So I'd like to give them an opportunity to have the 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| And let's come back and see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4018)|
| 1:07:02| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| I'd like to build for just a second on Commissioner Hammond's comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4025)|
| 1:07:12| because my question has to do with what will change in the next 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4032)|
| 1:07:19| If this is county, if the law department is saying this is county property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4039)|
| 1:07:30| I do not understand what might change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| But then the second thing, way before my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| but maybe this was during a time of Commissioner Hammond's tenure here on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4057)|
| 1:07:48| or Commissioner Shouse may remember this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| there was a developer that tried to purchase this piece of property in years gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| And I was kind of under the impression that that developer was dealing with commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4075)|
| 1:08:02| not with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| So that maybe if that's the way it was then, if that was correct back then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4084)|
| 1:08:13| that whoever is going to purchase this is going to be purchasing from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| as opposed to the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| So we've had it before us, you know, like for the 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4101)|
| 1:08:27| I'm not really opposed to seeing it drug out further,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4107)|
| 1:08:30| but if there's no apparent change in the outcome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4110)|
| 1:08:36| then I might be more willing for it to be disposed of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| You know, reading the room, I'm going to support the deferral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4126)|
| 1:08:52| but the reason I'm really not liking this is the obvious one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| I guess I just, you know, as I said, there was, and it wasn't only schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4139)|
| 1:09:04| I mean, the county took a lot on its plate when that fateful decision was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4144)|
| 1:09:10| I think we're doing a pretty good job with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| So it can be the right decision, but, you know, here we are 22 years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| and we're trying to, in my opinion, look like maybe cherry pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4158)|
| 1:09:23| And I just, you know, I just take issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4163)|
| 1:09:27| And it needs to be a dialogue between the school board and the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| but it needs to be a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4171)|
| 1:09:32| It doesn't need to be an 11th hour letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4172)|
| 1:09:36| It needs to be a dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| Months ago, you said a month or two ago, okay, it wasn't your resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| but we've had this dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4181)|
| 1:09:43| I mean, school board to commission, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Those two district folks maybe need to get together or get with the at-large people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| If we're going to have this dialogue, it needs to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| I just, again, I'm not going to change my opinion in this 60, 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4194)|
| 1:10:01| whatever the substitute motion was, unless I hear some extremely compelling argument as to why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4201)|
| 1:10:09| if that is, in fact, the case, that the school board wants the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| or wants the autonomy to sell to a user of their choosing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| I'm going to need to hear a pretty good argument, you know, along that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| And really, I'm just, I would like for the school board to get into a dialogue with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| and not put edicts out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| So I'm not, I'm hopefully wrong in my opinion that this is a cherry-picking action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| I'll stand here in front of this mic and admit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| Once we have that dialogue, once, you know, school board members contact me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| and get into a conversation with me about that, I'd be glad to sit here and profusely apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| But that's really what it looks like today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| So I'll support the delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4255)|

| 1:12:29| Point of order again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| You didn't call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| You didn't announce the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4351)|
| 1:12:32| So it's not a valid vote yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4352)|

| 1:13:43| Next item, clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4423)|
| 1:13:50| On page 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4430)|
| 1:13:56| Resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| One, directing the Knox County Finance Director to, subject to Knox County City Council's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4441)|

| 1:14:19| paying the full rate and $30 for those employees paying the 50% rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4459)|
| 1:14:24| And two, requesting the city county PBA parking committee to reconvene, subject to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4464)|
| 1:14:31| City Council's action of saying, as recommended in the city county PBA parking committee report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| dated May 18, 2010, to review the parking rate and structure and other matters affecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4478)|
| 1:14:43| parking policies and submit its findings and recommendations to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4483)|
| 1:14:48| city council, board of education, and PBA board of directors for their consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| and approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| This is resolution 903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| Do I hear a motion to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| You've been first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4498)|
| 1:14:59| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4499)|
| 1:15:04| The question would be whether or not we want to table it and make sure we've got that wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| So this is a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| I'd like to make a motion we table this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| For two reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| One reason, let the mayors have, administrations have time to look at it and come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| And also for the salary survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| I think that was the discussion we had the other day to let the salary survey come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| with some parking rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Table or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4532)|
| 1:15:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Table or defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4536)|
| 1:15:37| Table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4537)|
| 1:15:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| July, minimum of July of 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| Do you have a heartburn with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4544)|
| 1:15:54| Point of order, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| Can you table for a set amount of time or do you just table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| Basically you table it and it takes a two-third vote to bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| You can bring it back at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| Change the word to defer then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| That way it doesn't take two-thirds to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| You're going to defer until July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4573)|
| 1:16:15| 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4576)|
| 1:16:17| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4577)|
| 1:16:20| Until July when?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4580)|
| 1:16:21| 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| Okay, Commissioner Boers, you want to speak on the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Yeah, I don't have a problem with letting our mayors get together and discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4586)|
| 1:16:33| But I do have a problem with not having the employees be part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4593)|
| 1:16:39| The salary survey, my understanding is that it's not going to include any information on parking rates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| either in other parts of downtown Knoxville or in other areas that we're going to be comparing ourselves with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| So I'm not sure how that's going to have a big effect on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4612)|
| 1:16:57| And I don't mind deferring it, but, again, I would like to see, in January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| come back and have a we don't want the same committee, have some committee made up of stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4623)|
| 1:17:09| who actually are going to be paying this, citizens and employees of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4629)|
| 1:17:15| and the county to come together and be part of this decision-making process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| Chairman Norman can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4640)|
| 1:17:21| I mean, he can appoint any committee that he wants to, and that suggestion can be made to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4641)|
| 1:17:27| I just wanted to be clear that I'm not willing to defer all of this until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| I still want a committee of stakeholders to meet and be part of this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4651)|
| 1:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4659)|
| 1:17:40| We have a motion to table before it's been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| Motion to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4665)|
| 1:17:47| I said defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| I said table to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4670)|
| 1:17:54| Motion to defer until July the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4674)|

| 1:18:31| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| We approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Then I'll speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4714)|
| 1:18:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4716)|
| 1:18:37| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| The reason this was put on there is that our workshop, there seemed to be sentiment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| at Commissioner Norman's request that we have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| I believe it's been set for November the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| And so at that time our law director suggested that we extend the moratorium for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4728)|
| 1:18:53| And so that's why that's on here was at the request of the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| and Mr. Norman suggesting that we have a workshop, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| Yeah, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer it for 60 days simply to get it out of the holiday period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4743)|
| 1:19:11| People, this is something that's been going on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4751)|
| 1:19:14| It's very important to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| And with the holidays coming up, it's people's attentions being looking at the holidays and not at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4756)|
| 1:19:24| So I prefer that we put it off to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| There's been a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| First.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| I know there's a smell of dead horse in the room, but I'm going to continue to beat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4781)|
| 1:19:46| But how many more times are we going to put this thing off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| Last week, I know Dr. Briggs, you weren't here, but, you know, made what I thought was a pretty strong plea to get to the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4792)|
| 1:20:03| I still think parties up here know what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| Maybe this ordinance is a bit too strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4807)|
| 1:20:11| I think people know what they can live with at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| We've dialogued about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4814)|
| 1:20:15| We've read about it from the e-mails we've gotten, the conversations we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4815)|
| 1:20:22| I think we're really think we're ready to vote today if the wording is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4822)|
| 1:20:28| And I think Commissioner Hammond said, appropriately said, you know, there are some things that can happen with this to make him get behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4828)|
| 1:20:38| Some, you know, changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| I won't say tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| More than tweaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4840)|
| 1:20:41| Changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4841)|
| 1:20:42| But I think we all know what we want this thing to look like in order to get six votes or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4842)|
| 1:20:49| I'm just, it's not fair to both parties, you know, the opponents and the proponents of this ordinance for us to continually put this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4849)|
| 1:21:02| You know, January, who knows what will happen in January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4862)|
| 1:21:06| And we're starting to get nearly close to budget season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4866)|
| 1:21:10| So, you know, if it doesn't happen in January, then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| We're going to go 60 days and then we're in the budget cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| So I just, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4875)|
| 1:21:19| I'm not going to be too adversarial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4879)|
| 1:21:22| But can we put a hook in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4882)|
| 1:21:25| Can we say that it shall be decided in the month of January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4885)|
| 1:21:29| Is that, could we somehow get that as a friendly amendment, Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| And I know you want this over, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4900)|
| 1:21:41| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| May I comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4903)|
| 1:21:46| May I comment, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4908)|
| 1:21:49| Sam, I agree with 99 percent of what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| I'm tired of beating the dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| The problem is I don't know what horse I'm beating because if we start having a compromise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4914)|
| 1:21:59| which evidently the workshop is about, then it's a whole different horse than what we're talking about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| And the reason I want to put it off is I have a feeling that there's going to be something come out of this workshop that's different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4925)|
| 1:22:11| than what's there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| If what's there right now was going to be there, then I'd say, fine, let's vote on it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4933)|
| 1:22:17| because I think people have made up their minds about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| But if there's a compromise, if there are changes, this is very important to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4939)|
| 1:22:24| This is something that could affect us for the next 20 or 25 years, how we live, what our community looks like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4944)|
| 1:22:30| what the nature of the presentation is of our community to people that are passing through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4950)|
| 1:22:37| And happening right between Thanksgiving and Christmas over something that we don't even know what's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4957)|
| 1:22:44| then that's why I want to put it off to January because we're going to want to have citizens involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| People are distracted by all that's going on with the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| And so we're not talking about, you know, the same old dead horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4973)|
| 1:22:56| Like I said, I don't know what horse we're even going to be riding in on that's going to be coming in to be voted on in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| That's why I want to put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| If it wasn't for the workshop, I'd say, let's go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4983)|
| 1:23:06| That's been proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| And so we may have a whole different issue that we're voting on after November 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4987)|
| 1:23:14| And really, we can't really vote on anything on November 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4994)|
| 1:23:17| If any changes are made, those won't even occur until the December meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| And then we won't have any input from the citizens about the new changes because there won't be any more forums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5001)|
| 1:23:27| I don't want any more forums either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| But if we come up with something different, then we need to have forums over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5015)|
| 1:23:36| Commissioner Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| I just wanted to point out that according to the Mayan calendar, the world's going to end on December 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| And so it doesn't matter if we defer it until December or January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| End effect is going to be the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| No billboards anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5027)|
| 1:23:50| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5030)|
| 1:23:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| I must have missed a memo somewhere because according to my book, that means the 29th, not the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| That's what I had down, best I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| I haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| When is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5041)|

| 1:24:08| I remember the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| I didn't be sure I didn't sleep through anything there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5056)|
| 1:24:17| We have a substitute motion to defer for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5057)|
| 1:24:22| We'll vote on that starting in the first district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| If the first district is with us, we'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| I'll vote for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5069)|

| 1:25:26| The ayes have it, 7-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5126)|
| 1:25:31| So we'll suspend that for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5131)|
| 1:25:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5138)|
| 1:25:43| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5143)|
| 1:25:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5144)|
| 1:25:45| There was Julie pointed out to me that on the resolution it says it's really just for extending the billboard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5145)|
| 1:25:52| moratorium for an additional 30 days is that we're really extending the moratorium, okay, for 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5152)|
| 1:26:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5160)|
| 1:26:01| So we're going to have to vote again, you think, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| We're good to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Well, I think we're okay because we've got a moratorium now that takes us to the end of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| So this will give us time to act on this, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| The question presented was, was the substitute amendment for 60-day deferral including the moratorium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5173)|
| 1:26:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5185)|
| 1:26:26| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Does the second agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5189)|
| 1:26:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| A question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| Will 60 days get us to the commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| Because we're meeting early because of the holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| Will 60 days be enough to get us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| I don't think it will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5205)|
| 1:26:47| 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| The OMB is saying no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5208)|
| 1:26:49| I think he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5209)|
| 1:26:50| What day is the fourth Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5210)|
| 1:26:53| Yeah, no, it's the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| So I don't think 60 days will get us where we need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| End of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| Or January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5224)|
| 1:27:05| I just hate for the, you know, a good or bad lawyer to get a hold of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| Yeah, either one would do us damage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Commissioners, we'll need another motion then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5234)|
| 1:27:18| So I guess I will move that we defer this item until the January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5238)|
| 1:27:27| January 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5247)|

| 1:32:14| I have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| First and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Commissioner Wright, this is your order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I'll let you speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Everyone, with the exception of Commissioner Wunbe, is set on county commission at a larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5546)|
| 1:32:31| size than we currently are seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5551)|
| 1:32:34| Everyone knows my longstanding opinion, the fact that commission size was reduced, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5554)|
| 1:32:42| the amount of work, especially for county residential commissioners, did not get reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5562)|
| 1:32:49| I only say that because inside the city of Knoxville there is another part of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5569)|
| 1:33:00| which takes care of some of the concerns of the constituents of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| Whenever this charter amendment was offered, the people that were offering it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| wanted to go to nine commission members, one from each district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| And the understanding at that time is that that was pretty close to the minimum size of commissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| and compared to some adjoining counties was a considerable reduction in the citizen legislature makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5603)|
| 1:33:37| I think at that time people were primarily against the people that were sitting in the seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5617)|
| 1:33:48| not the seats themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| Now, fast forward to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| I still maintain that size of commission is too small to get the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| In fact, at one of the recent committee meetings the comment was made we have too many committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| and not enough commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| Having said that, I also realize we got ourselves into a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5653)|
| 1:34:19| Nothing can be changed for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| The at-large commissioners, which should have been staggered, probably,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5667)|
| 1:34:33| if we had a good feel for what was taking place, the number of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5673)|
| 1:34:40| in individual districts was staggered, but the two at-larges were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5680)|
| 1:34:47| I just think that there was a lot of knee-jerk and thought of the moment that changed the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5687)|
| 1:34:53| and I would venture that over the next couple of years we'll see some movement toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5693)|
| 1:35:01| there should be more commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| And with that, I move for the approval of this ordinance on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5703)|
| 1:35:11| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5713)|
| 1:35:15| You know, the bad thing about my opposition to this is I agree with every word that Commissioner Wright said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| This was a, you know, throw the bums out after Black Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5724)|
| 1:35:29| knee-jerk reaction to a body that was actually well thought out and well designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5729)|
| 1:35:39| but just didn't like the players or the previous players or the, you know, characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5739)|
| 1:35:44| So I just don't think this ordinance, quite frankly, goes far enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5744)|
| 1:35:55| And I think in the end, if we don't go far enough and really get buy-in from a wider audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5755)|
| 1:36:07| even if it's passed, it won't be beneficial to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5767)|
| 1:36:13| Commissioner Wright is correct in that, you know, the whole X number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5773)|
| 1:36:18| I don't remember the number of questions that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| They used best practices from Louisville and other places that had functional, you know, bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5781)|
| 1:36:28| And all that was good data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| But, you know, as we all know, Louisville is not Atlanta and it's definitely not Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5790)|
| 1:36:36| So we needed an internal process to get to what was best, if anything, in terms of a change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5796)|
| 1:36:43| what was best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| So, you know, and this was lunked in with, I don't know, three, four, five other, you know, pieces of legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5807)|
| 1:36:58| some that people could get behind because they jailed those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| I'm giving a history lesson here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| They jailed those 11 questions down to two and nine down to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| So, you know, again, I agree with what Commissioner Wright is trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5827)|
| 1:37:12| This is a difficult part-time job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| Commissioner, former Commissioner Pinkson put it quite nicely when he said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5835)|
| 1:37:20| if we're in this thing for the money, we go to work at McDonald's because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| per hour that we spend a month, we're way below minimum wage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5844)|
| 1:37:28| So this is a passion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| This is because we love our community and our districts and our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5850)|
| 1:37:35| I just don't think this particular ordinance cuts to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5855)|
| 1:37:39| I think we have two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5859)|
| 1:37:42| I think we need to start in earnest with a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| And I'd be glad to get engaged with you, Commissioner Wright, and whomever else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| and whatever players that, you know, need to be at the table and come up with something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| I think, gets at what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| Then my last statement, and this is to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5879)|
| 1:38:05| I guess I'm trying to understand the wording of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5885)|
| 1:38:11| Are these two charter dates in 88 and 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5891)|
| 1:38:16| I know 8-2-12 was when this was voted in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5896)|
| 1:38:21| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5901)|
| 1:38:22| That was the election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| The 88 charter change or whatever, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5903)|
| 1:38:30| That was the original 19 date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5913)|
| 1:38:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5914)|
| 1:38:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5916)|
| 1:38:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5917)|
| 1:38:38| It was the original charter in 88, and then the next date is when it was amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| So, again, you know, I agree wholeheartedly with Commissioner Wright's sentiment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| I just, you know, there are several challenging questions with going with this 15 that I can't get behind right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5936)|
| 1:38:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Next on the list, Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5941)|
| 1:39:02| Let me begin my remarks by saying this will not affect me at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| because I'm going to be here for a few more months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| and then I will move away into the sunset and wish you all well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5948)|
| 1:39:12| and having appreciated my term on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| You know, it's a wonderful term, being a night large commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5955)|
| 1:39:17| This will not affect me personally at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| I do have some questions about this and two or three things that I'll bring up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5960)|
| 1:39:24| First of all, over the last few weeks since this has come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5964)|
| 1:39:28| I have had an opportunity to meet with a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| I'm out in the community a lot, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| and I asked the question, how many of you are concerned about the 11 member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| Do you think that we should increase to whatever number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| I have had no one, no one say anything to me about the fact that they think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5979)|
| 1:39:44| they think that we need to increase or what that number should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| The only people I have heard anything from have been members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| And so, if there was an overriding concern out in the community that we're not doing our jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5992)|
| 1:39:57| or not doing them properly, I think we would be hearing about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| and I think that people would be very vocal about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| Maybe other people are hearing it and they're hearing a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| I'm just not hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6005)|
| 1:40:07| But having said that, regardless of whether I'm hearing it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6007)|
| 1:40:11| I guess the question that I would have is if we're going to present to the community a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| then let's look at a well-thought-out and developed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6018)|
| 1:40:23| So the first question I would have, why 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Why not 13?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| Why not 11?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| 17?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Let's go back to 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| What is the number of 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| Also, if we say, let's do 15, what will that look like in the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6035)|
| 1:40:41| Maybe MPC can draw us up a plan of what a 15-member body would look like and how that would look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| I think we owe it to our citizens to let them know what that would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| Where would these seats come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6052)|
| 1:40:54| What geographical area would they represent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6054)|
| 1:40:59| But maybe we give them options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Maybe we go to MPC and say, let's look at a 13-member body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| Let's look at an 11-member body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6065)|
| 1:41:06| In other words, let's look at all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| Because we've got two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| It's not like we have to do anything today, right now, because the vote is going to be in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6070)|
| 1:41:16| So it gives us time to really think about it, to really delve into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6076)|
| 1:41:21| And if we're concerned that when the citizens voted on it, they really didn't vote for the seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6081)|
| 1:41:26| They voted because they were mad or upset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Let's don't get them mad or upset again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6088)|
| 1:41:30| Let's let them have a well-thought-out plan that they can look at that we have vetted and gone into the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| and presented and said, here are the options, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| If you don't like the 11 and you don't like the at-large, here's what the 11 would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| Here's what 9 would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Here's what 15 would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6103)|
| 1:41:44| Here's what 17 would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| But let, to me, if we're going to go this direction, and I'm not totally against going to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6106)|
| 1:41:52| and asking them what they think, then let's have a good plan for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6112)|
| 1:41:57| To me, just passing this today and saying, okay, let's do a 15-member body without doing that due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| I know we've got to do another second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| But to me, that's the direction I would like for us to go in, is let's really define if this is not working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| and if the community really feels like we need to have another plan, what is that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6132)|
| 1:42:17| And who came up with the 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6137)|
| 1:42:19| I mean, why was the 15 done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6139)|
| 1:42:21| And I'm not saying there's anything nefarious going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6141)|
| 1:42:23| I'm just saying I think the community needs to know why the number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| The other last point I would make is we spent a lot of time trying to bring the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| and the commission together, and we have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| And we spent a lot of time and effort doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| And now we're coming back and saying, okay, let's not have the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6158)|
| 1:42:42| and the commission together, but let's go outside those boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| Again, what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| What schools and how would that interact with the school districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| And how would 15 or 13 or 17 commission districts interact with the school board districts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| So those are just some questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| Again, I'm not against looking at anything or talking about anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| I just think that we need to present our folks, this is their government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6184)|
| 1:43:08| let's present them with a well-thought-out plan and maybe some options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| and go in and do public hearings and let them tell us what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6196)|
| 1:43:18| Good thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6198)|
| 1:43:19| Commissioner Schatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6199)|
| 1:43:20| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6200)|
| 1:43:21| I'll try not to be repetitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| I've spoken to this a couple times before when it's been on discussion item, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| I agree with a lot that Commissioner Wright has said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6210)|
| 1:43:34| It wasn't necessarily at the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| It was at possibly some individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| And I believe if it had been on the ballot to reduce it to three, it may have passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| It was just, you know, those guys are bad and they're lousy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| Let's get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6227)|
| 1:43:49| And the voters seem to take their vengeance on the size, so it was reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| I didn't stay out of the campaign, of course, but I was not for the reduction, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| But it's with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| We've been into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| We're into it for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| I mean, it's in a political time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6244)|
| 1:44:07| It's a very short time period that we've been in this, two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| I look at all the fruit basket turnover that's been going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6253)|
| 1:44:18| Commissioner Hammond mentioned aligning with the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| I was in the legislative 17th and gone to the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Bonnie Kate, Mount Olive, 24 Hughes, Sequoia, they were in the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| They've gone to the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6268)|
| 1:44:30| The new 89th district in northwest Knotts County, I speculate 40 percent of the county was shifted from 130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6270)|
| 1:44:38| I didn't do a study on it, but a large portion, a portion of our county was shifted legislatively from district to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6278)|
| 1:44:44| from old district to a new district because of the census.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| Of course, you know, the new party, the Republicans in charge in Nashville, so it was things were juggled around somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6289)|
| 1:44:57| But I think that would be a knee-jerk reaction two years into this to suddenly change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6297)|
| 1:45:05| The money saved is I'll have to agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| When I look at the money saved, it's 55 or 60 cents per Knotts County citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| So the money saved from going to 19 to 11 is less than the price of a newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6315)|
| 1:45:21| But having said that, I can't support this at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| And I would also ask, looking at the time frame, now let me mention this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6326)|
| 1:45:32| By what the charter review came up with and put on the ballot and passed, it appears I would be able to run for one more term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6332)|
| 1:45:41| having served a partial term and hopefully a complete full term here, a four-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| And so it would affect me personally in my political career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| And I will deal with whatever hand I'm dealt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| I would much rather run in 10 or 12 precincts than 93, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| But nevertheless, being that as it may, the time frame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6365)|
| 1:46:09| wouldn't this have to be on changes to our charter, have to be on the August or the November ballot in 2014?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6369)|
| 1:46:23| Either one in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6383)|
| 1:46:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6385)|
| 1:46:26| Well, we have a May primary and an August general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| So what do I do, file two petitions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6391)|
| 1:46:33| I mean, it's illogical to me how we could we're changing something three months after an election is decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6393)|
| 1:46:43| I may be missing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6403)|
| 1:46:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| But just that would be this couldn't be on to August when it's the general election for county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6405)|
| 1:46:50| So I don't think it would mechanically work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6410)|
| 1:46:54| But nevertheless, I'm a no vote and I'll certainly abide by majority wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| Thank you, Commissioner Schaus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6419)|
| 1:47:00| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6420)|
| 1:47:02| And I think the answer to that is that there's a law that you can't shorten anyone's term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6422)|
| 1:47:08| So if you were elected in 2014, the changes, and we voted on this in 2014,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6428)|
| 1:47:13| the changes would not go into effect until 2018 at the earliest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| So 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| We would vote on it in 2014, but the changes, the earliest the changes could take place would be 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6439)|
| 1:47:24| because we could not legally shorten your four-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6444)|
| 1:47:27| If you were reelected in 2014, we could not legally shorten your term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| So that would be the soonest it could be implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6452)|
| 1:47:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6455)|
| 1:47:36| I was thinking it was shooting at 14, the year 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6456)|
| 1:47:41| That would be the earliest we could vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6461)|
| 1:47:43| But it wouldn't go into effect until later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6463)|
| 1:47:45| And that's one of the comments that I wanted to make was that, you know, all these concerns about all this redistricting going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6465)|
| 1:47:50| you know, regardless of whether we do this or not, the date that it would happen is so far out in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| Because of that law, that I don't think that's really consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6477)|
| 1:48:00| You know, I was never really hot about lining up school districts and commission districts anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6480)|
| 1:48:05| I don't see that that's a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6485)|
| 1:48:07| I am concerned about if we go to more districts, what that's going to look like in terms of minority representation on the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| I would have to look at any proposed plans very, very carefully to see what that looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| I do think that, and I'm going to actually vote yes for this because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6500)|
| 1:48:27| although I agree, I support it and I support Commissioner Wright in stepping out on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6507)|
| 1:48:32| because it could be a very unpopular place to put your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| So I'm going to support him in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6518)|
| 1:48:40| But I do think that it would be better to have a task force or study committee come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6520)|
| 1:48:45| and do exactly what Commissioner Hammond said, that we need to do much more study on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6525)|
| 1:48:50| before we come forward with anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6530)|
| 1:48:53| I also want to point out that the data that was used to give the justification for a smaller commission rather than a larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6533)|
| 1:49:01| I've gone back and looked at that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| I did this during the Charter Review Committee process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| I went back and looked at that data and dug further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| I actually called the counties that were listed as our cohort counties to compare to about why we needed, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| these had smaller commissions and they worked just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| And I actually called the commissioners in those counties and talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| You know, they make maybe $68,000 a year and they have a staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6562)|
| 1:49:27| Each commissioner has their own personal assistant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6567)|
| 1:49:30| So, you know, the data was given to show, yes, a smaller commission can work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6570)|
| 1:49:38| but the complete data was not given, that it actually did not save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| It actually ended up costing more because those commissioners, those were full-time jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| and they were paid accordingly, and each commissioner also had their own staff person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| So I think that those, and that's just one example from one county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6592)|
| 1:49:58| but I did talk with almost all of our cohort counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6598)|
| 1:50:01| In fact, one of the women commissioners from one of our cohort counties actually serve on a national committee with her now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6601)|
| 1:50:08| So I've had a great time learning from her how things go in North Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6608)|
| 1:50:14| But so I think that definitely this needs to be looked at again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6614)|
| 1:50:20| And I don't see this passing today, but I'm going to vote with you on this, Dave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| because I appreciate you putting your name out on this because I know that when you talk to people out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6627)|
| 1:50:32| it's probably not a very popular proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| But I think it's something that we're the ones that do the work and we know what work is involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| And I think that we need to take a good look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6640)|
| 1:50:45| Let me just interject with what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| You know, you talk about people out in the community, and then, Dr. Briggs, I'll get to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| I think it's a compliment to all of us as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6650)|
| 1:50:54| People are calling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6654)|
| 1:50:55| They're wanting to have complaints and we're taking care of those complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| So if they weren't having success with that, then we'd have a lot of complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| So that's a two-dose for commissioners here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| We're doing our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6665)|
| 1:51:06| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| I just agree with what Commissioner Hammond said a little bit earlier that we need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| Just while we've been discussing it, 15 may be half the number that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| Nashville has 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| Louisville has 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| You know, maybe we need 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| You know, we look at growing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| Maybe we do need 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Maybe we need a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| Maybe we need 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6690)|
| 1:51:32| 42 is, you know, 42 is what Nashville feels they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| You know, if we're talking about giving good service to our constituents, if we had 42,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| that sure would give us a lot of time to take care of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6702)|
| 1:51:45| But that just to throw it out there, Nashville has 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| Louisville, Kentucky has 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6712)|
| 1:51:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| Just a couple of quick comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| If they start paying these positions $68,000 a year in the staff, you will not have a lack of candidates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6717)|
| 1:52:03| They'll be lining up to run for these seats, I can assure you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| Secondly, I'll make a substitute motion that we form a task force and that we look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6726)|
| 1:52:13| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| That was my question to the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| When you have an ordinance, and I'm sorry, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6740)|
| 1:52:21| Can you do a substitute motion on an ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| Or you just need to vote it down and stop doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6744)|
| 1:52:30| You can amend an ordinance, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| And I don't know what we're fixing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| You're talking about changing this substantially, which sends it back to the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6756)|
| 1:52:40| It would send it back to the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6760)|
| 1:52:41| Or on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6761)|
| 1:52:42| But I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6762)|
| 1:52:45| Let me check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| You can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6767)|
| 1:52:48| Do you know on that, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6768)|
| 1:52:49| I'm sorry, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6769)|
| 1:52:50| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| No, I want to make sure we're doing the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| You can amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| You've got one here looking at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| And like anything else, you can move to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| I think the better practice is what Mr. Armstrong said, voted on first reading and one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6781)|
| 1:53:11| And in this case, if everybody wants to talk about it, vote it and amend it by saying that you approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6791)|
| 1:53:18| but you do want a task force before the second reading in which there will be a public hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| or however you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| But the thing of it is, we would not be able to have our second reading in 30 days on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6804)|
| 1:53:30| Tony, you're looking way down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6810)|
| 1:53:33| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6813)|
| 1:53:34| You can put off a second reading indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| You don't have to have it within 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6817)|
| 1:53:39| That's been a normal practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6819)|
| 1:53:41| Well, it's been your practice, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6821)|
| 1:53:42| But sometimes these motions, well, my experience is sometimes a second reading doesn't come up for a year down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6822)|
| 1:53:49| It happened in annexation ordinances with the city all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| But you can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| Let me put it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6836)|
| 1:53:57| You can amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| You can defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6838)|
| 1:53:59| You can table it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6839)|
| 1:54:01| You can come up with a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| This body can do whatever it wants under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| I'll defer to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6848)|
| 1:54:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6849)|
| 1:54:10| Then if we can do a substitute motion, I'd like to do a substitute motion that we form a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6850)|
| 1:54:14| And I have no problem with Commissioner Wright chairing that task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| and having others involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| And let's really sit down and roll up our sleeves and see what we can do to come up with some plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| So that will be my substitute motion is that we form a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6865)|
| 1:54:28| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| Second from Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6872)|
| 1:54:33| I thought you said we couldn't do a substitute motion on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6873)|
| 1:54:36| It has to be an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| Well, you're amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| You're replacing this one with you're making a motion to basically defer this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| You're not voting on the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6886)|
| 1:54:47| You're voting on a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6887)|
| 1:54:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6888)|
| 1:54:49| You're voting on a task force in place of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6889)|
| 1:54:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| So this would be a resolution rather than an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6895)|
| 1:54:56| Commissioner Schatz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6896)|
| 1:54:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6897)|
| 1:54:58| So this would be to not move it to the ballot, but to study it and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6898)|
| 1:55:03| Study it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6903)|
| 1:55:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6904)|
| 1:55:05| And I would add to just not for to dispute Dr. Briggs at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| but for clarification, those two examples he mentioned are metropolitan governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6911)|
| 1:55:15| Of course, Nashville-Davidson and Jefferson-Louisville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6915)|
| 1:55:19| So that wouldn't be if you add up metropolitan Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| you would have the nine council that would make 20 here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| And then, what's fair, you'd have five aldermen, so 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| Anyway, 40 might be the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| But I just want to throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6930)|
| 1:55:31| Those are both metros.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6931)|
| 1:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6933)|
| 1:55:34| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6934)|
| 1:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| This is just in comment to Commissioner Schatz, and that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6936)|
| 1:55:40| I agree those are metropolitan counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| But let's go back to Commissioner Boyle's comments about the cities that were named our sister cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6942)|
| 1:55:49| like Baltimore County doesn't even have the city of Baltimore in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| Or the county that was named in Alabama, they have not near the responsibility at the local county level in Alabama| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6955)|
| 1:56:03| as we have in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| Alabama runs everything at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| We could have been here for 15 or 20 minutes today and done the business that is done by counties in Alabama,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6968)|
| 1:56:16| the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| And as Commissioner Boyle has stated, I've talked to some of those counties, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6977)|
| 1:56:24| The one in Florida is they're really saying they're overworked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| I mean, they're really hammered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6989)|
| 1:56:31| And we're looking here in Knox County whenever we do meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| And I was at the committee meeting where we say we've got to sit down and rewrite our rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=6995)|
| 1:56:44| because we don't have enough commissioners to abide by the rules that we have now as standing rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| We have more work than we have commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7009)|
| 1:56:52| So I'm absolutely pleased at the fact that people would offer suggestions that we need to sit down now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7012)|
| 1:56:59| and look at it because, again, as Commissioner Boyle has so well pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7019)|
| 1:57:05| this does not affect the election upcoming for Commissioner Shoust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| This would only be wording on the ballot at that time talking about future dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| We're not thinking that we're going to do something that would affect the elections in 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| We're thinking about things that would affect the elections at dates after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| Or 2016, right, would not affect that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7048)|
| 1:57:31| If you're elected for four years, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7051)|
| 1:57:34| It does not short-term anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| It only talks about what would happen in the future from that point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| We can all pass any legislation here that would affect a sitting commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7062)|
| 1:57:50| All right, commissioners, we have a substitute motion to form a task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7070)|
| 1:57:54| and Commissioner Wright would chair that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7074)|
| 1:57:57| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7077)|
| 1:57:59| All in favor of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7079)|
| 1:58:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| Like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7093)|
| 1:58:14| These are ordinances on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7094)|
| 1:58:24| Consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee to amend the Knox County Code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7104)|
| 1:58:29| Chapter 12, Article 2, entitled Peddlers and Solicitors to Further Regulate Transient Vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| Enable the Knox County Department of Codes Administration and Inspections to enforce said regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| This is Ordinance O-97-5-101 adopted July 28, 1997,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7121)|
| 1:58:47| and Ordinance O-10-6-101 adopted July 26, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7127)|
| 1:58:53| This is on second reading, Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7133)|
| 1:58:57| I hear a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7139)|
| 1:59:00| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Properly second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| We share a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Oh, that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| You turned me off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| Commissioner Brown, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| You know, my concern is I mentioned last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| I think this is really too restrictive on moms and pops that want to sell a little bit of leftover produce to try to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7162)|
| 1:59:30| Produce is not in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7170)|
| 1:59:32| I suppose I want to build birdhouses, not go up here and sit on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7172)|
| 1:59:38| I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7178)|
| 1:59:40| I'm going to call them beanbag tosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7180)|
| 1:59:42| I don't want to use the other word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| I suppose I want to make the beanbag games and sit up here on the side of the road at a out-of-the-way place where I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7186)|
| 1:59:55| blocking traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| I'm in the parking lot of a convenience store, whatever, off the highway totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7196)|
| 2:00:06| This won't let me do it the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7206)|
| 2:00:11| Am I correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7211)|
| 2:00:16| If you get permission from the property owner, you might be able to do it without a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| But otherwise, you'd have to get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7221)|
| 2:00:23| That's not what Roy Braden said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7223)|
| 2:00:23| But, I mean, I know that Roy is the most compassionate man probably we have in county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7223)|
| 2:00:31| Bill back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| Oh, he's sitting back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7233)|
| 2:00:34| No, that's Jack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| But they take those on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7236)|
| 2:00:40| Unless somebody is flagrantly violating the law or somebody complains, they let them do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7240)|
| 2:00:46| But still, I could be making those beanbag tosses, but I'm operating illegally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7246)|
| 2:00:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7254)|
| 2:00:55| Bill, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| The way I understand it, that it's written to just require that they get the proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| Bill, state your name and department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| Bill Pierce, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7263)|
| 2:01:07| It was written with the intent that those people would get the proper license from the county clerk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| and the permit from the codes administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| Yeah, I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| But they do that two days a year or maybe three days at Christmas time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7277)|
| 2:01:21| It just seems superfluous to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7281)|
| 2:01:24| I know the county needs money on license and all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| but for Mr. and Mrs. John Doe to go out here and get a license just to sell up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| but to buy low market off the highway for three days out of the year, I just think it's kind of restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7291)|
| 2:01:39| But, again, as I said, you know, unless they are complained about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7299)|
| 2:01:47| or in some kind of flagrant violation, they're not going to be prosecuted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| But it just doesn't seem like it's the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7314)|
| 2:02:03| Commissioner Ratton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7323)|
| 2:02:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7325)|
| 2:02:07| The permit that we're talking about, what's the dollar value of this permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7327)|
| 2:02:14| I believe that would be a $50 permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| So we're talking about mom and pop here has to get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| And we need to talk about four days out of the year, not three or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| So let's talk about four days out of the year they want to sell beanbag tosses and try to make 50 bucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7345)|
| 2:02:32| but the permit costs $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| And the permit's just good for the one week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| No, it's longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| It's longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| Okay, 15 days it's good for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7365)|
| 2:02:47| So then you have the other permit and it's six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| There's two permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| And then backing up on the produce, if it's in an ag zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7371)|
| 2:02:57| the produce has to be grown on the real estate, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7377)|
| 2:03:00| That's for a roadside stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| The transit vendor actually has an exception that says if you, in fact, produce agricultural products,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| you're exempt from this regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7387)|
| 2:03:11| So then that really turns them into a vendor needing the permit and sales tax license and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7391)|
| 2:03:20| No, for agricultural products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| Okay, yeah, reduce the sales tax there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7402)|
| 2:03:26| But the person still has to have the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| They have to have the leeway from the property owner to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7409)|
| 2:03:42| The thing that we're looking at, though, as Commissioner Brown has brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7422)|
| 2:03:46| I believe is the not the transit vendor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7426)|
| 2:03:50| but the local resident wanting to do it more than three times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7430)|
| 2:03:54| And we're going to prohibit that unless they have a rather expensive permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7434)|
| 2:04:03| I think I've said it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7443)|
| 2:04:06| There's a lot of ins and outs to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7446)|
| 2:04:09| What we were trying to get away from in Commissioner Smith's district was people that were sitting up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7449)|
| 2:04:16| at the out-of-business by-law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7456)|
| 2:04:21| When this was brought to light, I believe those people disappeared from that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| Did they go somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| They're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7467)|
| 2:04:28| Yeah, they're back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7468)|
| 2:04:29| Back at the by-law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7469)|
| 2:04:30| They're waiting to see if this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| And they know that they're sort of limited on their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7472)|
| 2:04:36| But there are things that are going to come and get them now that they may not have known about in the past, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7476)|
| 2:04:41| They've got to have permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| They've got to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7484)|
| 2:04:45| And that will be discussed to them and then give them some time to react to that and, you know, if it's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| I'm still a little uncomfortable with it, so I'm going to vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7492)|
| 2:04:56| But you're talking about, in the case out there, that these are semi-permanent folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7496)|
| 2:05:04| No, they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7504)|
| 2:05:05| Some out there, there's people that are randomly setting up flea markets on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| and also on enclosed business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| But it's the same people over and over and over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| No, it's not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7515)|
| 2:05:16| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| People set up bread spread out and just say, here, we'll sell this or that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7519)|
| 2:05:20| They could be doing it in their subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7520)|
| 2:05:22| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| We've got a conversation going on over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| I've got my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| I know you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7526)|
| 2:05:27| And you're up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| I know the rest of you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7528)|
| 2:05:32| Here's the problem that this is why I don't have a problem with this, and I want to be clear on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7532)|
| 2:05:37| because I've, like the rest of you, gotten a lot of e-mails from people who say, oh, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7537)|
| 2:05:42| this couple just wants to go out and make a little money on the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7542)|
| 2:05:46| You know, they just want to set up their little stand and sell their bean bag games on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7546)|
| 2:05:50| and make a little money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| What about the legitimate business owner who does do their sales tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7552)|
| 2:05:58| and who does run and operate a legitimate business year-round, who needs to do everything that they're supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7558)|
| 2:06:07| He may be selling the same game that they buy at cost and then sell for a reasonable profit to cover their overhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7567)|
| 2:06:14| and to cover and they pay sales tax on it, which we all need and which the state needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7574)|
| 2:06:19| And then at Christmas time, somebody goes and sets up on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| and undersells them for $5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7584)|
| 2:06:26| You know, I'm sorry, but I'm more concerned about people who are running legitimate businesses in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7586)|
| 2:06:33| and how they're getting by than I am about the people who are trying to make money under the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7593)|
| 2:06:39| So I understand that economic times are hard and that everybody's trying to do all they can to keep their income stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7599)|
| 2:06:49| But my primary concern is with our small business owners who are doing everything that they're supposed to be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7609)|
| 2:06:56| to do business legally in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| That's my number one concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| And, Commissioner, is this they're supposed to have this permit already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7623)|
| 2:07:07| If you're out here selling these bean bag things, you're supposed to already have your permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| All that we're adding to this, this ordinance does, is require that you show that you've got adequate parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7632)|
| 2:07:17| and to get a permit, and that permit's for six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7637)|
| 2:07:21| So, you know, discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| Roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7644)|

| 2:08:05| Nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| Nine to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7688)|
| 2:08:09| And the constituents of the seventh and sixth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7693)|
| 2:08:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| Public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| Clerk, is that where we're at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| We have anybody else speak on public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7702)|
| 2:08:24| We had some other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7704)|
| 2:08:25| Are the Ammons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7705)|
| 2:08:26| I think they wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| I don't see them in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7710)|
| 2:08:31| They might be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| And Gail was coming at five o'clock, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7715)|
| 2:08:36| Or is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7718)|
| 2:08:39| Yeah, Gail would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7719)|
| 2:08:40| And George Hamilton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7720)|
| 2:08:41| Is George Hamilton here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7723)|
| 2:08:44| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7724)|
| 2:08:47| Let's go back to something I referred to at the beginning of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7727)|
| 2:08:51| the meeting as far as adding a discussion on them on the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7736)|
| 2:09:00| I think that since we have state people ready to put some money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7740)|
| 2:09:06| in, city people interested in helping out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| we need to strike while the iron is hot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7750)|
| 2:09:12| We can't wait on this, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| We need to get a workshop set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7754)|
| 2:09:19| possibly commission and council together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| whatever it takes, get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| I'm suggesting as soon as the first year as we can and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7764)|
| 2:09:28| something moving on it because if you look at those figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7768)|
| 2:09:33| how much they've increased the inmates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7773)|
| 2:09:35| You all get that every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| How much they've increased in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7777)|
| 2:09:41| And believe me, if you talk to J.J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7781)|
| 2:09:44| and Randy Nichols, they can tell you that right now today there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| folks going back out on the street that don't need back out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| on the street, but they've got to have the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| And that's bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| That's bad for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7796)|
| 2:09:57| It's not safe for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| So we need to get started on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| And while these folks are ready and willing, let's get some talking done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| It is a very positive discussion at the luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7807)|
| 2:10:09| So we're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7809)|
| 2:10:10| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7810)|
| 2:10:11| Yeah, I'm sorry I missed the luncheon today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7811)|
| 2:10:13| Aiden is home sick from school today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7813)|
| 2:10:15| and I'm probably going to slip out here and not stay for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| I know you're all going to miss me terribly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7819)|
| 2:10:21| but I want to get home and check on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7821)|
| 2:10:24| And so I missed the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| but we have a jail overcrowding task force that was meeting regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| until the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| And I've asked a couple of times, why are we not meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7834)|
| 2:10:37| Because we have been seeing those numbers inching up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7837)|
| 2:10:39| So I don't know why this task force has not been meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| but we need to be doing that again, I think, meeting on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7843)|
| 2:10:48| Brad, do you know why we've not been meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7848)|
| 2:10:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7851)|
| 2:10:53| The court, the federal court has, the compliance has been accommodating on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| The reason the Justice Committee came together is because of the overcrowding downstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| And so the federal court has been happy with the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| And so there's really been the overcrowding issues at the detention facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| which is not under federal mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7868)|
| 2:11:10| No, but when the committee was meeting, we were talking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7870)|
| 2:11:12| We weren't talking about downstairs anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| We were working on the issues at the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| So I don't understand why that stopped with the change of administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7876)|
| 2:11:20| But I hope that we'll get back to meeting with, you know, that group meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| and dealing with this as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| Because one of the things that this group was working on that would make a tremendous difference on this is the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7888)|
| 2:11:34| of the mentally ill in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| So I hope that people will take note and set a meeting for that group soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7897)|
| 2:11:45| Well, that's another thing I didn't mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7905)|
| 2:11:47| Dr. Black is ready, willing, and able to assist us in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7907)|
| 2:11:51| So I think that's our first step is that safety center, justice center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7911)|
| 2:11:59| Anything else come before the commission at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| We'll adjourn and be back for zonings at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| We'll go ahead and call the zoning to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7928)|
| 2:12:13| And, clerk, if you'll call the roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| Commissioner Burroughs is out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7940)|

| 2:12:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7947)|
| 2:12:28| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7959)|
| 2:12:42| All members present, first order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7962)|
| 2:12:51| Request of Hunter Valley Farm for rezoning from agricultural to T-transition property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7971)|
| 2:12:56| located northwest side of Hunter Valley Lane northeast of Tedford Lane in the 4th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7976)|
| 2:13:04| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7984)|
| 2:13:06| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, Arthur Seymour, Jr.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7986)|
| 2:13:09| I'm here on behalf of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7989)|
| 2:13:13| We would ask approval pursuant to MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7993)|
| 2:13:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7997)|
| 2:13:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=7998)|
| 2:13:21| MPC, any remarks for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8003)|
| 2:13:24| That microphone doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8004)|
| 2:13:25| That one doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8009)|
| 2:13:30| When it came for MPC, we had that on our consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8010)|
| 2:13:33| And it was adopted without any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8013)|
| 2:13:36| So we didn't have any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8016)|
| 2:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| The 4th District is not here represented today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| Are you the 4th District?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8023)|
| 2:13:44| I thought that was Tony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8024)|
| 2:13:45| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8025)|
| 2:13:46| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8029)|
| 2:13:50| 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8030)|
| 2:13:51| I ask for approval per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8031)|
| 2:13:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8035)|
| 2:13:56| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8039)|
| 2:14:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8041)|
| 2:14:02| Opposed, like sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8042)|
| 2:14:04| Request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to adopt the 2012 South County Sector Plan update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8044)|
| 2:14:10| Commission District 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8050)|
| 2:14:13| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8055)|
| 2:14:16| Then property 1st and 2nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8056)|
| 2:14:19| Any discussion from Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8059)|
| 2:14:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8061)|
| 2:14:22| Commissioner Brown, it's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8062)|
| 2:14:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| In your sheet there, it shows District 8 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| And Buzz is checking on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| I guess it's just a matter of putting the word in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8070)|
| 2:14:34| But Gap Creek was in the 8th for a while until the last redistricting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8074)|
| 2:14:42| But now it's back in the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8082)|
| 2:14:44| So he is double checking that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8084)|
| 2:14:48| But it basically will revolve around the 9th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8088)|
| 2:14:52| In addition to that, MPC may want to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8092)|
| 2:14:58| More flowery definitions than maybe I could give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| But in this South County Sector Plan, there is a scenic highway overlook put on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8102)|
| 2:15:11| I mean, Johnsonville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| So, Mike Carberry or Buzz, you may want to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8113)|
| 2:15:23| We're on Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| I'm up to the big boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8126)|
| 2:15:32| Mike Carberry, MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8132)|
| 2:15:34| The state has designated Johnsonville Highway as a scenic highway, which protects it from certain sign regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8134)|
| 2:15:47| like billboards and those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8147)|
| 2:15:51| To go beyond that, local government, the county or the city, depending on who has jurisdiction over what portion of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8151)|
| 2:15:59| would have to use their own zoning powers if they were going to go beyond the billboard control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8159)|
| 2:16:08| and the junkyards and that kind of thing if they wanted to have more stringent design guidelines for the highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| We do call for that in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| This plan does not put that into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| We would have to do a secondary step to meet with the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| and eventually come back to you folks to enact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8185)|
| 2:16:33| With the MPC, it's just like with anything else in the legislative body here that the state law still prevails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8193)|
| 2:16:40| So anything that would be done would have to be in conjunction and aligned with the state laws on scenic highways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8200)|
| 2:16:49| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8209)|
| 2:16:51| The second thing was there was a question come up about the new, well, it's not new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8211)|
| 2:16:59| It's been around since 1977, the proposed James White Parkway extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| I know that it's mentioned in there, but only the fact that, how did you tell me a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| the fact that if it does come to fruition that there would have to be another study done as far as land usages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8229)|
| 2:17:17| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| We recognize in this plan that there was an environmental impact statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| or analysis underway that has just recently come out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8243)|
| 2:17:30| but there hasn't been any build or no build decision made on that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8250)|
| 2:17:37| So we said essentially until a decision is made, we don't need to change the land use that's in this plan relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8257)|
| 2:17:46| If it was decided to go ahead and build it, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8266)|
| 2:17:50| then it would have implications for some land use change along that corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8270)|
| 2:17:55| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8275)|
| 2:17:56| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8277)|
| 2:17:59| Were you through, Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| Commissioner, were you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8281)|
| 2:18:02| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8282)|
| 2:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8283)|
| 2:18:04| The rest of the public here wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8284)|
| 2:18:19| Ma'am, we'll need your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8299)|
| 2:18:22| My name is Gail Wood, and I live at 3233 Topside Road in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8302)|
| 2:18:31| I'm here to recommend approval of the South Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8311)|
| 2:18:39| I have a great interest with my family in a specific property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8319)|
| 2:18:49| It is the Adams property at 3210 John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8329)|
| 2:18:56| The property is now zoned agricultural, and they are seeking to have it zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8336)|
| 2:19:02| And the lay of the land just so happens that my property line adjoins the Adams property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8342)|
| 2:19:12| And about two-and-a-half years ago, they came in and went to the back of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8352)|
| 2:19:19| and removed all of the old growth woods that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8359)|
| 2:19:24| And everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8364)|
| 2:19:26| It was basically left as clay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8366)|
| 2:19:29| They recontoured it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8369)|
| 2:19:30| It's a hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8370)|
| 2:19:31| It goes up like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| It's terraced for a detention pond, and then it goes up and it's terraced again as a parking pad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8373)|
| 2:19:42| But unfortunately, I have a creek and an acre-and-a-half pond at the bottom of this hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8382)|
| 2:19:47| It's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8387)|
| 2:19:49| The land goes up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| There was one silt fence put at the bottom about two-and-a-half years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8390)|
| 2:19:55| Mr. Adams did come on the property without a permit, without drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8395)|
| 2:20:02| As I said, he did the excavation in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| So the only people, I guess, that knew about it was us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8405)|
| 2:20:10| There has been runoff in my pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| This creek fills the pond, and then the creek runs off into the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8413)|
| 2:20:22| When you come up to the next level where my house is, and my house is on the same level as Topside Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8422)|
| 2:20:31| when you come into my driveway at Topside and pull up to my house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8431)|
| 2:20:38| the Adams property is sort of a panorama like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| And that's what you see when you drive up to my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8443)|
| 2:20:47| And the leaves are still on the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8447)|
| 2:20:49| Some of the leaves are still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8449)|
| 2:20:51| You see all that clay, that steep hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8451)|
| 2:20:54| You see silt fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8454)|
| 2:20:57| I actually went to the expense of planting some 12-foot evergreens there just at the corner of my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8457)|
| 2:21:05| to try to divert a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8465)|
| 2:21:08| But, you know, the scale is too large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8468)|
| 2:21:13| There's just no way that I could give myself back the protection that I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8473)|
| 2:21:20| You can see the traffic on John Sevier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| I can see it from my kitchen window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| I have a cookout out in my back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8487)|
| 2:21:29| This is where the family gathers and plays in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8489)|
| 2:21:34| And you can see all this clay graded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| You can see the silt fence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| You can see the equipment when it's back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8500)|
| 2:21:45| You can hear the traffic, especially those big diesel trucks, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8505)|
| 2:21:50| as they gear down to try to strain and get up the grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| You know, my property value definitely has been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8515)|
| 2:22:02| But I think the worst thing is my personal sense of protection and privacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8522)|
| 2:22:13| I think I feel like I've personally been attacked a little bit, but it's my quality of life has been robbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8533)|
| 2:22:22| And I, you know, I don't know if I have any way of reestablishing any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8542)|
| 2:22:29| I think if the property were made commercial, then there would be the equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8549)|
| 2:22:34| I'm talking about large, earth-moving equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8554)|
| 2:22:40| And, you know, just to add one more thing, I am very grateful to have these avenues to tell people about my problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8560)|
| 2:22:54| I was able to send packets to all of the commissioners last week, and I've talked to some of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8574)|
| 2:23:02| Mr. Shouse and Mr. Brown both attended a community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8582)|
| 2:23:06| Mr. Brown has been supportive and actually has had conversations with Roy Braden, which he might wish to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8586)|
| 2:23:17| I will tell you this, that as of Friday, Mr. Braden emailed me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8597)|
| 2:23:22| and the items were served with a notice of violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8602)|
| 2:23:28| So, again, thank you very much for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8608)|
| 2:23:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8612)|
| 2:23:33| So your commissioner is working for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8613)|
| 2:23:34| Very good, Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8614)|
| 2:23:36| Let me do a little bit of a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8616)|
| 2:23:41| I'm not going to give you the whole history on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8621)|
| 2:23:43| but this was a piece of property that there was a nice ranch house on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8623)|
| 2:23:49| but you couldn't see it from the road because there was a giant hill going up the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| up to where the house set up over the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| I'm not sure whether Ms. Woods can see the house beforehand if the leaves were off the tree or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8638)|
| 2:24:02| but she can certainly see everything now because I've been down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8642)|
| 2:24:08| Kansas Sun does work for KUB and even state agencies on dirt removal and all this kind of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8648)|
| 2:24:19| They have a permit from TDAC to fill this huge gully out front, and it's being monitored now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8659)|
| 2:24:29| Roy Braden and I have had numerous conversations over the last two years about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8669)|
| 2:24:35| and it's pretty much come to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| They went to MPC at the time the sector plan was adopted by MPC unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| and tried to get it changed at that point to commercial, and they were denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| So they have not pushed it any further as far as trying to get the property zone commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8692)|
| 2:25:00| They've given up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| They say they have, and Mr. Seymour, which I think he's already gone, is the attorney for Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8701)|
| 2:25:08| Is he still back there, Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| Am I correct so far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8713)|
| 2:25:14| They have agreed not to do anything with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8714)|
| 2:25:17| What they want to do now is dress it up, which they have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8717)|
| 2:25:20| and mitigate some of the drainage problems that they have caused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8720)|
| 2:25:26| It's going to be difficult to do on the backside because I've been down in that little creek behind Miss Wood's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8726)|
| 2:25:33| down in that little ravine, and when you look up at the top of that rim of the silt pond up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8733)|
| 2:25:42| it's about 60 feet in the air and a pretty good angle of elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8742)|
| 2:25:50| They might be able to get thousand-legged worms to live and hang on that steep bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8750)|
| 2:25:57| but it's going to be difficult to get anything to grow and stay there very long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8757)|
| 2:26:01| which creates a problem for her, and I hate that for her,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| but it's something that, you know, when you own a piece of property, you can cut up to your property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8764)|
| 2:26:10| When you have ag land, you can cut up to your property line, and there's nobody doing anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| I mean, it's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8776)|
| 2:26:17| But they are taking care of getting it landscaped out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8777)|
| 2:26:24| and their plans are right now to rent it out as a rental house, so that's where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8784)|
| 2:26:31| They still will probably do some continuation of their field there, but as Miss Wood's mentioned, they were served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8791)|
| 2:26:41| Roy Braden met with a group from the community last Thursday evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8801)|
| 2:26:45| Commissioner Shouse was there and told us he was serving them with a notice of violation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8805)|
| 2:26:55| They have like ten days or so, whatever it is, to move the equipment, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8815)|
| 2:27:00| they're all in agreement with all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8820)|
| 2:27:02| It's just the fact that some of these things, once you get them started, you can't just stop them overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8822)|
| 2:27:08| It takes a little bit of time to get it taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8828)|
| 2:27:12| There are enough people involved now, whether it's the community members, whether it's the code department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8832)|
| 2:27:19| They are working now with the state T-DEC also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| So there's enough parties involved that I think we will probably resolve this situation as far as that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8842)|
| 2:27:29| But that doesn't have anything to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8849)|
| 2:27:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8851)|
| 2:27:32| Let's get back to the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8852)|
| 2:27:34| That's what is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8854)|
| 2:27:35| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8855)|
| 2:27:37| Mr. Buzz and staff, does this, as my question will go back to, does this have the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8857)|
| 2:27:44| and ridgetop in the plan other than advisory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| Because we voted on it to be advisory and you've placed it in the plan, which makes it law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8868)|
| 2:27:52| So let's --I know my votes are futile probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8872)|
| 2:27:57| The hillside and ridgetop protection area is in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| Help me out here, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8883)|
| 2:28:04| The paragraph in the hillside plan, I believe, says that subsequent documents would not overturn that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8884)|
| 2:28:19| Well, we have incorporated the recommendations of the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8899)|
| 2:28:21| and ridgetop protection plan within the south county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| But it is a plan that is advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| It creates no regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8910)|
| 2:28:32| Future land use decisions made by you, the legislative body, have to be consistent with the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8912)|
| 2:28:39| Otherwise, you're subject to suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8919)|
| 2:28:43| But there's a wide range of actions that can be determined to be consistent with land use plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8923)|
| 2:28:49| So this puts the ridgetop in the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8929)|
| 2:28:53| And again, land use plan can only be changed by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8933)|
| 2:28:57| No, that's not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8937)|
| 2:28:59| The land use plan is a part of the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8939)|
| 2:29:02| which requires approval of the legislative body to make any amendments operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8942)|
| 2:29:09| So that puts the planning commission more or less in an advisory role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8949)|
| 2:29:15| Although the language still says we adopted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8955)|
| 2:29:18| any amendment isn't operative until the legislative body has approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8967)|
| 2:29:30| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8970)|
| 2:29:32| It's been probably first and second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8972)|
| 2:29:35| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8975)|
| 2:29:36| Yes, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| Brad, are you comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| Oh, I'm voting no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8979)|
| 2:29:40| I think that it places it in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8980)|
| 2:29:42| and I think that it becomes too hard for us to mitigate overturning it or disagreeing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8982)|
| 2:29:49| And so I think the plan should have been advisory and not included in any kind of sector plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8989)|
| 2:29:53| And I voted against them all, but nobody's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8993)|
| 2:29:58| He said it was advisory, but they're putting it in the land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=8998)|
| 2:30:02| I mean, he can say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9002)|
| 2:30:03| I mean, I just don't agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| I think it should be an advisory plan in the review process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9004)|
| 2:30:08| and not be legislated and we're legislating it in my opinion, putting it in the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9008)|
| 2:30:14| So I voted against all the sector plans that had it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9014)|
| 2:30:18| And I'll continue to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9018)|
| 2:30:22| What does our law department have to say about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9022)|
| 2:30:24| We're discussing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9024)|
| 2:30:28| It may be a good idea, Mark, to discuss how the South County Sector Plan incorporates the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9028)|
| 2:30:35| or the recommendations or the advisements of the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9035)|
| 2:30:40| The South County Sector Plan includes the geographical area that's described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9040)|
| 2:30:47| in the hillside and ridgetop protection area as a component of the future land use plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9047)|
| 2:30:53| and has a couple of paragraphs that make reference to the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9053)|
| 2:30:59| and ridgetop protection plan recommendations as far as recommended densities for development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9059)|
| 2:31:04| within that protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9064)|
| 2:31:09| But it creates no new regulation and the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9069)|
| 2:31:14| and ridgetop protection plan has already been adopted as part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9074)|
| 2:31:18| The South County Sector Plan is adopted as part of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9078)|
| 2:31:23| Would you, if somebody proposed something inside that ridgetop protection area that was against those advisements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9083)|
| 2:31:31| would you approve it or disapprove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| It's the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9093)|
| 2:31:34| Well, if it's a change of zoning, we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| I didn't ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9096)|
| 2:31:37| I said, would you approve something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| If there was something in the ridgetop, there was no change of zoning, but they had a development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9098)|
| 2:31:43| would you approve it or disapprove it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9103)|
| 2:31:45| Well, we would only see, only have the opportunity to look at a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9105)|
| 2:31:50| if it were already zoned planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9110)|
| 2:31:53| and we would have the existing density condition already in place if it's already zoned planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9113)|
| 2:32:03| And so that is the guidance that we would go by if it's zoned agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9123)|
| 2:32:09| or RA or RB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9129)|
| 2:32:12| We don't see those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9132)|
| 2:32:14| If they request a change in zoning, then it's the legislative body that approves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom121119?start=9134)|
