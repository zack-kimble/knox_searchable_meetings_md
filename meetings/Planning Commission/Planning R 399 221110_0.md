| 0:15:42| Seeing no lights. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=942)|
| 0:15:52| Okay, got to regroup here. You got some slipsheets for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=952)|
| 0:16:09| Bear with us just a moment while we pull these files off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=969)|
| 0:16:14| Okay, all right, that's what I got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| Okay, got it, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=982)|
| 0:16:38| Okay, we ready? Okay, we will start with item number 14. The applicant is City of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=998)|
| 0:16:49| location north side of Hillwood Drive, west of Island Home Avenue, east of Dexter Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| The approximate size track, 0.66 acres. Present plan and zoning designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| mixed use special district, south waterfront, hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| south waterfront, hillside protection overlay. Proposed plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| is medium density residential, hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1033)|
| 0:17:17| Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment to MDRO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1037)|
| 0:17:28| medium density residential office and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| because it is consistent with the adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1051)|
| 0:17:46| Okay, here we go. Approve the one-year plan. The second motion required is approve the one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1066)|
| 0:18:00| plan amendment to south waterfront mixed use district two and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| because it is consistent with adjacent development. The third motion would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| approve RN5, general residential neighborhood and hillside protection overlay zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| because it is a minor extension of the adjacent zone district. All right, is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1096)|
| 0:18:34| Hello, RJ Justice, City of Knoxville, 400 West Maine. Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| Seeing no opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| Okay, would you like to defer, Ms. Justice, or proceed? Just proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1127)|
| 0:19:00| I apologize if this isn't the time for this particular concern. I know that this is being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| rezoned. Ma'am, if you don't care, could you pull your mic down? There's a button on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| table. Okay, there you go. Thanks. All right, fantastic. Thank you. My concern is with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| traffic on this street. The recommendation for this plot of land says that there wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1157)|
| 0:19:21| any impact to traffic. So excuse me if this isn't the right time to talk about it. Should I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1161)|
| 0:19:27| Sure. Okay, great. So as you can see across the way, there's the Island Home Rehabilitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| Center. There's ambulances and medical vehicles that go in and out of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1172)|
| 0:19:39| My house, now everybody here can know where I live, is right next door to the property, to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Island Home Rehabilitation. I'm curious how there's going to be no impact to traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1185)|
| 0:19:53| You can't tell from this view, but this is on a hill, and there are people that run off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| this street all the time. So I'm hoping that there's some sort of consideration being made for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1199)|
| 0:20:06| the traffic on the driveways that are on Hillwood right there, and then also the medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| vehicles that go in and out of that. So that's my only opposition to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1212)|
| 0:20:18| Thank you for your comments. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Ms. Justice, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| Yes, and thanks for your concerns and the question, and I will say this. We are taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| into consideration the impact of development here, and the City purchased two parcels on either side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1233)|
| 0:20:40| of Hillwood in the past in anticipation of future development, and for the purpose of making roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1240)|
| 0:20:48| improvements. To take those concerns into consideration, we are going to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1248)|
| 0:20:54| take those concerns into consideration. So part of the background for the request here is to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1254)|
| 0:21:04| the engineering improvements, stormwater improvements, curb improvements, and do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1264)|
| 0:21:11| whole redo of Hillwood. So that's kind of a whole other project, but yes, we are taking all of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1271)|
| 0:21:18| into consideration to answer your question, and I can talk to you in further detail about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| Sure. Thank you. All right, let's open it up to the Commission floor. Any comments? Entertain a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1283)|
| 0:21:34| Commissioner, I'd make a motion that we approve the South City Sector Plan amendment per staff's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| recommendation. So I second. We got a motion by Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1298)|
| 0:21:47| Adams. Okay, seeing no lights, all in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1307)|
| 0:21:57| Chair, I'd like to make a motion to approve the one-year plan amendment per staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1317)|
| 0:22:03| Second. All right, we have a motion to approve the one-year plan amendment by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1323)|
| 0:22:10| Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Uten. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1330)|
| 0:22:17| Chairman, I'd like to make a motion to approve the rezoning to RN-5 general residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1337)|
| 0:22:22| neighborhood and hillside protection per staff's recommendation. Second. We've got a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| Commissioner Phillips, seconded by Vice Chair Uten to approve the rezoning per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1348)|
| 0:22:36| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1356)|
| 0:22:50| All right, we'll move on to agenda item 16, the applicant is Rivers Edge 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| Location, north side of Hillwood Drive, west side of Island Home Avenue. Approximate size of track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| 4.46 acres. Present plan and zoning designation is mixed-use special district, south waterfront| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1381)|
| 0:23:11| and hillside protection. And the zoning designation is SW2 south waterfront with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| hillside protection overlay. Proposed plan designation, medium density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1398)|
| 0:23:23| hillside protection. Staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1403)|
| 0:23:31| to medium density residential office and hillside protection because it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| with adjacent development. We have the second motion would be to approve the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1416)|
| 0:23:44| amendment to south waterfront mixed-use district 2 and hillside protection because it's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1424)|
| 0:23:49| with adjacent development. And then the third required motion would be approve the RN-5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| general residential neighborhood and hillside protection overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| uh zoning because it provides a transitional zone district. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1439)|
| 0:24:08| Hello, Sean Schalmers, Dominion Group, 3834 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| Thank you. Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| Okay, let's see, we had someone remove this. Same person. Okay, any, would you like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1454)|
| 0:24:31| any comments? No? Okay, all right. Please proceed, Mr. Jones. I'll defer to the staff's recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1471)|
| 0:24:40| Okay, very well. Let's see, all right. Commissioner Midas. Hi, I have a question for you. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1480)|
| 0:24:50| And this is more, this is geared towards rezoning. Why do you request the RN-5 as opposed to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1490)|
| 0:24:57| current zoning? It's something we've explored. We've had this property for a while. I'm familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| with the south waterfront code and as we've talked with the city and planning staff on two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1502)|
| 0:25:06| One, the kind of rework that's planned for Hillwood that they'd like to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| namely around some of the safety issues that are there and then how the site fronts that road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1510)|
| 0:25:15| how basically the south waterfront code would affect that and how the RN code would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| allow us to develop within that code. I don't know if that answers your question, but it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1520)|
| 0:25:26| basically there's some challenges around the south waterfront code with the way that Hillwood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1526)|
| 0:25:31| currently is. What challenges specifically? One of the main issues is regarding access off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1531)|
| 0:25:38| of frontage roads and in the south waterfront code, one of the main issues is that you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| have a driveway off the frontage road. So in essence, it would require an additional public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1542)|
| 0:25:47| road to be installed. If you look on the map there on the north side, we previously developed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1547)|
| 0:25:55| site and that splendid view court was installed to basically adhere within that code. Due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1555)|
| 0:26:03| topography and the shape of our site in question here off of Hillwood, that would be very challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| and we would argue that it's not really a public benefit to have the city invest in a road like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| that. So that's one of the main challenges among several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1573)|
| 0:26:27| And do you have a plan already drawn up as to what you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| We have drawn up a concept plan that we presented at some neighborhood meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| It's early concept, but yes, we do have an initial concept. I don't have it with me here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1596)|
| 0:26:44| I guess my concern is just the timing, you know, since you aren't far along in the project, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1604)|
| 0:26:51| sure exactly if that's going to be an issue or not. There's still a lot of issues with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1611)|
| 0:26:56| the road construction, you know, maybe that maybe this isn't the appropriate zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| Maybe they wouldn't be that restrictive. We've gotten to this place after consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| city and planning staff and talking about the future for Hillwood. And so what we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1626)|
| 0:27:12| advised is, you know, we need to go through this process alongside with the city to get to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| next step of looking at Hillwood. One of the things that we're offering the city is to actually be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| flexible on our property boundary to allow them to potentially widen Hillwood to make it safer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| And so we're kind of walking in that process with the city on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| The rezoning being kind of the first step in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1654)|
| 0:27:42| Mr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| In terms of the widening of Hillwood, which is today, is there any plan or discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1664)|
| 0:27:51| at this stage of the game that that widening might include a sidewalk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I think that has been discussed. I'd probably defer to RJ maybe to talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| representing the city. But I think that's still to be developed. But yeah, the goal would be to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| make Hillwood wider and safer. But we're not going to be able to determine what that profile is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| being the private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| Commissioner Schelso.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| Is the city selling the other parcel to you guys for the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| We've been in conversations of working a transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| So if there's going to be some negotiation over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1711)|
| 0:28:36| building a sidewalk, I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| I think it's code driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| Well, I mean, if the city has a piece of property that we're looking to sell, that's the public's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| property to negotiate with, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| Yeah. So, Rebecca Justice, City of Knoxville, Commissioner Adams. Yes, we have had two public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1730)|
| 0:28:58| meetings now to get some feedback from the community on just how the road is functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1738)|
| 0:29:03| and not functioning. I think we all know it's not been functioning for a very long time. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| we're very hopeful that we will be able to include in the cross section, improve travel lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| improve site distance, and some sort of multimodal path, whether it's a sidewalk or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| greenway to connect into the existing infrastructure in South Knoxville. And as for conveying or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1757)|
| 0:29:25| selling property, when we buy parcels like this with the intention of for right away improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1765)|
| 0:29:33| we typically convey any remnant property to adjacent landowners just on case by case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| So that's kind of the merit behind our request for the rezoning alongside of Dominion and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| speak to Commissioner Midas, is this the right time in order for them to continue to plan any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| of that remnant parcel into their concepts? We were kind of going in tandem to think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| whole area together. So, yeah, my point was the public has a piece of property that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1799)|
| 0:30:07| be part of this and is negotiating, I would think, to work on public amenities. So it sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1807)|
| 0:30:13| So I'd like to make the motion to approve the sector plan amendment to MDRO and hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1813)|
| 0:30:21| protection because it's consistent with the adjacent development. Second. We have a motion by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| Commissioner Schelso, seconded by Commissioner Adams to approve the sector amendment per staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| recommendation. Seeing no lights, all in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1835)|
| 0:30:45| Let's see, we've got two more motions here. Chairman Hill, I'd like to make a motion to approve the one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1845)|
| 0:30:49| plan amendment per staff recommendation. Second. Okay, we have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| seconded by Commissioner Schelso to approve the one-year plan amendment for staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries. Chairman Hill, I'd like to make a motion to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| R.N. 5 residential neighborhood and hillside protection overlay per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1868)|
| 0:31:14| Second. Motion by Commissioner Phillips to approve the R.N. 5 per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1874)|
| 0:31:20| seconded by Commissioner Schelso. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? We have one no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1880)|
| 0:31:33| Thank you. We'll move on to item number 19, the applicant. Steps House location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1893)|

| 0:32:04| an existing 10-unit apartment building subject to two conditions. Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1924)|
| 0:32:20| Jody McClurg, the CEO of Steps House, currently reside at 2027 Lincoln Street. Thank you. Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1940)|
| 0:32:29| Would, uh, please proceed. So, um, basically we have grown, Steps House has grown in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1949)|
| 0:32:40| We've, we, um, started in 1991. Uh, this November the 21st will be 31 years of being, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1960)|
| 0:32:51| in, uh, in business. So what we want to do is use this for, um, we want to be in compliance with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| we want to be in compliance with Tennessee Department of Corrections and, um, so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1977)|
| 0:33:03| house the, the clients that are coming out of jails and prisons and on probation and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| like that. We want to be able to, to house those clients and it'll be, this particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1987)|
| 0:33:13| will be stage two of the, of the program. So stage one, they will be living with us on Boggs Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| which is about 0.8 miles adjacent to, to Moody, uh, over on Davenport. And, uh, once they complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=1999)|
| 0:33:25| the first part of the program, uh, the 60 to 90 days, we will move them over to the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2005)|
| 0:33:32| They have to get, uh, they have to be full-time employed, working, get a job, do everything that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| required that a normal citizen would do. And we'll get them back into, um, functioning the way that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| the way that, uh, society wants them to function. Um, most of the clients will be on supervised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2023)|
| 0:33:47| probation that, that'll be residing there. And this will give, also give us an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2027)|
| 0:33:54| be able to control what happens there. Uh, we can, we can do recovery housing, which means that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| we can, uh, follow the guidelines of Knoxville and, and hold as many clients in a room as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| guys would let us. But if we have, uh, the pathway house, it gives us guidelines to go by. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| able to, um, control what happens there and being able to watch exactly what's going on. And there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| will also be staff living on site. So like I said, Steps House has been around for 31 years. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| a homeless veterans program. We serve 45 homeless veterans. It'll also be used to house veterans if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| we don't have, uh, room for them in the regular GPD program. So in all around, uh, I think it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| uh, worth giving it a shot. Thank you. Commissioner Adams. Thanks. Um, thank you so much, Mr. McClurg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2076)|
| 0:34:46| for talking. Um, I have a few questions. I asked for this to come off of consent because I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2086)|
| 0:34:53| to learn more about the program that you have in place for the halfway house and your experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| in terms of serving that particular population. Okay. Um, but in your, um, statements, you said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2098)|
| 0:35:05| that the residents would first live at the Boggs facility. Is that currently a halfway house? It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2105)|
| 0:35:11| It is, it is, uh, it was a group home. It was grandfathered in years ago. So we've been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2111)|
| 0:35:14| for, it's been 31 years since that started there. So that is, and the staff that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| they're licensed, we're licensed staff with the late acts and things like that. So they're,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| we're trained, all the staff are trained, but yes, that is a facility that we have. That is also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| where the GPD program is located. So go ahead. No, that's, um, that was not clear, at least to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2127)|
| 0:35:35| in the application that Boggs is currently a halfway house. Um, because part of my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2135)|
| 0:35:41| based on the application, it seemed that there was a great deal of experience in sober living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| and in drug and alcohol, uh, abuse rehabilitation, but I didn't see the, um, halfway house movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| from the criminal system into transitional housing. But Boggs is part of your experience in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| in that area. Yes. Um, the other question I had was about those, uh, program case managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2159)|
| 0:36:08| their training. What, the application indicated that they were trained in the drug and alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2168)|
| 0:36:15| uh, abuse, uh, counseling, but is there any specific, um, I guess training that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2175)|
| 0:36:22| goes into their management of the persons coming directly from the prison system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| Jesse, so you're asking what training that the case managers has to deal with folks that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| just coming out? Is that what you're asking? Yeah, and what I'm getting at is just understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| kind of the, I'm assuming that there are differences in terms of what those different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| those individuals may need, and so the counselors, how they are equipped to take care of persons who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2202)|
| 0:36:48| are in that particular transitional mode. Okay, so most of the counselors that, that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| or LADACs has experienced some sort of addiction issues themselves, and they have experienced the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| life that, that, that these folks are currently experiencing. So for us, we, we, uh, like for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| to, well, it's, it is mandatory that you have been in absence of any mood-altering symptoms for at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| least two years to apply to work for Steps House, but we like folks to work for us that's struggled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| with addiction in the past, and we also have folks that work for us that's not struggled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| addiction, but if you have struggled with that, then you will know exactly how to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| with what goes on, on a day-to-day basis with those particular clients. So, you know, the ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| that work there, 80% of the staff has been in that predicament. The other ones are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2253)|
| 0:37:41| college graduates that are clinical social workers, LADACs, and CPRSs, which is peer support specialists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| that are working. So a pretty good handle on what they need to be looking at when they come out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| the, uh, the system. Um, I, I guess my question isn't about, uh, their expertise in terms of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2273)|
| 0:38:00| substance abuse. Um, I think your 30 years of experience there really speaks to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| understanding that. My question's coming more from the, the halfway house component and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2285)|
| 0:38:11| criminal system, and I don't know if there's a differentiation there that can be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| but I'm just looking for some of that particular expertise for circumstances that those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| individuals might have, might be facing as opposed to someone who is strictly dealing with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| substance abuse issue. So there is clients, there is clients that we get sometimes that's more, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| that are a little more difficult to deal with. However, we have certain, uh, folks that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| partnered with us that we use, Helen Ross McNabb. Um, UT partners with us to, to, we are actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| training facility for UT. Um, they come over and, uh, they send the, um, people to train with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| there and we train them to do that. But I don't really know how to answer your question other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2330)|
| 0:38:56| than to say that the experience that you experienced living through that is, is how you begin to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2336)|
| 0:39:03| how to handle those situations. And that's really the only thing that I would know to say other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| than using our clinical staff. Uh, like I said, using the licensed clinical social workers, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| LADACs and things like that who knows the brain chemistry of what drugs do to your brain and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| can deal with those situations. And sometimes it requires hospitalization and, uh, other times, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| know, 30 day treatment in, um, in house somewhere. Um, let me ask one more question and maybe this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2363)|
| 0:39:30| is getting at it in a different way. Um, because, uh, at the, at the end of part of the case file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2370)|
| 0:39:41| that the planning commission had, uh, to review, there was a comment about that if this did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2381)|
| 0:39:49| pass in terms of the halfway house, that it would become a group home akin to the Valley and Boggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| and Sevier properties and that there would be limited supervision and no program requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2396)|
| 0:40:06| if that was the case, which made me want to ask if there have been any problems, uh, associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| with the Valley and Boggs and Sevier locations if they have limited supervision and no program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| requirements. Well, I've experienced no problem with those. Like I said, for 31 years, we've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| we've been in business there in that location. Um, and I think that the, the only thing, the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| reason why that was spoken of was in the application somewhere. I think it asked for an alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| plan of what we would use that facility for. Um, and that the alternative plan would of course be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2434)|
| 0:40:40| uh, we would have to use it for housing. But the reason that we was pushing for the halfway is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| because we have more of a control on that issue. Um, otherwise they just be reading from us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2444)|
| 0:40:50| that's not what we want. We want an actual program that they have to come in and work that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2450)|
| 0:40:54| in order to reside there. And if they don't work that program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| it gives us the opportunity to be able to say you can't live here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2456)|
| 0:41:02| Okay. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| Commissioner, you ready to go? Go ahead. Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| You said not, not working the program. Does that mean that you do regular drug tests if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2472)|
| 0:41:18| commit a crime? What is it that? Uh, most of the clients are on supervised probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| We do do random drug screens to ensure program compliance. We provide structural program and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| residents are required to work and participate in a day program when they first arrive at Steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2488)|

| 0:42:28| service and I make a motion that we approve per staff recommendation. Second. I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2548)|

| 0:44:06| Would you like to defer, Ms. Patterson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2646)|

| 0:44:22| to the parking lot change. It's just that it caught me by surprise, and I apologize for not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| talking to you guys and finding out all the details about it, but my only concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| several, but the church has already done an extensive amount of clearing and grubbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2674)|
| 0:44:39| development of the property, which runs entirely, I don't know, a quarter of a mile down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2679)|

| 0:44:52| about lighting from the parking lot. If there is going to be any change or additional lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2692)|
| 0:44:58| the whole project has gradually, over time, gotten bigger, took us all by surprise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2698)|
| 0:45:03| kind of like that gas line project out there. It's gotten really big, but I think probably this lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| can answer my questions real easy, but I'd like to reserve the right to be opposed to this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2710)|
| 0:45:20| if I'm not happy with what I hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| So I guess you'll reserve time. We'll reserve your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| remaining time in the event that you want to oppose it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2731)|
| 0:45:40| Okay, I guess I'll just kind of describe what's happening here, just for clarification. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| the church is asking for a parking lot expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2747)|
| 0:45:55| From the plans we've submitted, they have outgrown their space, so they are in the works of getting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2755)|
| 0:46:05| new sanctuary. They don't have those plans together at this time, but we do know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2765)|
| 0:46:12| just as you can tell from the topography, the parking that is adjacent to the existing sanctuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2772)|
| 0:46:19| on the left, that is where the new sanctuary will go. Because of that, all of that parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2779)|
| 0:46:28| which I think is about 114 spaces, will be removed. Right now, they already are doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2788)|
| 0:46:35| I believe, five services on Sunday to keep up with their members. So in order to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2795)|
| 0:46:43| the loss of 114 parking spaces, we wanted to go ahead and propose a parking expansion so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2803)|
| 0:46:50| when the sanctuary comes into play, they aren't without that many spaces, especially since they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2810)|
| 0:46:56| already in need. We've worked with staff on this, and we're in agreement with their recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2816)|
| 0:47:03| to basically where we would go ahead and do the work on the parking lot, and then it won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2823)|
| 0:47:11| able to be used until the construction of the new sanctuary comes into play. That way, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| kind of like a phasing, and we will come back before you, obviously, for the new sanctuary as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| well. I do want to speak about, I guess, the lighting. Parking lot lights aren't allowed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2843)|
| 0:47:33| face out, really. You know, it's pretty dim lighting, as opposed to like a baseball stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2853)|
| 0:47:39| or something like that. Also, the topo, as it sits, you can see we have a proposed wall in the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| It is way below where that gas line easement goes through it. It'll be at the bottom of the hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2866)|
| 0:47:53| so it won't be, I guess, up on a hill where residents should be able to see it from behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2873)|
| 0:48:06| Mr. Hunger, would you like to speak? I guess not. So, if I heard you correct, I couldn't hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| everything you said, but it's my understanding this is a temporary parking lot until the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| sanctuary is completed. Is that correct? It'll be a permanent lot, but right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2898)|
| 0:48:25| it will, they'll just be able to pave it so that, like, they already have the crews, so they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2905)|
| 0:48:29| to go ahead. Ms. Patterson, could you step up to the microphone? So, it will be a permanent lot, but right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2909)|
| 0:48:38| we're just getting the special use approval. It'll still have to go through, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| city engineering, all of the regular reviews, but it will be a permanent lot. It'll just be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2922)|
| 0:48:50| paved and blocked off until the new sanctuary is approved and starts being constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| So, the total change in parking lot spaces or cars predicted is no change or some increase or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2938)|
| 0:49:09| roughly what are we talking about? So, with the current assembly, we have, we're allowed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2949)|
| 0:49:17| 394 spaces. They currently have 200 and 304. We're currently at 298, so they're allowed to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| you know, just a few more right now, and then once the new sanctuary is built and it will see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| more people, so then the parking that we've designed here falls within the new parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2970)|
| 0:49:35| maximums that will come into play once there's a new assembly. So, it will increase the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2975)|
| 0:49:44| Let me double check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| If you guys are going to approve this anyway, it's okay. I understand, but I just got caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2989)|
| 0:49:55| with my pants down. I understand. I just didn't know about it, and I'm most concerned of all with any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| thoughts you have and plans in the future about any ingress and egress onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3001)|
| 0:50:07| on to Topside Road from Masterson Road, which is an old county road. That I don't want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| And we tried that before, and it did not go through, so they are not pursuing that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3013)|
| 0:50:22| Believe me, that was going to get a lot of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| All right, let's take this to the commission floor and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3024)|
| 0:50:31| Commissioner Rolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3031)|

| 0:50:42| It says for subject to three conditions, I only see two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| That's a clerical error. There's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| The conditions are that they meet all applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| requirements of the zoning ordinance, especially the off-street parking requirements of Article 11.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3057)|
| 0:51:04| and the Knoxville Department of Engineering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| Gotcha. Okay, I'll make a motion to approve the proposed parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3068)|
| 0:51:13| for staff recommendations subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3073)|

| 0:52:18| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| The staff recommendation is to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| and hillside protection because the property meets the location criteria for rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3147)|

| 0:53:45| You see where it's highlighted right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3225)|
| 0:53:48| That house on the up corner, that's my house right there and we've been there 22 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3228)|
| 0:53:53| and the way I understand it, he's wanting to put a house on the hill back there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| we have that one driveway to entry, you know, to get back and forth and I got a piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3237)|
| 0:54:02| paper on my deed that allows that, I guess, an addendum or an easement for me to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3242)|
| 0:54:08| and out as long as I help maintain it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3248)|
| 0:54:10| So, I just don't know how it's safe to have all them cars coming down that driveway if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| something comes up or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| One house that he's got going now, I mean, I don't have a problem with or maybe even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| another one but to put four houses in that little spot on two acres, no, it just doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3261)|
| 0:54:26| make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3266)|
| 0:54:27| Safety-wise, as far as the road goes and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| West Ford Valley Road is a two-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| Our driveway is one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3273)|
| 0:54:34| Just yesterday, I followed my neighbor home and she turned in, stopped at the end of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| road to check her mail and now I'm stuck at the road waiting on her to check her mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| Cars are backing up behind me, you know, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| So, that's what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3284)|
| 0:54:46| Just congestion, mainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3286)|
| 0:54:49| So, that's really all I got on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Yes, I'm asking this be approved to subdivide it and the back lot has a entry on the back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3293)|
| 0:55:14| of right-of-way for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| Now, Mr. Brewer showed me a paper that said that he could use my driveway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3317)|
| 0:55:27| I have not, it's not on my deed, but I've allowed it and he also has several vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3327)|
| 0:55:37| parked on my property, which I have allowed, just trying to be a good neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| So, I'm not going to change the paper, but everything is in accordance to the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| and working with my surveyor of the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3353)|
| 0:55:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3356)|
| 0:55:57| Commissioner Rolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3357)|
| 0:55:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3358)|
| 0:56:00| That driveway, is that a recorded joint permanent easement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3360)|
| 0:56:12| Who's, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3372)|
| 0:56:20| According to the plat, there is a 25-foot joint permanent easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3380)|
| 0:56:24| on that property where the driveway is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| You know, the JPE, the maximum number of homes we can have on a JPE is five, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| Yes, under the old JPE, there was a maximum of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3393)|
| 0:56:39| Anything over five, you had to meet road standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Five or less, it was reduced standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3401)|
| 0:56:48| I will say, too, that there is a plat that's going through the process right now for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3408)|
| 0:56:53| properties, and so we'll ensure that, you know, to add those properties that it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| comply with current subdivision regulations and what would be required for those easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| And currently, it has one on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3421)|
| 0:57:08| Currently, there's only one house on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Currently, it has the driveway that you see, and it looks like the neighboring property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| also uses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| The, maybe 320?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3440)|
| 0:57:21| If you could turn on the aerial view, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| So, if there's two on it, we really can't?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3445)|
| 0:57:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3448)|
| 0:57:28| So, the first lot uses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| It crosses through that lot to get to the rear lot, the 326.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| So, the lot that we count is using that easement is 326, and then, I guess, 320 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| So, they could use an SPAE, the shared permanent access easement, the new one that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| created, or a private right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3465)|
| 0:57:46| Either one of those would work to service this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3466)|
| 0:57:50| Under the SPAE, a fire truck turnaround may be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| That would be determined by the fire marshal's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| By the future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| But my question is, if there's two people, two houses using it now, we really can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| approve four, correct, on this lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3484)|
| 0:58:09| Well, right now, it's just the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| So, yeah, the plot would come through at a different time, and if it's less than six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| then you all wouldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| If I'm seeing this correctly, so the opposition is house 320 right there, but then also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| parcel in front of them, you know, next to, in front of 320, yeah, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3510)|
| 0:58:39| Is that also owned by the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3522)|
| 0:58:42| So, if the driveway...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| Yeah, I bought it 22 years ago from the Whiteheads, and they've both died since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3524)|
| 0:58:50| He bought it, I don't know, five, six years back or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3530)|
| 0:58:54| But, yeah, I've been using that driveway since we moved in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| I was just curious, if the driveway was too narrow or a problem, you could...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| In order to get past each other, you've got to drive on my grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| Okay, is there a way that maybe you all could work together, since you own that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| to widen the driveway into your property, or maybe have your own private?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| You can't see it, but we've got telephone poles lining that whole driveway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| If I put a new driveway in my property, that eats up half that, because I own that whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3560)|
| 0:59:25| lot right there, but it'll eat up half of that, and you can't, I won't be able to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| nothing there, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3569)|
| 0:59:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3570)|
| 0:59:30| If I ever build, which I don't really want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3573)|
| 0:59:34| Yeah, it's just a one-lane driveway, but we've been using it forever, you know, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| that's going to, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| So, that's my only thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Commissioner Shesol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3581)|
| 0:59:43| Michelle, so if it's, if there's a 25-foot easement, but it's not currently built out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3583)|
| 0:59:49| to accommodate traffic very well, would that be the upgrade to this driveway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3589)|
| 0:59:55| Is there any requirement for that in the subdivision rules, besides if the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| deems it required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3601)|
| 1:00:02| So, it depends on how they plot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| If they plot it as the shared, the SPAE, that only requires a 25-foot width for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| right-of-way, and then if it's a private right-of-way, then it would be required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| be 40 feet, so they would need a variance to have 25 feet at the road frontage to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| to 40 at some point when they would be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| In terms of the pavement width, that's all looked at engineering when the plot comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| through, so if they determined that it needed to be widened, then that would be a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3625)|
| 1:00:29| that the engineering department would provide to the surveyor at the time of the plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3629)|
| 1:00:33| Given that information, I think, you know, the concerns on the driveway sound like they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| be addressed in some one way or another, so I'd like to make a motion to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential, because it meets the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| criteria for rural residential and is consistent with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3648)|
| 1:00:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| Commissioner Schell, so, I hate to ask you to do this, but I didn't hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3655)|
| 1:00:59| Could you repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Motion to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential, because, per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| Okay, so we've got a motion by Commissioner Schell, so, seconded by Commissioner Higgins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3666)|
| 1:01:13| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| We need...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| Oh, here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3699)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| Chair will entertain a second motion to approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3709)|
| 1:01:51| So we have a motion by Commissioner Schell, so, to approve the rezoning, per staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| seconded by Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3713)|
| 1:01:55| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3717)|
| 1:01:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3719)|
| 1:02:01| And motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3723)|
| 1:02:05| We'll move on to agenda item 26.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3725)|
| 1:02:07| Applicant is David Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| Present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| The location is west of Leg Lane, north of Millertown Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3733)|
| 1:02:15| Tract information is 3.06 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3735)|
| 1:02:17| Present plan designation and zoning is agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| Hillside protection and agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| Proposed plan designation and zoning is rural residential, hillside protection, and planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3741)|
| 1:02:25| Existing land use is rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3745)|
| 1:02:27| Density proposed is 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3747)|
| 1:02:29| And this will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| The first being approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential and hillside protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| because the property will be used by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| And the second is to approve the sector plan amendment to rural residential and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| and hillside protection because the property meets the location criteria for rural residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| and is consistent with the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3775)|
| 1:02:58| And the second motion would be approve the planned residential zone with a maximum density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3778)|
| 1:03:03| of one dwelling unit per acre because it is more consistent with surrounding development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3783)|
| 1:03:08| the proposed land use designation, and the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3788)|
| 1:03:12| Is the applicant available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3792)|
| 1:03:15| I just want to add that the proposed density is two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3795)|
| 1:03:20| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3800)|
| 1:03:24| I said 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3804)|
| 1:03:29| We need density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3809)|
| 1:03:32| Okay, I'll correct that to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3812)|
| 1:03:42| Let's say you, applicant, Mr. Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3822)|
| 1:03:45| Yes, we are seeking two dwelling units per acre and we are seeking the second plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| He didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Excuse me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| State your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| I'm David Hutchins, Hutchins Associates, PC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3839)|
| 1:04:03| I'm at 4625 Newcomb Avenue here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3843)|
| 1:04:11| Do we have any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3851)|
| 1:04:17| Seeing no opposition, please proceed, Mr. Hutchins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Yeah, this site has hillside protection on part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3861)|
| 1:04:26| It's fairly long and narrow, three acres running up a ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3866)|
| 1:04:30| It's relatively flat toward the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3870)|
| 1:04:35| There is an existing house that's been renovated at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| And what we're seeking under the sector plan amendment is the flexibility with rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3881)|
| 1:04:49| of being able to do a more clustered development and leave as much of the steeper slopes available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3889)|
| 1:05:00| for use by the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3900)|
| 1:05:05| So we would build on the lower slope and then leave the upper slope for the benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3905)|
| 1:05:13| of all the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3913)|
| 1:05:16| Commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| Wouldn't the, I mean, you still have the ability to build on the flat portion of the land and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3921)|
| 1:05:30| keep the slopes the way they are with the recommendation from staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| Could you ask, I'm sorry, could you ask again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| What's the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| No, your last comment was that you wanted to have the increased density so that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| could cluster the development on the flat portion of the land, reserving the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| for the residents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| And I said that you could still do that with the density that staff had recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3952)|
| 1:05:58| I wouldn't preclude you from only building on the flat portion of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| Well, of course you could, but you can't get as many units on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3961)|
| 1:06:06| And I mean, to me, that lot will support, it will support more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3966)|
| 1:06:13| There's, you know, there is higher density in other areas there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3973)|
| 1:06:16| There's a, two units are approved for the property contiguous at the front, if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| all the way up to Millertown, to take that arrowhead to the left or down, it's that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3983)|
| 1:06:32| I think it's that property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| It's the one up, it's the one up from that, if you, yeah, that one has, I think is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=3996)|
| 1:06:44| for, at least I just looked at it, had two dwelling units per acre, of course across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4004)|
| 1:06:52| the street is four, there you go, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| And then I don't know what the LDR was on the site plan that I had or the plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4016)|
| 1:07:04| I had, but that was in front of, directly in front of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4024)|
| 1:07:10| And then of course Ely Park is across the road and it's at four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| We petitioned, filled out a petition to KUB, sanitary is available, which is why Ely Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4037)|
| 1:07:25| has the density that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| We asked them for a capacity study, they did it and they said that they could accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| six, six units on our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4052)|
| 1:07:36| That would cause us to have to extend the sewer a little bit over 900 feet to our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4056)|
| 1:07:45| and then develop the sanitary network within the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4065)|
| 1:07:52| In doing so, obviously there's cost that has to be distributed and the way that that works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| from economics is that you need more units to make that, to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4079)|
| 1:08:07| So three would work with drain field, but if you get beyond that, it's challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4087)|
| 1:08:20| But there's a break point in there where it's no longer viable to extend the sewer and six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4100)|
| 1:08:26| is on the low end of what would be possible if you're running sanitary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4106)|
| 1:08:35| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| Commissioner Rolfe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4118)|
| 1:08:39| Thank you Mr. Chairman, I'm curious and maybe Ms. Hillman can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4119)|
| 1:08:48| Under MAG they can do one dwelling unit per acre, so why rezone it if we're going to re-recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4128)|
| 1:08:56| one unit per acre, I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| That is my question, and I certainly understand, although we probably shouldn't be making decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4139)|
| 1:09:08| based on economics, but I do understand that running the sewer a long way is expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4148)|
| 1:09:12| and I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4152)|
| 1:09:13| But I'm kind of curious as to why staff would recommend to go with rural residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4153)|
| 1:09:18| keep the same density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4158)|
| 1:09:19| Sir, if I may, I agree with you entirely, there's no reason for us, other than the configuration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4159)|
| 1:09:28| we could do some different things under RP with the configuration versus having one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| each acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| So that does give you some level of benefit, but that's a marginal benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| You know, if you're going to go to all the effort, you know, tell me you're only going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| to give me three and we're not going to go for the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| So I would agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| So the benefit isn't just to this property, if the sewer is extended, and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4192)|
| 1:09:58| to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4198)|
| 1:09:59| So it makes other continuous properties more valuable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4199)|
| 1:10:05| Ms. Hillman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4208)|
| 1:10:09| So rural residential is what was requested to allow consideration of PR at two dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4209)|
| 1:10:16| units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| However, in the Northeast County Sector Plan, rural residential recommends PR at a dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| unit density no greater than one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4223)|
| 1:10:27| That is a recommended zoning program versus the agricultural land use designation where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4227)|
| 1:10:32| that can be considered, but it's not recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Since it was already requested that they go to rural residential, there was no, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4237)|
| 1:10:44| according to the criteria for a land use amendment, it met that criteria, but the density requested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4244)|
| 1:10:53| we found that it did not meet the criteria for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| However, planned residential is advantageous because you can cluster development within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| that one dwelling unit per acre standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| I'm having a little bit of trouble hearing everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| So I think what I just heard was rural residential does not allow for two units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| It is not recommended in the Northeast County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4273)|
| 1:11:15| It's not recommended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4275)|
| 1:11:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4276)|
| 1:11:17| But we could still do it if we want to, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| So the commission could make that, Commissioner Roth, the commissioner could make that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Staff is bound by the plans that are out there, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| But the commission could recommend it if we felt like it was the appropriate thing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| Also, Jessie, did you redistribute the hillside protection information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| Yeah, so the slope analysis that was conducted was missing the non-hillside dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| that was discovered moments before this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| The critical piece of the slope analysis really is the disturbance budget, and with the recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4315)|
| 1:12:04| density calculations, also considering the growth policy plan and what's realistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4324)|
| 1:12:09| possible in terms of dwelling unit density within that criteria, the total density could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| be 1.3 dwelling units per acre in the recommended density instead of 1.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4336)|
| 1:12:24| Yeah, that's the original, which is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4349)|
| 1:12:30| That actually calculates out to 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| Yeah, so if you add 2 dwelling units to the non-hillside portion and revise the 15% slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| section to 2, it equals 1.3 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| The critical piece of the slope analysis is the disturbance budget, which is 0.8 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4375)|

| 1:13:21| I just have a question for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4401)|
| 1:13:23| I was looking at the street view, and it kind of looks like there's a house on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| front, but are there also two cabins already on the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4408)|
| 1:13:33| There's a cabin at the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4413)|
| 1:13:34| I think the other two are probably utility structures, sheds, and the cabin's not in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4414)|
| 1:13:45| great shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| The house at the bottom's been renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4430)|

| 1:15:40| The applicant is Masana Investments, location, west side of Fairview Road, eastern terminus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| of Beeler Farms Lane, approximate acreage, 95.83 acres, zoning plan residential, floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4546)|
| 1:15:54| existing land use, vacant, proposed use, detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4554)|
| 1:15:59| Number of lots, 126.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| There will be some subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| Staff recommendation is to deny the concept plan because the proposal is not harmonious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| with the existing development, as outlined below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| And motion two, staff recommendation, deny the development plan based on the denial recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| of the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4582)|
| 1:16:25| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4585)|
| 1:16:27| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939, and I'm assuming there's opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4587)|
| 1:16:34| so I yield to the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4599)|
| 1:16:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| Because there's a lot of moving parts to this one, with access and number of lots and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4602)|
| 1:16:50| sort of thing, would it be appropriate to have staff and the Highway Department just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4610)|
| 1:16:54| comment on their recommendation and what's going on here just so we can get the, I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4614)|
| 1:17:00| here Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4620)|
| 1:17:01| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| If that's your wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4622)|
| 1:17:03| That would be a request, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4623)|
| 1:17:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4624)|
| 1:17:05| Who do you want to start with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| I'd like to start with the Highway Department and then the staff can answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4627)|
| 1:17:12| So the question would be the 150 lot access point as it ties to Beeler Road and all that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4632)|
| 1:17:20| going on with that traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| I'd just like to recap that and then hear from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| Yeah, the traffic impact study that was completed for the subdivision indicated there wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| the need for a left turn lane onto the existing Beeler Farms Road, however, there were some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| improvements identified that needed to be done at Emory Road, at Beeler Road, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4659)|
| 1:17:46| a separate left and right left turn lane, and then I think there was some discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| about improvements along Emory, but that section of Emory is in TDOT's Improve Act project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| It's going through the survey and design process now, so I think the state was willing to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| with the applicant on some options as far as potentially putting in some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4681)|
| 1:18:07| there, but maybe not a left turn lane because there was going to be a five lane in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4687)|
| 1:18:13| And then the number of lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| The number of lots on to, I guess, clarify the question, Commissioner, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| To go through the existing subdivision back to where the new proposed subdivision would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| There was some conversation in here about the total number of lots?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| The total number of lots, assuming only one entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4710)|
| 1:18:33| Yeah, obviously our policy, it's not necessarily written in the subregs, but we do like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| see a secondary entrance at 150 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| I think this would obviously exceed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| We would typically ask for a median section there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4724)|
| 1:18:47| Obviously this is an existing street, so it wouldn't be very practical to install that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| So there was a concern with that, and we did look at it, but there really isn't a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4731)|
| 1:18:57| good viable way to correct that problem with the existing roadway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| Vice Chair, did you want to hear from staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| No, I think that probably covers it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4752)|
| 1:19:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4753)|
| 1:19:14| Opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4754)|
| 1:19:15| Good afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4755)|
| 1:19:16| Kevin Stephens, Carolyn Montgomery & Finley, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4756)|
| 1:19:20| I represent the Beeler Farms Homeowners Association in opposition to this concept plan, and many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| of the client representatives are obviously here, as you saw earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| Beeler Farms is a quiet 53-home subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| It's a single cul-de-sac lane, and this proposed concept plan is attempting to run a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| entrance road for another 126 homes directly through the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4779)|
| 1:19:45| Importantly, the primary road entrance would run directly through the designated common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| property and also through a platted residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| I submit that the proposal should be denied for a number of reasons, but from a legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4795)|
| 1:20:02| perspective, because it would first result in a wrongful taking of Beeler Farms' common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4802)|
| 1:20:07| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Secondarily, it would constitute an impermissible use of a platted residential lot, and third,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| would interfere with the stormwater facilities plan previously required by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4814)|
| 1:20:19| Before I go further, I want to make clear that I strongly agree with the staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4824)|
| 1:20:25| The staff properly found that it was a single cul-de-sac lane that was never intended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| be an entrance for any other subdivision or future development, and the staff properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| cited Section 3.04C2B of the subdivision regulations, which require any future street connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4836)|
| 1:20:44| to identify impact from those connections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| And I submit that all of my clients, the 53 property owners, would strongly agree that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| they would be adversely impacted by this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| It eliminates a common property buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4858)|
| 1:21:02| It interferes with stormwater in a common area detention facility that was designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| on the plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| And from a practical standpoint, it's running a main thoroughfare through a closed cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| and directly through the front yards of some of the existing homes in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4874)|
| 1:21:19| I did want to point out on the recorded subdivision plat, which was the only plat of record when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4879)|
| 1:21:27| my clients purchased their homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| This was recorded in September of 2021, and you'll see again it's a single cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| lane, and it was intended to have homes around that closed cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4895)|
| 1:21:41| Now the only entrance at the end of the cul-de-sac was for two purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4901)|
| 1:21:45| The first purpose, to the north end, was a common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| It's a large common area buffer, and as part of the front of that common area, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| a required detention easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| And with stormwater facilities that were located there, it also crosses the center line of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4916)|
| 1:22:00| a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| Now at the bottom here is Lot 28, which is a residential lot, and there was supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| to be a small access strip for use for that residential lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| So what this proposed subdivision plan now is to take that common area access strip and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4931)|
| 1:22:18| turn that into a roadway for an adjacent development of another 126 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4938)|
| 1:22:23| I think it's important to note that there is no reference on the plat to any opening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4943)|
| 1:22:30| of this cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| There was no reference to future development area or reserve development area, and so certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4952)|
| 1:22:36| my clients had no reason to believe that what was depicted as a closed cul-de-sac would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| be opened and used as a primary thoroughfare for another 126 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| The owner-applicant entity merely owns one plotted residential lot at the very back of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| The owner-entity was the former developer of Beeler Farms and sold out to a new developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| And it's important to note, when they sold out, they sold all the remaining lots, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4980)|
| 1:23:05| for that one lot in the back corner behind the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4985)|
| 1:23:10| It's also important that they sold and transferred the declarant rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4990)|
| 1:23:14| So they have no additional right beyond any other property owner in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| They are a single lot owner, just like all these people are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=4999)|
| 1:23:24| And we submit that there was nothing on the plot or the plan or any other development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5004)|
| 1:23:30| information which would have led my clients to believe or ever understand that their closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5010)|
| 1:23:35| cul-de-sac could possibly be opened to create a main thoroughfare for adjacent development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| I want to make clear that they're not objecting to development of this adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5021)|
| 1:23:47| They're just objecting to the manner in which the entrance is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5027)|
| 1:23:51| This development site is not landlocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5031)|
| 1:23:53| There is clear access from Fairview Road, and there's direct road frontage there, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5033)|
| 1:23:59| would be a possible access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5039)|
| 1:24:01| There's also an adjacent subdivision to the south, which has not been developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5041)|
| 1:24:07| It's been approved, but not yet constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5047)|
| 1:24:10| That could be another potential access point, which we're referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5050)|
| 1:24:13| And you can see that up on the map there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| So, you know, I think it's clear that there are other viable alternatives to develop this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5057)|
| 1:24:24| The traffic study made clear that there was access on Fairview Road, and the traffic engineer merely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| stated that taking that access might be cost prohibitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5071)|
| 1:24:35| But I'd submit that that's not my client's concern and should not be their issue and have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5075)|
| 1:24:42| They certainly shouldn't have their property values harmed when there are other reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5082)|
| 1:24:47| alternatives for access and development of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| Aside from what I've mentioned, there are clearly potential legal challenges to this in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5091)|
| 1:24:57| and I just want to head that off before we have to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| Obviously, using a platted residential lot for a roadway would constitute an impermissible use of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5100)|
| 1:25:08| Secondarily, taking common property from an association that was to be conveyed to that association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| would be an improper taking of the common property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| So I think, in short, if this plan was approved, there would be multiple challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5117)|
| 1:25:24| from a legal and substantive standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| But I think from just a general standpoint, it's clear that there are violations of the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5126)|
| 1:25:35| There are violations of recorded covenants, recorded plat, that would all be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5135)|
| 1:25:41| So that's the objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5141)|
| 1:25:42| Thank you, Mr. Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| As you all know, and I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| I haven't had a chance to be here in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5152)|
| 1:25:53| I've been doing this a long time, and probably 140-plus subdivisions here in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| to my knowledge, I've never had staff denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| And this one was very surprising, because every subdivision we develop, we hear the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5161)|
| 1:26:07| connectivity, connectivity, connectivity, connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| We hear it all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| We're required, in most cases, to provide stub-out roads to adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| In many cases, losing a $50,000 to $60,000 lot at our expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| because staff wants, quote, connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| Biller Farms Lane is a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| It's a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5189)|
| 1:26:31| We have rights to come off existing county platted roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| The common property that the gentleman's referring to is still owned by the original developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5196)|
| 1:26:41| which was Danny Kirby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5201)|
| 1:26:43| They own both 50-foot strips down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5203)|
| 1:26:46| both what you see on the very back portion of the property adjacent to the fielding property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5206)|
| 1:26:52| In addition, that 50-foot strip was recommended by staff for, quote, connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5212)|
| 1:27:02| And I'll read to you what, and you all have this in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5222)|
| 1:27:06| This right here, in the staff report in May of 2020, or April of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5226)|
| 1:27:14| staff is recommending a stub-out street connection to at least one of the larger tracks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| located to the south or east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| This is the property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5243)|
| 1:27:26| So when Mr. Kirby developed the property, he left a 50-foot access there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5246)|
| 1:27:32| to connect over to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5252)|
| 1:27:37| In addition, where the blue lime stream is there, he built that to county specifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5257)|
| 1:27:44| If you look at the pictures that I provided,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5264)|
| 1:27:49| you can see the access road coming between the two houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| the 50 feet, which is acquired by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| Then you can see the culverts that are built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| They spent probably $70,000 putting in county-specific engineered culverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| to create access to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| And I ain't real smart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5290)|
| 1:28:11| You all have been around me a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| But if I'm putting in one house back there on the piece of property he's referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5293)|
| 1:28:19| I don't think I'd spend $70,000 putting in county-engineered culverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| and building that road to county specifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| if my intent was not to extend that over to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| So it's clear that the county staff requested a stove-out road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5311)|
| 1:28:38| The developer provided 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5318)|
| 1:28:41| In addition, has already built and constructed per engineer plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5321)|
| 1:28:47| the culvert and the road crossing over the blue lime stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| to connect to that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5331)|
| 1:28:53| There's no other reason why they would have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| And the property that Jim is referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| the common property back there on the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| is still owned by Mr. Kirby, and that is who we are buying it from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5340)|
| 1:29:04| That property, as well as the adjacent piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5344)|
| 1:29:07| which gives us the entire 50 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| of which we will provide, as per the county regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| access to the detention area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5355)|
| 1:29:17| The detention area is not changing, contrary to what the gentleman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5357)|
| 1:29:22| In all due respect, the engineering is not changing on the detention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| That road, if you look at the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| that road's already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| It's already built. It's already developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5370)|
| 1:29:33| It's already graveled. It's already to county specs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5373)|
| 1:29:37| Well, I apologize. I misspoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5377)|
| 1:29:41| It is a gravel road that's already built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| and the culverts are already there to connect to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5384)|
| 1:29:48| And this was a little bit, I understand this was a little bit unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| but precedent has been set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| if you look at Grassy Creek out in Hardin Valley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| where Knox County approved and staff recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| the extension of an existing subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| through a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5403)|
| 1:30:05| that had already been platted, already been recorded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| but in this particular case, at Grassy Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5408)|
| 1:30:11| there was no 50-foot access already dedicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5411)|
| 1:30:15| They took an existing lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| took the lot out and put a 50-foot road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5418)|
| 1:30:21| through the middle of the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| Mr. Reynolds, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| You are correct, and I'll explain a little bit further in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| Okay, but it was an existing, already established subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| with houses under construction and or built and people living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| And at the very back end of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Knox County, with staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| approved the extension of the road through the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| without an already platted lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| So to suggest that that cannot be done is incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| There's no legal authority that you have to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| All you have to have is 50 feet for the connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| So in all due respect to staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| which I get along with staff very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5462)|
| 1:31:05| I get along with county engineering very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5465)|
| 1:31:08| I have a lot of respect for all these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| but in this particular case, it far exceeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Garden Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5474)|
| 1:31:17| This has a 50-foot access already platted and recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5477)|
| 1:31:20| All we're trying to do is what staff recommended originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5480)|
| 1:31:23| is to provide connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5483)|
| 1:31:26| through the 50-foot access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5486)|
| 1:31:29| that staff originally recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5489)|
| 1:31:32| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| Anything else I can do for you all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| All right, let's take it to commission here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| First thing I want to ask about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| is the loss of the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Like, sorry, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| opposition legal counsel there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| held up the plat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| and so just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| reiterate, make sure I've got it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| all of the persons in the 53?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5525)|
| 1:32:08| 53 home subject, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5528)|
| 1:32:11| Have purchased those homes believing that they were going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5531)|
| 1:32:14| a common area that is now gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| It would be gone if the road runs right through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| If you look at the top of the plat, it's a common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| designated Common Area 1, and that access strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| is to get to the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| That's the only reasonable use of that access area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| and then adjacent to what's Common Area 1, you'll see the easement area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| the drainage detention easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5555)|
| 1:32:38| So this is common area. This is not something that can be freely conveyed to anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5558)|
| 1:32:41| This was dedicated by plat and the restrictive covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| All of the property owners, all of the 53 property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| have a right and use of enjoyment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| in that common property, and it cannot be freely dedicated to anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5573)|
| 1:32:56| one of my, speaking to the commission now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| this is one of my concerns, first concern I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| with this case that there's been a loss of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| common space that was something that was promised to the persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| in this community. I am, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| on record very much for connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| I'm also for common spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| and it seems like something has gone awry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| because this has been taken away from the persons that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| purchased their homes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| For clarification, the common area is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| That will remain common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5610)|
| 1:33:33| All we're going to be doing is providing paved road access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| and frontage to the common area for use and benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| of the property owners. That common area is not going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| It stays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| All we're doing is coming across to the adjoining property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| and that common area stays where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5628)|
| 1:33:51| We're not changing it. We're going to keep that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| We're actually going to dedicate it to the property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| with the previous developer. The previous developer still owns it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5637)|
| 1:34:00| of which we are purchasing, and then it would become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| platted common area for the benefit and use of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| It is not going away. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5646)|
| 1:34:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| Was the connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5656)|
| 1:34:19| originally dated there when the other lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| was made? Yeah, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| Was it always there when the first 53 homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| If you look at the concept plan that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5668)|
| 1:34:31| in 2001, you have this in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5671)|
| 1:34:34| That's the concept plan that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5674)|
| 1:34:37| It shows the 50-foot right-of-way going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| Then it also shows the culverts that you have a picture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| connecting across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5683)|
| 1:34:46| and then that line continues on all the way to the adjacent property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| Why would they put that on the concept plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| Why would they have done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5692)|
| 1:34:55| Showing the culverts, showing 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| If you're just going to provide simple access to a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| or to a common area or to the drainage, that's 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| You wouldn't need 50 feet to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| There was obviously intent when this was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5707)|
| 1:35:10| per staff's request to provide the 50-feet connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5710)|
| 1:35:13| but also they actually developed it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| and put in all the infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| at a very high price across the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| with anticipation of someday connecting over to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| Let me hear from opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| on that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| Where are you coming from there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| Because obviously we're looking at something here that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5734)|
| 1:35:37| connectivity was already sent through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| and the common area is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| There's a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| One of the things that developers rely on when they purchase their home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| is the recorded subdivision plot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Whatever may have been discussed of record prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| they would not be on constructive notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5755)|
| 1:35:58| of having any knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| When you look at the plot that they purchased subject to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| there is no reference whatsoever to connectivity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| to future development, to reserve property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| to anything that would have put them on constructive notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5770)|
| 1:36:13| The 50-foot right-of-way was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| Right, and it was an access to the common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5776)|
| 1:36:19| and what would appear to be a driveway to the last lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5779)|
| 1:36:22| There's nothing on that plot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| that would have put my clients on constructive notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| of any future development in opening up a closed cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5788)|
| 1:36:31| for a thoroughfare for another 126 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| And with respect to the common area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5794)|
| 1:36:37| it will be altered by putting a road through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5797)|
| 1:36:40| It's supposed to be a buffer property and a detention area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| and putting a paved roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| directly through that is clearly going to alter the common property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5809)|
| 1:36:52| When was the grading done for the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| All of that was done simultaneously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| to the development of the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5818)|
| 1:37:01| With the original subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| That's correct, yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| That is not set up for detention. That's incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| You would not have detention coming across an existing blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| So the common area was never intended for detention purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5833)|
| 1:37:16| It was never designed for detention purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5836)|
| 1:37:19| So that was a false and incorrect statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| The detention area is behind lot 27 and it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| It's already in place. It is not changing or moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5845)|
| 1:37:28| That's all designed for the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5848)|
| 1:37:31| This extension road was designed and built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| during the development of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5854)|
| 1:37:37| and has been there ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5857)|
| 1:37:40| Bear with me just a bit here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| I'd like to go to Mr. Reynolds while all this information is fresh on our minds here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| Mr. Reynolds, could you give us a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| background on this road, this 50 foot right of way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| Yes, thank you Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5872)|
| 1:37:55| Just wanted to make two clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| The staff recommendation to create a stub out road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| either to the south or to the east was in our staff comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| to them, which is part of our review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5884)|
| 1:38:07| It's our first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| discussion with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| on technical issues that they need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5896)|
| 1:38:19| It was not a staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5899)|
| 1:38:22| in a staff report to the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| for a condition of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| When revisions are submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| we also ask for a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| response letter. In that comment response letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| they said they did not wish to provide the stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| because of road issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| and potential of losing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| Staff did not pursue that any further as part of a recommendation of approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| going forward. The other is the 50 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5932)|
| 1:38:55| at the end of the cul-de-sac is two fee simple strips of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5935)|
| 1:38:58| It's not a right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5938)|
| 1:39:01| It is two 25 foot strips of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| that create legal frontage for two separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5944)|
| 1:39:07| properties. One is a buildable residential lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| and the other is the common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| So it wasn't plotted as a right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| It does have an easement down the middle of it, which is for access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5956)|
| 1:39:19| purposes, but it is not a 50 foot right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| It's not a 50 foot access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| It's just a typical access easement that you would have going to a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| I may not get everybody in exact order here, but we'll go with Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| Thank you. I've been kind of chomped a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| and the main thing that is bothering me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| is I would like to make a distinction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| or clarification of a specific word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| that keeps getting thrown around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5990)|
| 1:39:53| I think that when this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| and people who are looking at planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| use the word connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| they're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6002)|
| 1:40:05| a symbiotic relationship between two independent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6005)|
| 1:40:08| areas. So connectivity in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| would look like if there was a new neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6011)|
| 1:40:14| there would be a form of access so that you could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6014)|
| 1:40:17| through here, but not a primary access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| So what we're looking at right now, what's been presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| isn't connectivity, it's not a symbiotic relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| of two independent entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| it's more of a parasitic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| of taking something that wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6035)|
| 1:40:38| originally planned for this. So I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| if there is a development back there, connectivity would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6041)|
| 1:40:44| be really great to share a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| to maybe even have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| small road to get through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| just so that the neighbors can get through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| maybe just a walking path, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| connectivity does not look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| attaching to something else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| and taking from its resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| so with that I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| definitely be opposing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| I'm still googling some of those words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| that you threw out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| parasitic may have been a little harsh, but I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| I was going to have to pull out my thesaurus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| there's one in between there that I just couldn't get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| Commissioner Barger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| I just want to point out that when this neighborhood was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| plotted to begin with, the two houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| at the end of the cul-de-sac which appear to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| 27 and I believe 29| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| I'm having trouble reading that because I left my glasses at my office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| are pointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| inward towards the cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| so it's clear to me that the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| was built as a dead end cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6116)|
| 1:41:59| and that the 50 foot wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| driveway easement, right of way, fee simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| was accessed to lot 28| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| that's all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6128)|
| 1:42:11| Thank you. Commissioner Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| Mr. Davis, the question I've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| I'm assuming that you had looked at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| accesses prior to this access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| we have looked at this property now, the feelings are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| great, folks are getting up in age, we have looked at this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| for probably, I don't know Mr. Coons, what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6149)|
| 1:42:32| 10 years, 12 years? How many years have we been working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| on this property? No, when we first looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| before the crash, so it's a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6158)|
| 1:42:41| if you look at Fairview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6161)|
| 1:42:44| their property touches Fairview right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6164)|
| 1:42:47| they don't have 50 feet access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| right there, in addition it's on a blind curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| so if you look at other potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| access points to the property, if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6176)|
| 1:43:00| to the south, there's a huge ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6180)|
| 1:43:03| between there and Rutledge Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| it's not accessible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6186)|
| 1:43:09| across that ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| in addition you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| a pretty significant creek body of water crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| the middle of the property that also helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6198)|
| 1:43:21| prevent access, but the ridge line, where the tree ridge line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| is, that's about 26%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6204)|
| 1:43:27| Knox County max is 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6207)|
| 1:43:30| preferably 12, there's no way to put a road cross there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| and also they don't have any property adjoining there, so their only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| access point is on Fairview, which they don't have 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| in addition it's in a blind curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| so no, they don't have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| to any other portion of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| except what we're proposing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| so yeah, I mean if you were, well you couldn't come out of the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| as you had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| and then even, I don't know about the environmental impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| of trying to cross that creek, I don't know how wide it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| down there, it's a pretty significant body of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| Mike, Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| you had mentioned that you had some information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| on a different, that Mr. Davis had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6252)|
| 1:44:15| in Hardin Valley I believe there was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| subdivision that came off of a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| yes, the name of the subdivision is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| Connors Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6264)|
| 1:44:27| it was developed in, originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| concept plan approved in 94| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| I believe, had a cul-de-sac in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6273)|
| 1:44:36| the roads were installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| so on, houses started constructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| there was one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| additional concepts in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6285)|
| 1:44:48| 1994 and 1996 when the final concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| was approved to extend that subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| from what I could see, what happened is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6294)|
| 1:44:57| both parts of that subdivision were constructed by the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6297)|
| 1:45:00| developer, by the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| the second phase was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| and they hadn't constructed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6306)|
| 1:45:09| houses back in that last portion of the cul-de-sac yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| the cul-de-sac was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| it's not quite like this cul-de-sac where it's kind of perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| centered in the cul-de-sac, that one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| offset so when you're looking straight down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| you kind of see straight ahead, the cul-de-sac was off to your right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| so when they extended the road it just kind of went straight down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6327)|
| 1:45:30| continued straight without there being a bulb on the left side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| it was only on the right, anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| withheld the construction of the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| the lot that was most impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6342)|
| 1:45:45| by that improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6345)|
| 1:45:48| and it looked like that was probably the last lot built in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6348)|
| 1:45:51| with the house facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| the extension of the road versus the cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| so there was obviously some forethought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| even though they didn't plan to extend it initially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| they got it early enough that it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6363)|
| 1:46:06| impact the placement of houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| the cul-de-sac and so on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6369)|
| 1:46:12| and clearly this isn't ideal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6372)|
| 1:46:15| but I think in a way they're almost forced to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6375)|
| 1:46:18| I think Mr. Stevens had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| that, almost alluding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| it's not landlocked, is what I think he was referring to earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| because there are other accesses to it, it does barely touch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| one of the other roads, but from a feasibility access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| I don't know that there's any other feasible way to get into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| the only other thing I struggle with from a legality perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| Mike, you mentioned that it's 25 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| owned, these are by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6405)|
| 1:46:48| if you have a landowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| they have it under contract, they don't own it yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| but obviously they have it under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| but if you've got an owner that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| 50 feet of road frontage on a county road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6420)|
| 1:47:04| that's just something to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| as challenging as it is for the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| it's county road and owned 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| just making that comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| if this was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6436)|
| 1:47:19| being considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| they probably should have done it earlier on in the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| of the subdivision instead of waiting as long as they did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| when the houses were completed, especially around the cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| they're now not directed properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| and it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| unusual to put it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6457)|
| 1:47:40| Commissioner Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6460)|
| 1:47:43| I have actually the same question for Mike Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| that John had, but I thought about another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6466)|
| 1:47:49| though, I've never developed a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6469)|
| 1:47:52| before, but back to the culverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6472)|
| 1:47:55| why were those required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| Why would the culverts have been required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6478)|
| 1:48:01| Mr. Reynolds, do you want to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6481)|
| 1:48:04| The culverts aren't a requirement of the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| necessarily, it's only a requirement for access to the lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6487)|
| 1:48:10| so why they installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6490)|
| 1:48:13| as much as they did might be a good question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| but it was only required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| to provide access for a single family house lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6499)|
| 1:48:22| and a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6502)|
| 1:48:25| depending on what kind of amenities they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6505)|
| 1:48:28| if it's just left as open space, obviously you don't need much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| but if it's an active use of some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6511)|
| 1:48:34| if the neighborhood decided to put in a pool structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6514)|
| 1:48:37| maybe you might need more of an improved driveway system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6517)|
| 1:48:40| I'm not sure what that looks like from a creek crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6520)|
| 1:48:43| standpoint, I'm not in the permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| but normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6526)|
| 1:48:49| you wouldn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| as Mr. Davis said, $70,000 worth of culverts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6532)|
| 1:48:55| to go to another lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| I'd defer to county engineering if they have an idea of what would normally be required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6538)|
| 1:49:01| Yeah, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6541)|
| 1:49:04| two 48 inch concrete pipes there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6544)|
| 1:49:07| don't have the drainage calculations in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6547)|
| 1:49:10| but for a single family residential driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6550)|
| 1:49:13| I think we would require those to convey a 25 year storm without being overtopped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| and due to the bypass water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6556)|
| 1:49:19| whether it was a road or a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| we would have required concrete pipe because our ordinance requires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6562)|
| 1:49:25| bypass water to have concrete pipe versus plastic pipe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6565)|
| 1:49:31| Is there a difference in the width of that crossing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6571)|
| 1:49:34| for a driveway versus a public road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6574)|
| 1:49:37| There would have been, yes sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6577)|
| 1:49:43| Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| Thank you Mr. Chairman, a couple things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| I'm struggling with the 50 foot right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6591)|
| 1:49:54| and the larger culverts that are required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| it seems to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| there was some intent to provide connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| to the property then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| and having said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| I don't necessarily think the homeowners may not have been aware of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6609)|
| 1:50:12| but certainly when we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6612)|
| 1:50:15| analyzing this I think it looks to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6615)|
| 1:50:18| engineering and at that time we may have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| aware of it here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| and maybe the developer even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| Mr. Davis, my question for you is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| there's a pretty good sized lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6630)|
| 1:50:33| next to Bigler Farms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6633)|
| 1:50:36| have you given any thought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| maybe acquiring that and making this part of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6639)|
| 1:50:43| That piece of property was approved, the concept was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| what, two months ago I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6646)|
| 1:50:49| Yeah, it was in the summertime, I can't remember the date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| So that's already gone through zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6652)|
| 1:50:55| gone through concept plan approval and did not require a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6655)|
| 1:50:58| at the end of the road and doesn't have a stub out at the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| connecting to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6661)|
| 1:51:04| It wasn't requested, wasn't required, wasn't recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6664)|
| 1:51:07| and I know in no due respect to Mr. Reynolds but when we get the staff report back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| or the memo and it says staff is recommending X, Y, Z| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6670)|
| 1:51:13| we assume that we need to do those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6673)|
| 1:51:16| in order to get staff approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6676)|
| 1:51:19| so to suggest that they just put it down here and it really doesn't mean anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6679)|
| 1:51:22| when we get a staff report back and it tells us what we need to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6682)|
| 1:51:25| to get staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6685)|
| 1:51:28| and if it says staff is recommending a stub out street connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6688)|
| 1:51:31| to at least one of the larger tracks located to the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| or to the east, that's what the developer did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6694)|
| 1:51:37| and he provided 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6697)|
| 1:51:40| and he retained the common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6700)|
| 1:51:43| which he has not transferred to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| there's a reason why he hasn't transferred it yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| there's a reason why he put the 50 feet in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| as opposed to a 20 foot access which would be required by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| with the intent to extend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| and that's why he put the culverts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6718)|
| 1:52:01| that's why the culverts are done to county specs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| all that was done with the intent to extend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6724)|
| 1:52:07| at some point into the adjacent property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6727)|
| 1:52:10| I ended up getting it under contract before he did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| so therefore he's working with us and we're buying these pieces from him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| to provide the access that he was hoping to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| that we got before he was able to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| and if he had gotten the property under contract behind there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6742)|
| 1:52:25| he would be here before you today as the original developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| saying this is what we wanted to do, this was our intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| he took that money and kept 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| normally you wouldn't have 50 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6754)|
| 1:52:37| if you're just providing access for a driveway or common property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| I'm going to make this easier for you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6760)|
| 1:52:43| if this is okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6763)|
| 1:52:46| I'm going to respectfully request a 30 day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| postponement until the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6769)|
| 1:52:52| I don't know if it's 31 days or 29 days or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| let me get with county engineering because I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| some of the infrastructure and some of that is back there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6778)|
| 1:53:01| we need to come back and look and make sure all that was done to county specs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| we can get with engineering, we can maybe get with the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| and come back to you guys with more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| clarification and information so I would respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| today a 30 day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| I've said 30 days before and it wasn't the actual meeting date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| postponement until the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6799)|
| 1:53:22| you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6802)|
| 1:53:25| Scott, I don't know how to hear what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6805)|
| 1:53:28| it's really tough for these homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6808)|
| 1:53:31| because I feel confident they probably had no idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| that this is a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| when they bought their place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| it puts us in a hard spot even though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| I see it was developed that way, I get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6823)|
| 1:53:46| and I completely understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6826)|
| 1:53:49| it gives us all time to back up a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6829)|
| 1:53:52| get more information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6832)|
| 1:53:55| and so if that's amenable to you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6835)|
| 1:53:58| a 30 day postponement to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| I'd like to go to Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| thank you chair, just wanted to point out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6844)|
| 1:54:07| during the public hearing for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6847)|
| 1:54:10| there was a member of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| who expressed the desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6853)|
| 1:54:16| for a stub out and the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6856)|
| 1:54:20| did not want to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| if a stub out was provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6863)|
| 1:54:26| the subdivision regulations would require a sign placed at the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| saying that there will be future connection happening here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6869)|
| 1:54:32| there would be a requirement on the final plat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6872)|
| 1:54:35| that there would be a future connection happening here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6875)|
| 1:54:38| where people have the opportunity to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6878)|
| 1:54:41| the consequences or the potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| that's why that standard is in the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| to give everybody the opportunity to know what might happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| the developer chose not to provide a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| on purpose, evidently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6893)|
| 1:54:56| they wanted to provide for a house lot and a common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6896)|
| 1:54:59| they did not provide for a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6899)|
| 1:55:02| that would have provided notice to people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| and that was required at what point in time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| that's part of the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| so they would have been required to put that note on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6911)|
| 1:55:14| So, Mike, let me ask you a question real quick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| I know I'm kind of out of line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| but I still have a thought going on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6920)|
| 1:55:23| so what's the answer to the access to that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| if it's not through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| and they can't tie into Fairview Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6929)|
| 1:55:32| because there's a curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| so is that effectively saying that property is dead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6935)|
| 1:55:38| They can gain access to their site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6938)|
| 1:55:41| that is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6941)|
| 1:55:44| if they have to be able to provide access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6944)|
| 1:55:47| they literally have to have access to their site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| they cut this piece out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| but what I'm hearing is there is no other access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| they're attempting to create an access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| where there's not today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| there's other opportunities to create access where there's not today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6962)|
| 1:56:05| so I think there's other options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| they're choosing to go through a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| that is just created and constructed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| and there's a subdivision just below that was approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6974)|
| 1:56:17| did not require a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| I do understand that there's a blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6980)|
| 1:56:23| that they would have to cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| the same blue line stream that we're discussing here with their culvert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| which is part of the reason why staff didn't recommend a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| at times because it didn't seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| feasible or logical extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| across the blue line stream at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| wouldn't we be having the same conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7001)|
| 1:56:44| if they had the stub out in the other subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7004)|
| 1:56:47| that subdivision is not constructed yet and still has the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| provide the infrastructure needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| and the design needed as we would expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| so if I'm understanding correctly he didn't recommend a stub out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7016)|
| 1:56:59| because it would have to cross the blue line stream but to get to the other part of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| you would have to cross the blue line stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| you've been here long enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| if we can get a 30 day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7028)|
| 1:57:11| we've got a lot of lights on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| I appreciate your cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| Thank you Chairman Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7037)|
| 1:57:20| in looking at this I think it's no question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| it was never intended to be extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7043)|
| 1:57:26| I'm not seeing any evidence of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| there's no stub out street, there's no right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7049)|
| 1:57:32| going to the property and a stub out street would be a public street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7052)|
| 1:57:35| and there's no right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| there's no public right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| the idea of running 120 some lots through here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| with all the construction for the next 5 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| including the roads and the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| and the deterioration of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| on this property as a taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7073)|
| 1:57:56| I kind of oppose that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| concrete trucks, gravel trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| building materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| all running through a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| that with 53 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| 1 or 2 lots that are not developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7091)|
| 1:58:14| is a little more than extreme| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| Mr. Davis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| you've been before this commission for years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7100)|
| 1:58:24| I asked on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| how did we get to this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7107)|
| 1:58:30| that a subdivision concept plan has been designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7110)|
| 1:58:33| and presented to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| with a street that's going through an existing subdivision like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| and staff indicated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7119)|
| 1:58:42| they never had any conversations with the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| until it was actually submitted to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7128)|
| 1:58:51| I don't feel comfortable impacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| these residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| for your benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| I'm sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7140)|
| 1:59:05| we can do better than this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| and I'll do respect Mr. Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| we've developed probably 10 subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7151)|
| 1:59:14| that were extensions of existing subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7154)|
| 1:59:17| that did not have a stub out and or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7157)|
| 1:59:20| and so all I'm just asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| give me an opportunity to meet with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| give me an opportunity to meet with the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| and if we come back in 30 days and don't have better and more information for you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| then you all can vote that up or down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| I'm just respectfully requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7175)|
| 1:59:38| I've paid a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7178)|
| 1:59:41| I've paid for traffic impact studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| I've paid a whole lot of time and energy out of pocket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| and I realize you've spent a bunch of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7187)|
| 1:59:50| and that's what kind of surprised me that somebody would come in and spend that kind of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| coming through an existing subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7193)|
| 1:59:56| and not have sat down with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7196)|
| 1:59:59| first to get their opinion or recommendation on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| we had a developers meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7205)|
| 2:00:08| Commissioner Phillips was talking about having some kind of pre-submittal meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| where you get with us before you develop the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7211)|
| 2:00:14| Before I go to other lights here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7214)|
| 2:00:17| Commissioner Phillips I'll let you finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7217)|
| 2:00:20| and then I want to go to our council here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| I don't know what a delay would solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7223)|
| 2:00:26| personally I can't vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| to run the roads through this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7229)|
| 2:00:32| I think the whole intent of connectivity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7232)|
| 2:00:35| as Commissioner Higgins pointed out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7235)|
| 2:00:38| is a secondary issue not a primary entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| into a subdivision and the only entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| the idea of having this many lots without two entrances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7244)|
| 2:00:47| so you've got 170 some lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7247)|
| 2:00:52| and do we allow 170 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| to be created with one entrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| Not normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| I'd like to let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| Councilor Blakeney weigh in on this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| I wanted to just address really quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7267)|
| 2:01:10| the process and the bylaws because this does come up time to time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7270)|
| 2:01:13| but not that frequently where there's a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| at least potentially a request for a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7276)|
| 2:01:19| the bylaws indicate that an applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| can upon prior request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7282)|
| 2:01:25| automatically obtain a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7285)|
| 2:01:28| but that prior request has to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| on the Friday before the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7291)|
| 2:01:34| so where we are now is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7294)|
| 2:01:37| I understand that the applicant now has suggested that perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7297)|
| 2:01:40| a postponement might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| the way that that would have to be handled though is by a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| made by the Commission and then a majority vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7306)|
| 2:01:49| so I just wanted to clarify for the record and for the bylaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7309)|
| 2:01:52| that that is not something that the applicant himself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| can initiate at this stage it could have been done previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7315)|
| 2:01:58| but at this stage it would have to be by motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7318)|
| 2:02:01| and majority vote of the Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| Thank you Councilor Blakeney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| Now let's go to Commissioner Schelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| A concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| submission and application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| is different than a rezone application right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7337)|
| 2:02:20| so if we reject it they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7340)|
| 2:02:23| submit a new one, a new concept plan right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7343)|
| 2:02:26| They can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| there would need to be some kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| change to that within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| I don't want to say it's a year but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| say the Commission denied it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| and they came back with basically the same plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| but with a different access point that would be something acceptable to bring back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| or if they modify their plan in some other way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| they could still bring it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7370)|
| 2:02:53| for the Commission because it would be a change of some sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| I know you told me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7376)|
| 2:02:59| I told too much but I am negotiating with the guy next door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7379)|
| 2:03:02| that we can potentially get additional access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7382)|
| 2:03:05| if you can just please give me 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7385)|
| 2:03:08| to see if I can get that worked out, now I may lose my negotiating power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7388)|
| 2:03:11| but just let me try to see if I can work with the adjacent property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7391)|
| 2:03:14| which we are in negotiations with him right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| to try to figure out additional access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| and if we can do that then that solves all of our problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7400)|
| 2:03:23| I don't want to put any of y'all under any pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7403)|
| 2:03:26| give me between now and next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7406)|
| 2:03:29| the chance to try to get that worked out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7409)|
| 2:03:32| if we can get that worked out this becomes moot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7412)|
| 2:03:35| I do not like this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| and would vote to just reject it as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| and have a different access point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7421)|
| 2:03:44| I also want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7424)|
| 2:03:47| kind of step back and think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| how do we get access to this part of the property or that part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| legally you have access to your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| and there is current access on that one road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7436)|
| 2:03:59| you don't legally have a right to be able to cram as many houses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| on every portion of the property that you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7442)|
| 2:04:05| that's not what the legal access right to your property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| so we need to make sure we step back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7448)|
| 2:04:11| and think we don't need to cram everything in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7451)|
| 2:04:14| it could be just a crappy property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7454)|
| 2:04:17| and there is no good access to develop it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7457)|
| 2:04:20| it's just a component of how things have been subdivided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7460)|
| 2:04:23| different access is what I think needs to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7463)|
| 2:04:26| I think it's pretty clear what we want to change here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7466)|
| 2:04:29| so I'm comfortable making the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7469)|
| 2:04:32| to postpone this until the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7475)|
| 2:04:38| before we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7478)|
| 2:04:41| may I make a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7481)|
| 2:04:44| sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| so we've got a motion on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| to postpone 30 days to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| and we have a second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7493)|
| 2:04:56| the first given by Commissioner Shelso| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7499)|
| 2:05:02| we can continue our discussion here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7502)|
| 2:05:05| so let's go with Vice Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7505)|
| 2:05:08| and then I'll get to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| I think at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7511)|
| 2:05:14| we don't need to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| whether or not we can extend off of a cul-de-sac| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7517)|
| 2:05:20| you obviously can do up to 150 lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7520)|
| 2:05:23| so that road would be built to a county standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| which you can put 150 lots on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7526)|
| 2:05:29| and if you built the first 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| and you developed another 100 off that first 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| then presumably that road would have been built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| to stand up to whatever construction traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7538)|
| 2:05:42| that's not what we're here to debate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7542)|
| 2:05:45| just the one comment I would make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7545)|
| 2:05:48| if we do get this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7548)|
| 2:05:51| I'm going to be very interested to see what those declarant rights are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| on that common area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| if you do have two 25 foot access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| and you have 50 feet of right of way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| that could be on any county road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7563)|
| 2:06:06| that we have out there to get access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7566)|
| 2:06:09| but I do want to see that declarant right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| to make sure that you do have rights to that 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7572)|
| 2:06:15| because if not you're only going to have 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7575)|
| 2:06:18| and it's just not going to work anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7578)|
| 2:06:21| we typically don't get down into civil matters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7581)|
| 2:06:24| but I think because this is a zone plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7584)|
| 2:06:27| I think it's appropriate to talk about those HOA documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7587)|
| 2:06:30| and the covenants and who has declarant controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7590)|
| 2:06:33| and I think that's something we can ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| I don't want to direct staff to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| if we continue this into that December meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7599)|
| 2:06:42| and that's all I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7602)|
| 2:06:45| Commissioner Higgins, thank you for your patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7605)|
| 2:06:48| I'll try to be brief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| I just want to say that if the postponement motion fails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7611)|
| 2:06:54| I'll follow up with a different motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7614)|
| 2:06:57| but I think that we've been a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| there may have been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| over exaggeration as to the hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| when it comes to the access on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7626)|
| 2:07:09| northeast side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7629)|
| 2:07:12| just from measuring on the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7632)|
| 2:07:15| it seems like there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| maybe not a full 50 feet but then also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7638)|
| 2:07:21| there's a driveway next to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| a parcel that is owned by the same owner as this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| I think if there's a contract still at play| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| there may be some opportunities to figure something out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7650)|
| 2:07:33| with that but I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7653)|
| 2:07:36| bottom line I don't think anyone wants to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7656)|
| 2:07:39| the existing cul-de-sac become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7659)|
| 2:07:42| a thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7662)|
| 2:07:45| driveway to an extension like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| so I do think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7668)|
| 2:07:51| I don't think that postponing will help very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| so I think that regardless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7674)|
| 2:07:57| they're going to need to be reworking this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7677)|
| 2:08:00| so I'm not sure if that other than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7680)|
| 2:08:03| make all the neighbors have to come back out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7683)|
| 2:08:06| spend 30 days worrying that they may have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7686)|
| 2:08:09| 100 other residents driving through their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| current road for the next 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7692)|
| 2:08:15| so those are my thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7698)|
| 2:08:21| I concur with Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7701)|
| 2:08:24| there are other opportunities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| while they may require revisioning of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7707)|
| 2:08:30| there are other ways to access that property that don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7710)|
| 2:08:33| require going through a current subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| it just requires someone taking the time to address that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| that's what I would like to see come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7719)|
| 2:08:42| I don't think a postpone is helpful for the exact reasons of having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7722)|
| 2:08:45| all the persons here from the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| come back and I feel like that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| to postpone and it wasn't originated from the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7731)|
| 2:08:54| but it came up through the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7734)|
| 2:08:57| that bothers me that we've gotten all through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7737)|
| 2:09:00| and then we're asking them to come back so I will not be voting in favor of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7740)|
| 2:09:03| Thank you. Okay we have a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7743)|
| 2:09:06| and a second on the floor to postpone to the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7746)|
| 2:09:09| All in favor to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7749)|
| 2:09:12| please say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7752)|
| 2:09:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7755)|

| 2:10:07| Let's take five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| All right let's get restarted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| We're going to move to item 29| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7816)|

| 2:11:16| Legacy Capital Partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| We were here, I believe it was in April| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| for a rezoning and sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| on these three tracts along West Governor John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7885)|
| 2:11:28| You may recall that was a down zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7888)|
| 2:11:31| These were zone CA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| with sector plan of CG or GC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7894)|
| 2:11:37| Ultimately it was a down zoning to plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| up to a maximum density of 18 units per| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| acre and the sector plan was amended to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7903)|
| 2:11:46| MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| With this property, if you're familiar with the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| It is adjacent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7915)|
| 2:11:58| that large commercial node out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7918)|
| 2:12:01| where Chapman and Governor John Sevier intersect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| It backs up to the Lowe's home improvement store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7924)|
| 2:12:07| There is a substantial commercial node there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7927)|
| 2:12:10| We also have an adjacent tract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7930)|
| 2:12:13| that isn't subject necessarily to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7933)|
| 2:12:16| development plan approval because it's in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7936)|
| 2:12:19| That will be part of the development too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7939)|
| 2:12:22| That's zoned by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| It's a commercial zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| The multifamily use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7948)|
| 2:12:31| is permitted there by right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7951)|
| 2:12:34| We submit that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7954)|
| 2:12:37| property is based on location situated perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7957)|
| 2:12:40| for the proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| You not only have the large commercial node with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7963)|

| 2:12:49| There's also a CAT bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| This development will be providing a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| connection to that CAT bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7975)|

| 2:13:04| It's actually a large berm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7984)|
| 2:13:07| I don't know if it was created by construction of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| but it's of substantial height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7990)|
| 2:13:13| That's going to offer natural screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7993)|
| 2:13:16| and buffering of the actual multifamily development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| It will be on the backside of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=7999)|
| 2:13:22| There are very few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| single family residential lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8005)|
| 2:13:28| within the immediate vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8008)|
| 2:13:31| I think there are three houses to the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8011)|
| 2:13:34| There's a good bit of distance between there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| but there's also going to be as part of the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| a substantial landscape buffer created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8020)|
| 2:13:43| Now this development will adhere to the Governor John Sevier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8023)|

| 2:13:53| There will be the vegetated buffer there as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| We're going to try to preserve as many trees as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8036)|
| 2:13:59| but anything that is removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| We'll have a tree survey done and it gets replaced at a 1 to 1 ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8042)|
| 2:14:05| The development plan is in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8045)|
| 2:14:08| with the general purpose and intent of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8048)|

| 2:14:20| boundary which as you're aware encourages compact developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8060)|
| 2:14:23| as well as a wide range of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8063)|
| 2:14:26| housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8066)|
| 2:14:29| Studies show that there is a demand for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| development in this area. We spent time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| through the rezoning process meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8075)|
| 2:14:38| community association as well as Commissioner Daley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8078)|
| 2:14:41| showing them and going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8081)|
| 2:14:44| our proposed development, what was going to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8084)|
| 2:14:47| What type of density and amenities that this would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| and the benefits that it would offer. These would be market rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8090)|
| 2:14:53| apartments. So that being said we ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8093)|
| 2:14:56| request that you follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8096)|

| 2:15:17| I own 401 West Marine Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8117)|
| 2:15:20| The way the development was presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8120)|
| 2:15:23| was it was going to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| They did let us know that but it was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8126)|
| 2:15:29| clarified at the time of rezoning where we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8129)|
| 2:15:32| attended that meeting that it wouldn't have been residential homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8132)|
| 2:15:35| That it would have been an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8135)|
| 2:15:38| The way the land lies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| If you zoom in on my house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8141)|
| 2:15:44| All of that behind this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| is a slope. My house slopes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| I set up but from my house level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8150)|
| 2:15:53| to my backyard that is leveled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8153)|
| 2:15:56| It is a 60 foot drop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8156)|
| 2:15:59| They have done nothing to address the water table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8159)|

| 2:16:14| significant backups during the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8174)|

| 2:16:23| When they originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| got the request it was requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8186)|

| 2:16:35| reduced to 253 by the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| I understand it is looking at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8198)|
| 2:16:41| development in the traffic but I don't think it is taking into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8201)|
| 2:16:44| the retirement community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8204)|
| 2:16:47| they are putting in down the road from this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| It will be pretty much on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8210)|
| 2:16:53| the only apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8213)|
| 2:16:56| except for one that is 3 miles away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8216)|
| 2:16:59| that is only 16 units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8219)|
| 2:17:02| It is not really designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8222)|
| 2:17:05| to hold that traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8225)|
| 2:17:08| They even put right at the Weigels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| You will see in the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8231)|
| 2:17:14| They direct traffic one way for that reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8234)|
| 2:17:17| You can call it an entrance to Weigels or an exit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8237)|
| 2:17:20| You can go in and make a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8240)|

| 2:17:39| increased traffic accidents and issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8259)|
| 2:17:42| because we have a lot of illegal turns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8262)|

| 2:18:06| The two other properties have horses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| We are talking about increased traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8289)|

| 2:18:30| I was not home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8310)|
| 2:18:33| They put stakes in my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| They trespassed to do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8316)|
| 2:18:39| They never requested it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| One of my neighbors works out of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8322)|

| 2:18:57| We are worried about the water table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| There is a dry creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8340)|
| 2:19:03| I have tiles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8343)|
| 2:19:06| It runs under my back property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| It will increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8349)|
| 2:19:12| when they build up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| They will increase the amount of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| If you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8358)|
| 2:19:21| the actual county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8361)|
| 2:19:24| the city backs up to my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| That is where the sewer line runs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| Right in front of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8370)|
| 2:19:33| that is the dry creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| When it rains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| it takes on a substantial amount of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8379)|
| 2:19:42| We are talking about flooding my property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8382)|

| 2:19:54| I have had an inch of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| It is usually an inch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8397)|
| 2:20:00| They put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| some kind of retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| It will overflow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8406)|
| 2:20:09| They designed it right on my property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8409)|
| 2:20:12| That is what I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221110?start=8412)|
