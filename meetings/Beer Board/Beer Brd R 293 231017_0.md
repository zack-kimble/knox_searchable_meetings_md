| 0:17:45| and, you know, get out of the house, get off their phones and all that good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Well, thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1070)|
| 0:17:51| Officer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| We need inspections, fire and health approvals, sales tax registration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1074)|
| 0:17:59| the LLC articles of organization, and then surrender of the existing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1079)|
| 0:18:04| Move to approve pending file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1089)|
| 0:18:10| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Just one comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| I was there last week and could have used a beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| There was 15 kids in our little birthday party for a friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| and it was a great time, so good luck to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1115)|
| 0:18:36| Now you've got your beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1118)|
| 0:18:39| Moving on to addendum items 6A, fan base 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| Mr. Byrd, I understand he called and had something come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Yeah, something's come up, and he wasn't able to make the meeting today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| but he does still need a few items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| He requested an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| He didn't give me a number on that extension, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| We're ten months in, so I'll leave it up to my colleagues on what they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| would like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| Mr. Byrd, did he so he didn't indicate how much time he needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| but he wasn't able to come tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Yeah, he's emailed me within the past two hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| and something had happened this afternoon that he's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| prohibited him from making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| But in his words, he still needed a few items, which is accurate, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| But, you know, he had asked what his options were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| and I asked him how much time that I would approach for an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| but I didn't hear back from him before coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Well, I'm okay with giving him an extension, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1179)|
| 0:19:42| like the chair said, this has been going on for ten months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| so we're getting close to needing to do another background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| So I'm going to say let's give it to the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| and we'll just have him come in the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| So I've got a motion to extend 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1208)|
| 0:20:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1209)|
| 0:20:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| 6B is LELU, and they have actually picked up their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| Is that correct, Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Next is Lunaverse-Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1220)|
| 0:20:32| Bernadette West, 940 Blackstock Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| So, okay, well, since the last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1237)|
| 0:20:43| we have hired Rick Emmett, who used to work for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1243)|
| 0:20:48| to try to help us facilitate this moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| I actually went personally and met with both Peter Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| and Jim Trente to see if there was anything that could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1256)|
| 0:21:02| to help make this whole thing go a little bit faster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1262)|
| 0:21:07| but they're just backed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| Like six weeks ago, we submitted all the paperwork stuff that they needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| to have for the city that they kept asking for back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| with the architect and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| and we still have not heard anything as far as them looking at the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1281)|
| 0:21:29| that we have submitted to even be able to pull a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| so they can come and do an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1293)|
| 0:21:36| We are, I mean, this spot was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1296)|
| 0:21:41| we're opening it up the exact same thing that it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| an entertainment venue with a bar and a stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| and we haven't really done anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| but just having everything having to be completely withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| And the previous occupant, when he was mad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1316)|
| 0:22:01| the former owner poured concrete down the plumbing drain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| so we had to deal with that with KUB for about three or four months, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| But, I mean, all that has been taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I'm just kind of at the, just waiting on city inspections to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| okay, we can come out there and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| So my understanding is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| so you haven't even pulled a building permit and started that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| Well, we initially, when we first did this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1348)|
| 0:22:33| we were going to have it just all be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1353)|
| 0:22:38| And we did all the things that we could do for the outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| and in the meantime, because that was taking a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| with something to do with the floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1367)|
| 0:22:51| and getting a fence around it, which we ended up doing all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| But, so then in last October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1375)|
| 0:23:01| when the tenants that were inside moved out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| we decided that we were just going to have a permanent venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| not just do temporary ones outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1387)|
| 0:23:12| And this is what's kind of facilitating everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1392)|
| 0:23:17| Because we have to have completely new drawings, which, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| we've opened 26 businesses in Knoxville, Tennessee, since we've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| and I've never had this much trouble to try to get a business open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| I'm just wondering, and then I'll turn it over to my colleagues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| but does it make more sense to get your building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| and move that and come back and apply for the permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| once you're further down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| I don't know how long you anticipate your build-out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| Well, when I met with Peter and Jim six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1427)|
| 0:23:52| they said that they were hiring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| they've hired one person and they were hiring two more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1435)|
| 0:23:58| and just getting them trained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| and they showed me how many kind of applications they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| And every time they send something back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| you end up kind of going to the bottom of the list again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| And because they're so backed up, that kind of set us back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| Now, according to them, they're getting through everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1459)|
| 0:24:24| I haven't talked to them recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| but they said that because of the two people that they were hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| the week after I had met with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| that they should be going through all these processes faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| But like I said, I haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1480)|
| 0:24:43| And once we get that permit, we can get inspected the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| We just need a permit number for them to call it in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| so they could come out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| And everything is, like, ready to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1493)|
| 0:24:55| but it's just a matter of having them come out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| Okay, so we're 18 months, five extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| So, Ms. West, I just want to get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| What I hear you saying is that you all have done the work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| everything that you need to do to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| But when you spoke with Peter Ahrens, he was hiring new people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| he was training new people, and that was six weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| and you've not heard anything back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| So I think what you're telling us is that the city permitting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| and onboarding of someone is what is impeding you from moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| It's just, yeah, I guess just the process of going back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| between what they need and what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| and getting the architects on board and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| Yeah, it's just quagmire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| So I'm going to need a point of clarification here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1558)|
| 0:26:00| because I'm still a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| So if they had called you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| and given you the information that you needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| what would your status be right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1568)|
| 0:26:11| We would call them out and have an inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1571)|
| 0:26:14| and we would be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1574)|
| 0:26:17| As soon as they come in and inspect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1577)|
| 0:26:19| we can go ahead and close up everything that they need to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| and I would hope that once we get that, it would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| well, I mean, I have the people in place to get whatever done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| that needs to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1594)|
| 0:26:36| but I just need them to come out there and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| And I would think that I would be able to do it in a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| but I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| So I want to kind of research this a little bit further as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| So I'm going to recommend, because I have seen us do extensions, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| up to 12 months in the past based on various circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| This is kind of the first time I think I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| that it's really been on the permitting office in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| So I want to look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| So I'm willing to extend 60 days and get with Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1631)|
| 0:27:19| and find out exactly what is going on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| but I would not be apt to extend it any further than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| But let me just get some clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| That's what I'd like to propose, an extension for 60 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| to get some clarity around what you're telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| and to investigate what's going on with permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1654)|
| 0:27:39| Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| Push my button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Ms. West?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| So when you say you need a certificate of occupancy, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1665)|
| 0:27:50| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| Initially all we needed was like fire to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| when we had initially applied for it to be outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| And that kind of trailed into the other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| that we were having with the flood plain and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| And so then we just thought it would be easier just to do it inside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| once that other one moved out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| and we thought it would not be this difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| But because of the process of things changing through the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| needing brand-new drawings and architects and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| that's what's kind of made it be a little bit more involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| So real quickly, once you get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| then you have a permit number to put into the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1715)|
| 0:28:37| to call for the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| What will you be closing up once it gets inspected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| You said you'll be able to close up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Well, because of the plumbing issues that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1725)|
| 0:28:48| we had to dig a trench and replant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| They have to inspect that part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| so that we can go ahead and button all that stuff up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| I mean, once we get that all in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1739)|
| 0:29:03| I mean, at that point, it would be just cosmetic at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| Covering up whatever, sewer lateral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| The sewers and, yeah, where all the plumbing ties in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| to the drain that we ended up having to dig up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| And I'm just curious, and I'll stop my questioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| because we've already got a motion in a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| but who's your architect that did your plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1770)|
| 0:29:31| I know where their office is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1771)|
| 0:29:32| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| It was Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| He was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| I'm drawing a blank right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| We can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| He works with the city all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| And they have a good rapport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| And, you know, Peter, when I talk to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| he's like, I know him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| He does good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1787)|
| 0:29:49| It's just a matter of getting everybody, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| all those ducks in a row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1794)|
| 0:29:55| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1795)|
| 0:29:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| And I do have one more question of clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| So I hear on one side that you're seeking a CO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| in order to open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| but then I'm hearing architectural renderings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| which is there any additional construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| And the last kind of issue that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| is we ended up submitting too much paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| because we had, as what was already existing there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| whatever we had that was already existing in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1827)|
| 0:30:30| we turned that in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1830)|
| 0:30:31| and they told us that we put in too much information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| so we had to take pages out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| which put us another six weeks behind on the list of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1835)|
| 0:30:39| you know, all the people that they have to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Because every time when you resubmit everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| you kind of get dropped down to the bottom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| because they say, well, you have too much paperwork in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| We had as-built drawings in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| and they said that was too much information for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| They didn't want to look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1855)|
| 0:30:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1857)|
| 0:30:59| All right, a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| I just might bring to your attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| that providing it passes at council tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1863)|
| 0:31:06| we'll be moving the beer board meeting to earlier in December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1866)|
| 0:31:09| which would actually be sooner than 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| So I would recommend the motion to be to the December 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1871)|
| 0:31:18| I can amend that to the December 10th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| Or 12th, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| 12th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| All right, what's the date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It's to the 12th, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1892)|
| 0:31:34| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| It's still less than 60 days, so that said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| December 12th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| So I have amended December 12th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| I have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1909)|
| 0:31:50| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Hopefully it will be a great Christmas present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| and I'll finally be able to get open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| 6D is PB and G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| And my understanding, these individuals did have a family emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| and are unable to be here but have requested 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1930)|
| 0:32:14| Is that correct, Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I'll make a motion for a 90-day extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| because they can always pick it up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| I've got a motion for 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| 6E, we have the Humble Hog.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1955)|
| 0:32:42| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| Benjamin Grice, the Humble Hog, is at 312 South Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| number 102 in the Century Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| How are things going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| Much better than last time, I'm happy to report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1973)|
| 0:32:56| and thank you for the last extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| So since last time I was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| we legally terminated the contractor who had not followed the blueprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| to the point that we had to demolish the walls that he had built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| including the brand-new restrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| that there was no way they were going to be ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1995)|
| 0:33:18| So to the naked eye, everything looked fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| but once you actually measured it, it didn't follow the blueprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| So long story short, also during that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| we interviewed several new firms and we selected Pinnell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| and they're a great local construction firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| They've done a fantastic job picking up the pieces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Along with the demolition, they've built the new walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| and everything as fast as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| They've taken great care to follow the blueprints and codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2029)|
| 0:33:53| So I guess I'm saying we made lemonade out of lemons in a big way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| I mean, we lost a lot of money with the transition, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| and the time as well, but we saved it big time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2041)|
| 0:34:06| So I wish we were already open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| I wish I was picking up paperwork instead today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| but the fact of the matter is Pinnell is saying November 3rd they'll be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2051)|
| 0:34:16| Final inspections will begin in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| when the fire marshal comes to inspect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| and we start going through the final, you know, when they measure everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| And this week, equipment's arriving so that we can hook it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| for the initial inspections starting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| So if I can do an extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| I would say that's the fastest way for me to get open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| Even if I have to do a background check, I totally understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2081)|
| 0:34:44| If I can't, I totally understand as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| It's been a journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Okay, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| So you're 30 days out from a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| So Councilmember McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Did I hear you correctly to say that they will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| you anticipate them being completed the 1st of November?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Yes, we just shook hands on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| And actually earlier today I met with KUB as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| to make sure all our ducks were in a row there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| The only thing, water and sewer are completely done now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| Gas, once we have the inspection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2117)|
| 0:35:19| when the stoves and stuff will be in-house by Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| I'm even paying K-Tom to put them together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| so that there's no delay on my part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| They'll have them hooked up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Gas inspection will happen as soon as they call it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| That's already been communicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2135)|
| 0:35:37| The one possible delay might be the electric meter situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Apparently there's a shortage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| KUB said they'll help us any way they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| but it basically falls on the landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| to install what they need to install| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| so that we can have metered utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2154)|
| 0:35:58| We're all speaking openly with each other about that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| so even if we have to pay a little extra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| to run the electricity a little differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| as long as the city okays whatever we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| we're along for the ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| The finish line's in sight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2174)|
| 0:36:16| We're not going to let that derail us at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2176)|
| 0:36:20| I'd be willing to move to extend to the December 12th meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| to see if you guys are hoping a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| I hope we're partying way before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| If not, we're probably going to have to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| Sure, and if we have to start over, we totally get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| And all on my part, we totally jumped the gun| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| applying with Mr. Byrd way too early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| We didn't quite understand the length of time it took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| with the permit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| The construction process we weren't worried about from day one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| because it's an old building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| but our plan was built around that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| We paid great architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| OISK3 did a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Really, the only ball that got dropped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| was on the initial general contractor that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| but now that's behind us as well, so yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| Sorry to hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| It happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| You had to demo some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| but that's the motion that I'd like to put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| that we extend them to at the December 12th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| All right, do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2244)|
| 0:37:26| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| That's awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Thank you guys, and just to throw it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| if any of you are walking around downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2255)|

| 0:37:57| Mr. Byrd, have you heard from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Yes, I actually spoke with the manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| Alfredo Felipe, yesterday, I believe, most recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| and he indicated someone would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| All right, well, we'll finish up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| and give them a couple more minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| Yeehaw Brewing is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Hey there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Charles Ellis, Yeehaw Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| The business address is 745 North Broadway, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2308)|
| 0:38:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| How are things with your business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2313)|
| 0:38:35| The business is extremely busy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2315)|
| 0:38:37| We need more storage space, which is this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| that we're talking about today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| We're still working with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| We just want to make sure everything is above board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| so we're requesting an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Council Member McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2330)|
| 0:38:52| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| Any indication on when you might get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| Surely 60 days would do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| I'm sorry, December 12th would surely do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| Make a motion to extend to December 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2348)|
| 0:39:09| And hopefully you pick it up early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2351)|
| 0:39:12| Yeah, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2352)|
| 0:39:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2353)|
| 0:39:14| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2354)|
| 0:39:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2355)|
| 0:39:16| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2359)|
| 0:39:20| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2361)|
| 0:39:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2362)|
| 0:39:23| And again, I didn't see anybody come in with Tienda La Estrelita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| We're about nine months in on this and had two extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| So Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2374)|
| 0:39:40| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Mr. Thomas Felipe has actually been quite responsible in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| and I understand that he talked to our authorities here yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| I talked to him actually at his business probably four or five weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2393)|
| 0:39:57| and it seemed like everything was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I think we should give him the benefit of the doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| and I'll move to postpone it to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2401)|
| 0:40:04| By that time, I think he actually is business is pretty close to where I live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| so it would be easy for me to go in and see what the problem is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| We have a motion to extend to the November meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2413)|
| 0:40:16| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2416)|
| 0:40:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2417)|
| 0:40:18| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2418)|
| 0:40:19| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| And seeing no further business, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-231017?start=2424)|
