| 0:11:13| All right. All right. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=673)|

| 0:11:39| Do we have anybody here? Mr. Byrd, have you talked to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| Yes. I did get a response from Mr. Moncad, who said he would be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| and sent him a reminder today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=708)|

| 0:12:13| They would like to request a 30-day...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| And he's out of town. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Yes. All right. So they requested a 30-day deferral| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=737)|
| 0:12:22| because the owner or applicant was not able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| I'll make a motion for that 30-day, or to the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| Correct. All right. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=750)|

| 0:12:56| All right. How are things going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| They're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=778)|
| 0:13:03| We're waiting on finishing our certificate of occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=783)|
| 0:13:09| and then doing the fire marshal in the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| Okay. Just out of curiosity, how long do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Well, we are going to submit that for the occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=797)|
| 0:13:22| so it should be four weeks, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=802)|
| 0:13:25| Okay. So a 90-day extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=805)|
| 0:13:29| and then if you finish in time, would be adequate, you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=809)|
| 0:13:33| Yeah. Yes, it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=813)|
| 0:13:36| Okay. Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| My thoughts exactly. I move to stand for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=822)|

| 0:13:46| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=828)|
| 0:13:48| Any opposed? All right. Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=828)|
| 0:13:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=831)|
| 0:13:53| All right. So back to eHotels and Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=833)|
| 0:14:04| Who is not here, and he indicated that he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| Yes, ma'am. Yeah, this was last week when I was last in contact with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| I've not got a response to today's reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| Okay. Well, yes, Vice Mayor Roberto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| Well, obviously, I'm disappointed that they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| There is another beer board meeting going on next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| so it's possible there was some confusion there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I'm going to suggest that we defer this to the September meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=869)|
| 0:14:32| just to give them another chance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| and Mr. Byrd might try to get in touch with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| and let them know about the schedule for this September meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| and that they need to make sure they attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Yes, sir. I will strongly advise that they attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Very good. I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| All right. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=896)|
| 0:14:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| Any opposed? All right. So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=898)|
| 0:15:02| Seeing no further business, then we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230822?start=902)|
