| 0:06:09| Primary election day is Tuesday, May the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| This is not a city election, but a county election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| So I just want to remind everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=374)|

| 0:06:28| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=388)|
| 0:06:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=389)|
| 0:06:30| Some developments in the 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| If folks in the 5th District have seen people stringing wires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| in the neighborhood, you might be surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=397)|
| 0:06:40| Hopefully not too surprised, but that could be broadband.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| And they are eight months ahead of schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| and they are looking to implement the first customer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| service in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| So really excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| It gives people options about their service, possibly cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| possibly faster, depending on your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| You can choose, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| So anyway, really happy to see that being implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| Thanks to AUV for hitting the ground running, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| Say a few words about traffic calming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| Davey Sharp and Haley Howard have engaged people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| in Oakwood, Lincoln Park, all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=443)|
| 0:07:25| actually, but kind of in my purview,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| on traffic calming through input through the neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| and by incorporating a process that we now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| have in place through the Neighborhood and Traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Safety Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| We are looking at about 30-something speed bumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| And this was through proper channels and through input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| by the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| So there was a consensus that that would be a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| and we look forward to that implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=476)|
| 0:08:01| CAP is going through some reevaluation right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| There's a public input process on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| You can, at the main station, you can scan your phone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| and then that will take you into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Or you can go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| It's very important that people engage in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| because they are reevaluating a different type of service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| in some of the routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| So if you are a CAP customer or if you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=506)|
| 0:08:31| inclined to begin riding CAP, please go in and take advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| of the public input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=518)|
| 0:08:42| I wanted to congratulate employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| of Starbucks on Merchant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| They just now successfully unionized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| and they are the first Starbucks in the entire southeast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| to unionize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=535)|
| 0:08:56| So I want to congratulate them, and I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=536)|
| 0:08:59| hope that that leads to better wages and working conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| for those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=543)|
| 0:09:04| And then last, just to underline a bit of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| the mayor said about the wall that heals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| if you haven't had an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| or taken the opportunity to go out and see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| I would urge you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=557)|

| 0:18:28| even on Wednesday mornings after long city council meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| she is up before sunrise daily to exercise before work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| And whereas Chief Thomas is a relentlessly optimistic, genuine, thoughtful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| and generous person who finds something positive in nearly all situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| confirming that with her signature catchphrase, it's all good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| And whereas Chief Eve Thomas has left a lasting impression on the KPD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| the men and women of the department, and all those who know her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1131)|

| 0:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| I guess there are two people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| The first is Kathy Edmondson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Ms. Edmondson, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| I just want to let the council know that our intentions are to sell the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1329)|
| 0:22:15| We have several people that are interested in the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| and so we would like to proceed with that if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1344)|

| 0:22:29| Ms. Taylor, did you want to speak to council as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1349)|
| 0:22:32| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| Council, that concludes public forum on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And then we'll go to Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| It's his district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| I was just going to ask Director Wade if she could come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| and give a brief history of the property and the process thus far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Hi, I'm Becky Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| And really nothing would make us happier than for the owners to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1380)|
| 0:23:07| Eliminating the blight of this property is what our goal is and has been all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| But this has been a long-term problem property for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| There have been numerous complaints from the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| codes violations dating back to 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| The property is tax-delinquent back to 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1405)|
| 0:23:30| And there have been several orders placed on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1410)|
| 0:23:37| It has come before the public officer in January of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1417)|
| 0:23:45| And then it was posted unfit for human habitation in July of 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1425)|
| 0:23:53| And, of course, the complaints continued to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| Some people reached out to our staff, Kathy Ellis, about purchasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| And so we passed along the owner's contacts to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1442)|
| 0:24:07| and nothing really changed other than the property continued to deteriorate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| And so in May of 2021, the property was brought before the Better Building Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| and it was rendered unfit, unsafe, and dangerous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1461)|
| 0:24:29| according to the unfit building ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1469)|
| 0:24:34| After that, we met with the owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1474)|
| 0:24:38| Kathy Ellis met with the owners, talked about what the process was moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| with determination and certification of blight by the Better Building Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| And what would happen was that if the property was not remediated or fixed or repaired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| then we would have the authority to acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| The owners indicated to Ms. Ellis that they would prefer to sell it themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| and that was last June 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| Since that time, nothing's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| The property has not been sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| And so we're asking now for the authority to move forward with acquisition if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| The owners still have the right to sell this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| We would like for them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| That would save us a lot of work and effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| And so we are asking for permission to go ahead and move forward in case an ownership change does not happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1535)|
| 0:25:46| because of the owners' action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you, Director Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I want to thank Ms. Edmondson and Ms. Taylor for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| It sounds like the interest of the residents and the city are aligned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| You all want to sell the property, and I think that would be a good thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| and I'm hopeful that you're able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| I want to thank Ms. Ellis for walking alongside and offering to support as well throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1565)|
| 0:26:11| I'll yield to any questions my peers have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1571)|

| 0:26:30| Could you tell us a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| There was a fair market appraisal done in February of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1595)|

| 0:26:45| I just had a question about the process, because once this agenda item ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| I think you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| Once this agenda item came before us, it was important for me to understand the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| and it wasn't clear to me whether all communication coming from the city was actually reaching the owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1618)|
| 0:27:10| especially in terms of the last year and identifying potential buyers for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1630)|
| 0:27:21| My concern is that if we approve this measure tonight, there's still a lack of clarity of how much time they have to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1641)|
| 0:27:35| If they've been in negotiations with potential buyers over the last several months and are about to wrap that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1655)|
| 0:27:44| is there a motion that we can make tonight that would give them that time to wrap up that sale before the city could take action?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1664)|
| 0:27:53| That's one of my concerns, is if we approve this tonight, the city could take action tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1673)|
| 0:28:00| No, we certainly couldn't take action tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| We will notify KCDC, who acts as our agent, to acquire property to begin the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1683)|
| 0:28:11| and they have to notify the owner of the intent to acquire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1691)|
| 0:28:17| And first of all, we would work on a negotiated sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1697)|
| 0:28:21| So we would reach out, KCDC would reach out to the owners to try to negotiate a sale with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1701)|
| 0:28:28| And if that didn't work, then they have the authority to go through a legal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1708)|
| 0:28:36| and deposit the value of the property in the court at a possessory hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| at which time the city would get possession of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| However, that could be months from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| So it's, you know, we can't take action tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| It's a time, it's a very long-term process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| And if the owners had a buyer, had a contract, and we knew things were proceeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1740)|
| 0:29:06| there was a closing date and all that, we would not proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| I have a few questions for the owner now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| Ms. Edmondson, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1757)|
| 0:29:26| One thing that you mentioned when you spoke was that you have been looking for a buyer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| and think you've identified one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| How far along in the process of selling the house would you say that you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1774)|
| 0:29:39| Where are you at in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Well, we just found out there are certain things on the property that we didn't know that were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1782)|
| 0:29:49| and we just learned of that today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| So, more than likely, I would say within a month, everything should be pretty much on its way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1792)|
| 0:30:02| if not sooner, hopefully sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| But, yes, because we've had several people interested in the house, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1806)|
| 0:30:11| and we just haven't made the decision yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| But I did want to let you know of our intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1815)|
| 0:30:19| We want it done as soon as possible ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| From my perspective, I understand that these can be confusing processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| and I want to give the homeowner every opportunity possible up until the last opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1833)|
| 0:30:45| to manage that property themselves and sell it so that that is a part of their family's legacy and inheritance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1845)|
| 0:30:57| And I just feel very strongly about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| And I don't think that it would be too much of a hardship on the city for us to take the owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1860)|
| 0:31:07| add her word that she has every intention to make the sale of this property a priority over the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1867)|
| 0:31:17| and then this could come back to city council in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| And if there's no progress, then we approve this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1881)|
| 0:31:26| But I really don't see any harm that could come from us giving the homeowner at least an additional month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1886)|
| 0:31:36| That would be my proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| And I can go ahead and make a motion, but I'll yield and let others share their thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1899)|
| 0:31:46| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1906)|
| 0:31:48| Councilmember McKenzie and then Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1911)|
| 0:31:52| Ms. Edmondson, thank you for being here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1912)|
| 0:31:55| Ma'am, Ms. Edmondson, I have a question for you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| Or if you can answer the question as a family member and property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| It was stated that the property taxes have not been paid since 2010 or 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1928)|
| 0:32:15| Are you guys out-of-state owners, or could you help us understand why the property taxes have not been paid in such a long time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| No, we're local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| Hardship, that's all I can tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| We have talked with them back and forth, and we have made payments on the adjoining lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| But we've done, you know, as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| Have you attempted to sell the property prior to the city's interest in purchasing the property, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1962)|
| 0:32:49| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Have you attempted in the past to sell the property prior to it getting to this state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1971)|
| 0:32:58| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| We've made a few attempts, and things didn't work out with the buyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| So we're still, you know, we're still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| But we do have some likely prospects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Thank you, Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| Ms. Edmondson, we have a list here of the public officer meetings and the Better Building Board meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2001)|
| 0:33:29| Did you attend the 2018 and 2021 meetings regarding the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2009)|
| 0:33:40| I was not aware of a 2021 meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| I don't know if that was 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| You've been to public, you've been to meetings about the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| I have been to one, and I believe it was 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I don't, Ms. Ellis, Ms. Wade, I don't think the history goes back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2048)|
| 0:34:12| The first complaints were 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| So you were aware and responding to notices and appeared at 2018 meetings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2059)|
| 0:34:26| That there was a meeting in 2018?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2068)|
| 0:34:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Okay, because you just said you went to the 2018 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2070)|
| 0:34:33| 2008, I thought you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| I misunderstood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2078)|
| 0:34:39| Four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| No, I did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I misunderstood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| I thought you said 08.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| I'll look up the agenda of the minutes from the meetings because they'll record who was there and who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2091)|
| 0:34:52| I don't believe those are in our packet, but they'll notice who was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| So I'll figure that out from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Thank you for your answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| I have a question for Ms. Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| Ms. Wade, we voted on a similar situation in my neighborhood that my neighbors have had asked for constant updates on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2107)|
| 0:35:17| And I can't quite remember, but I believe that vote was somewhere between August and October where the same exact situation where it came to council after 10 years of complaints at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2117)|
| 0:35:31| And I believe our most recent update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| So if I recall correctly, that's about six months ago that we voted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2134)|
| 0:35:39| That hasn't even gone to court for acquisition yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| I think that's important for the public to know and for other council members to know that a vote tonight makes nothing happen tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2145)|
| 0:35:56| I have neighbors who are asking me every two weeks for an update, and I keep telling them that this is a six plus month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2156)|
| 0:36:05| And so nothing happens fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| Ms. Edmondson, I wish you all the best in selling the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2168)|
| 0:36:11| I get texts and e-mails every day with people asking to buy properties, and my neighbors complain about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2171)|
| 0:36:21| We are in such need of housing, and there are so many people trying to buy houses so people have housing to live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2181)|
| 0:36:28| The best thing is for you to sell this property as quickly as possible and get it back into housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2188)|
| 0:36:36| And it will be a much faster process if you sell it, and you'll have plenty of time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| But I think, you know, I'm going to support the hard work that the staff has put into this to move this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2202)|
| 0:36:50| And you have plenty of opportunity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| Thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Thank you, Director Wade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| I just want to be clear that I understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| If we vote on this tonight, this starts the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2222)|
| 0:37:06| However, at any point in time, the owner can sell the property before the city does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2226)|
| 0:37:12| There's nothing that we do tonight that prevents them from continuing to look for a buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2232)|
| 0:37:18| They could sell it to the city, or they could sell it on the open market at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2238)|
| 0:37:24| This just begins the process so that if in six months nothing has happened and no agreement is reached for a sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2244)|
| 0:37:34| then the city could condemn the property based on the fact that it is uninhabitable according to the building board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2264)|
| 0:37:46| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| I appreciate the questions asked by my fellow council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2273)|
| 0:37:59| There are also questions that I had for the department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2279)|
| 0:38:04| You know, what concerns me is that, you know, folks without resources in this city are having a tough time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2284)|
| 0:38:21| I heard discussion tonight about the Greyhound bus stop and how we got folks just standing on the side of the road on Cherry Street at a Marathon gas station with no resources while they're waiting for a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2301)|
| 0:38:35| And this is a private bus company, so government throws their hands up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2315)|
| 0:38:40| But when we have folks in our community with lots of resources, all of a sudden we see members of the city kind of do back flips and not only make sure that they're supported,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2320)|
| 0:38:56| but like the agenda item that we have coming up, that they're able to maximize their profits with whatever they're able to do in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2336)|
| 0:39:07| And I think, you know, during this time when folks are struggling, we can show a little grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2347)|
| 0:39:15| And it is much more difficult to navigate and get all of your affairs in order when you do not have all of the resources in the world and you're just relying on yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2355)|
| 0:39:32| And now you have this threat that's coming, and you don't know if it's going to happen in a month or six months from now or when it's coming, but you know that it's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2372)|
| 0:39:44| What I would hope is that, you know, a month-long postponement to show, you know, our community that we understand that these are hard times, and we may have a hot market right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2384)|
| 0:40:05| but I tell you, it can be a lot for folks with fewer resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2405)|
| 0:40:12| And so I just wish folks, you know, we could have a little bit more understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2412)|
| 0:40:17| There's nothing, nothing that inconveniences us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2417)|
| 0:40:24| I can't even think of one inconvenience that would come from postponing this a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2424)|
| 0:40:32| So these homeowners can walk out of here today knowing that the city is not going to move forward within this next month so that they have time to sell the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2432)|
| 0:40:43| So I would make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| I'll make a motion to postpone it for 30 days, allow the homeowner to move forward with the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| OK, a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Ms. Parker, I'm told by the recorder, it needs to be 28 days to four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| Would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| OK, there's a motion to postpone this for four weeks or 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| Is there a second to the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| A motion fails for lack of a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| Back to the original motion to approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| One more comment to Ms. Edmondson and Ms. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| I know you've had a hardship for a long time with the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| I know it's been really hard to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| The good news is that if we approve this measure, you'll have a certain buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| And I guarantee you, given the housing market we're in right now, you'll have a lot of buyers in between now and the next six to 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| And I'm really sure that this is the best grace we can offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| And I think that as a result, your hardship will be over and you'll be able to sell the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2506)|
| 0:41:52| I appreciate you for the brief neighborhood history lesson before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2512)|

| 0:44:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2664)|
| 0:44:25| It helps if you use your light, then I can see it more easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| But okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Well, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| I went too fast to see your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2670)|
| 0:44:32| We'll back up and take your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| I guess this is for Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| Is that where I'm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| That's where we're on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| Summit Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| And I think you've muted yourself maybe with the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| So I had some questions about this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2691)|
| 0:44:57| I did appreciate that we did get more information about this TIF plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2697)|
| 0:45:04| But I did have a few questions regarding the affordability piece of it, the four workhouse apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2704)|
| 0:45:18| Mr. Hill, if you could state your name and address for the record and then tell us a little bit about the affordability elements of this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| I'm Tim Hill, 311 Southwest Garber Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| This project has four workforce housing units that are rent limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| And in our packet it says limited at 27% of income of the resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2738)|
| 0:45:47| Does that include the HOAC as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| That's probably more appropriate for KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| That was a program that we worked together to incorporate on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2755)|
| 0:46:00| So I'm not entirely sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| Ben Bentley, the head of KCDC, is here and available to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2763)|
| 0:46:09| Mr. Bentley, if you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| So actually the numbers have improved since this was published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| So we think it's going to be more like 27% at 75% AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2774)|
| 0:46:20| So that's ratcheted back a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| But that will be reflective of all of the costs of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| And this is probably not a question for Deputy Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2787)|
| 0:46:36| So I'll give you a heads up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| In terms of the financing, one thing that I was trying to wrap my head around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| is it said the condos could be sold from $200,000 to $800,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2803)|
| 0:46:49| The financing was based on a condo being sold at $337,000, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| The assessment did not take into account whether, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2818)|
| 0:47:07| it only looked at those numbers that were provided for the financial account of the tip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2827)|
| 0:47:16| But what happens in this agreement if those condos sell for $1 million each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2836)|
| 0:47:23| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2843)|
| 0:47:24| So actually I'm also going to ask our great partner at KCDC to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| So as you know, KCDC is our lead redevelopment partner for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| We've been working very closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| We provide policy direction, and then through great leadership from their organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| we work together then to negotiate the agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| So I'm going to let Mr. Bentley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| Yeah, so I think the best way to think about this is twofold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2866)|
| 0:47:49| But obviously the sales would be attached to appraisals and assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2869)|
| 0:47:53| So I think, number one, keep in mind that the payback period will shrink up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2873)|
| 0:47:58| as you see the value of the property go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| Now, another thing to consider when we're doing this evaluation, it is a point-in-time evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| I know you know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| But the thing that I would be concerned about, sales prices may go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| but construction costs are doing all kinds of crazy things, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| So we tried to do some sensitivity analysis on both of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| to look at what can revenue expectations be, if it's bad versus good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2898)|
| 0:48:23| I mean, I hope it's not bad, but I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| And we did the same thing on the cost side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| So this is a conservative estimate on both of those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| trying to take the best knowledge we know right now and put it to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| But you're right, the sales numbers could improve, the construction costs could go up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| and that would obviously impact some return expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| And now once this agreement is set, there's no adjusting those figures down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| based on increased revenue coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| Okay. That's all I have. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| Thank you. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2939)|
| 0:49:00| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I have a question for Deputy Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| We have a third party that reviews TIFs and pilots, and the same party reviews those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| so there's a certain amount of consistency and objectivity built into that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| And I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Conversation that I had with you recently was that it's not straight mathematical formula| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2957)|
| 0:49:24| in terms of what the city supports for pilots or TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2964)|
| 0:49:29| There's policies or preferences or priorities such as housing, workforce housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| that we can choose to support or not support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2975)|
| 0:49:38| And so certain projects get the support of the city at the beginning of that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2978)|
| 0:49:42| whereas others may not if they're not willing to include an affordable housing component of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2987)|
| 0:49:48| Is it fair to assume that this development in the middle of downtown would not have a workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| excuse me, a workforce housing aspect to it without the city's policies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=2994)|
| 0:50:00| I would say that that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| And that may be a good question for Mr. Hill, but he's nodding his head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Okay. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| So naturally it wouldn't make sense in the middle of downtown to have subsidized housing of any sort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3007)|
| 0:50:13| but because of this mechanism we can guarantee it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3019)|
| 0:50:20| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| Yeah, I just wanted to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| It's interesting for those of us who obviously know what this block looks like right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3025)|
| 0:50:31| it's very cuts off parts of the downtown area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| and it's interesting to look at the old KGIS historical maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| and see those buildings that used to be there and Commerce Street that used to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| So I'm excited that KCDC put this out for an RFP and that that process has gone well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3045)|
| 0:50:54| We're in a pretty uncertain market right now with construction supplies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| and moving any projects forward and building things is really tenuous right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| And so we've been talking for a long time about connecting Gay Street and getting that block filled in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| We all know we need more housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| And in reviewing this packet, you know, this is over a $27 million outlay with a very small TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3074)|
| 0:51:23| I believe Mr. Hill will quote me, it's three point some million to leverage and make this project move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3083)|
| 0:51:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3093)|
| 0:51:34| Which that's assuming that materials don't continue to escalate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| Inflation doesn't continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| The rates for borrowing, I thought that the rates in this packet were pretty low, honestly, for the borrowing rates there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3102)|
| 0:51:52| I hope you can get those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| I really do because I'd love to see the project move forward and for that connection to be made there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| So I'm glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| And I know one of the things I asked you was about your response to the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| And I don't know if you want to comment on that and kind of what you were thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| and how it fits into that block and makes that connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| There were three respondents to the RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| These are long, arduous, difficult projects that take a lot of resources on the front end to even put an RFP together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3141)|
| 0:52:32| I would say the prioritized scoring criteria in this particular RFP was how do you lure pedestrians from the 300 block to head northward to the 200 block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3152)|
| 0:52:47| Because all too often, and I see it, they'll get to visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| They'll kind of look over the great divide of Summit Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| And there's this big missing, just kind of a downtown desert there, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| And they turn back around and head back toward down Gay Street or Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| And that's just normal behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| They understood the need to reconnecting the northern part of downtown to the rest of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3188)|
| 0:53:15| And we believe this project and what we proposed will help in that matter tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3195)|
| 0:53:23| We've created curiosity with a lot of outdoor plaza area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3203)|
| 0:53:29| So when you look over there, you're going to see people dining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3209)|
| 0:53:32| And we have a pedestrian thoroughfare that connects Summit Hill to Vine Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3212)|
| 0:53:40| It's somewhat akin to Market Square, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| So, yes, and I would like to respond to the market as far as what happens if these condominiums sell for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3224)|
| 0:53:55| One big benefit is the tip gets paid off more quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| So I would love for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| They tested the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| The third-party reviewer tested the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3245)|
| 0:54:08| They surveyed some local realtors here to verify what the market rate per square foot was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| So we believe that it was a thorough vetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3254)|
| 0:54:18| It lasted almost a year through this third-party procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| So we feel very good about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Hope that you'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| TIFFs and pilots have certainly rebuilt this great downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3266)|
| 0:54:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| One last question, Mr. Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| So the returns that are in the packet I think is important for the public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| The returns that are in the packet are not annual or continual, ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| Without the TIFF, it's 3-point-something, and with the TIFF, it's 11-point-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| That return is at the 20- or 30-year mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| Assuming an asset sale disposal in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| So this project really doesn't make any money until you sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| This is not what you would think of as a cash-on-cash annual return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| like maybe an interest gain on a savings account that you would get annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| That's not it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3314)|
| 0:55:15| They sell the asset 15 years in the future, speculate what that will sell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3315)|
| 0:55:22| and I think he noted in the report that he and I had a difference in what that value would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| It was almost $2 million, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3328)|
| 0:55:30| because he's used historic high-price asset disposal at that 15-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3330)|
| 0:55:37| The third-party reviewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| The third-party reviewer did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| So, yes, they sell the asset 15 years in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3340)|
| 0:55:44| and sprinkle backward a return each year going backward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Councilmember Thomas, and then Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3354)|
| 0:55:57| I think a question for Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| Of course, we're all looking at tax base and the advantages of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3360)|
| 0:56:08| What is the projected tax revenue for this parcel at the maturation of the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3368)|
| 0:56:16| Ms. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| Yes, so that's one of the exciting parts about this project is, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| it's currently a surface parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3381)|
| 0:56:23| so the tax revenue on a surface parking lot is not significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3383)|
| 0:56:29| So we are looking at $185,000 of property taxes annually to the city after redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3389)|
| 0:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| And presently, how much taxes is the city getting from that parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| There is no property tax being collected on this parcel right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| Thank you, Councilmember Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3410)|
| 0:56:51| Councilmember Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| Two other thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| One is we really need the parking study from the still unsigned stadium development agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3416)|
| 0:57:06| We really need to understand what our parking assets are going to be downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3426)|
| 0:57:10| and whether, you know, especially when we're talking about KCDC property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3430)|
| 0:57:16| it's the best and highest use for that space based on our current needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3436)|
| 0:57:24| You know, there's been a big shift since the pandemic hit in terms of what our priorities need to be as a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3444)|
| 0:57:32| and we really need to understand what our parking needs are downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| and what that plan is going to be for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| The other piece that I wanted to mention, and this is just somebody growing up in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| started working downtown in Knoxville when I was 16 years old, worked there for years, here, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3469)|
| 0:57:56| And, you know, when we had, you know, Lord Lindsey's here and then the Underground all the way over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3476)|
| 0:58:03| I remember running all around downtown, and it was those locations that you went to that pulled you to the other side of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3483)|
| 0:58:11| because you were, you know, passing a whole bunch of closed up shops on the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| And so I understand it from a business perspective, having that goal of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3495)|
| 0:58:24| wanting to pull people in based on the design and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| But in terms of a KCDC priority for development for our community, I was struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3508)|
| 0:58:38| I'm struggling with the stadium, I'm struggling with this project of using this idea of connecting different parts of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| as a reason for the public assistance, because I'm just not convinced that that is what's going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3525)|
| 0:58:54| And in some ways it could, like the stadium, create more obstacles than opportunities for folks to enjoy downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3534)|
| 0:59:04| And so I just, you know, in terms of our redevelopment, we've got to shift to a pandemic mindset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| We've got to understand how much suffering there is in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| We've got to understand how much affordable housing we need in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| We've got to understand what adding million-dollar condos does to our housing market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3557)|
| 0:59:23| It's hard for me to be excited about four units out of 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3563)|
| 0:59:31| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| And to be told that we wouldn't usually see this, so we should be grateful for these four units out of 53.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3572)|
| 0:59:40| You know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3580)|
| 0:59:41| I would rather see bigger TIFs and longer TIFs so that we can get the housing needs met in this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3581)|
| 0:59:51| That's all I want to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3591)|
| 0:59:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3594)|
| 0:59:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| I was just going to say I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3597)|
| 1:00:02| I will say I agree with you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| I remember when things were scattered around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| But about 22 years ago, our community launched a strategic planning effort that talked about what the citizens wanted downtown to be like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3607)|
| 1:00:17| And they wanted a vibrant, connected, 24-7, vibrant downtown with housing, shops, restaurants, and the like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3617)|
| 1:00:28| So what the city has been doing in that time is building what the community said it wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| We have benefited from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| I agree with you that there are many, many challenges that the city has to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3638)|
| 1:00:44| However, I believe supporting a project that puts property taxes back on the roll, again, helps us fund our city budget to do the other things that we need to do to help some of our more struggling citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3644)|
| 1:01:03| So I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3663)|
| 1:01:05| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-220419?start=3665)|
