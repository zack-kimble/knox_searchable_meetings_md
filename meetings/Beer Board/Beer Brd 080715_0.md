| 0:00:02| The acting chair would call the beer board to order, today being July 15, 2008, time of 6 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=2)|
| 0:00:12| I want to step away from the agenda very briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=12)|
| 0:00:16| As we all have read in the paper, our colleague is recovering from an accident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=16)|
| 0:00:22| And I would like to ask, since he is the chair of the beer board, if we would stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=22)|
| 0:00:25| and ask Council Member Pillow to kind of issue us a prayer for the Hall family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=25)|
| 0:00:32| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=32)|
| 0:00:34| And please add in there Mr. Swanson's wife and their family for their recent loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=34)|
| 0:00:40| Thank you, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| Our father, it is always a difficult time when our friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=44)|
| 0:00:51| and our colleagues are going through a very difficult experience in their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=51)|
| 0:00:58| And recent days have really brought us to think frequently and prayerfully about Steve Hall after his motorcycle accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=58)|
| 0:01:09| and the tragic events that have occurred to his family in the last few days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=69)|
| 0:01:15| We are so grateful for our relationship with him, our friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=75)|
| 0:01:22| And we pray that you will be with him and that you will support him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=82)|
| 0:01:27| and give him strength and patience to go through the recovery, which may be extensive and painful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=87)|
| 0:01:34| And we just pray your comfort upon Steve and his wife, Janet, and their lovely family during this time when they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=94)|
| 0:01:42| struggling so with decisions they must make and with just seeing the evidence of the accident daily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=102)|
| 0:01:53| We pray that you will also be with Mr. Swanson and especially his wife, Pam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=113)|
| 0:02:01| It has been a very difficult time for their family in losing a family member who means so much to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| Pam, as you know, has lost her wife, her mother, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=129)|
| 0:02:15| And God, we know that it is going to be very difficult for her father as he continues his life without her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=135)|
| 0:02:24| We pray your blessings on Pam and Charles and their entire family and especially on her father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| who needs your comfort in these days of loneliness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=151)|
| 0:02:37| We bring all these things to you because we know that you are always with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| and it is your power that sustains us and that blesses us when we are in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=163)|

| 0:03:26| Once again, I'm already tripped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| Chair would entertain a motion to approve the minutes of the last board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=213)|

| 0:03:35| All in favor, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Those opposed have likewise right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Now, Blue Elephant, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=220)|
| 0:03:44| I've spoken to this every time it has come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=224)|
| 0:03:49| I have heard and I intended to make an inquiry of the individual who had asked me to postpone it initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=229)|
| 0:03:58| I have heard nothing from them, and I really don't know the status of that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| I haven't seen anything to indicate that anything has changed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| And I apologize to the council and to the Bear Board for not making that phone call, but no one contacted me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=250)|
| 0:04:20| So I would just leave it with that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=267)|
| 0:04:31| Change your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| Have you heard anything, Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Yes, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=274)|
| 0:04:35| We've heard from the leasing agent, and we have been told,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=275)|
| 0:04:37| although we don't have anything written, that this business is not going into this space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| We also note for the record that no one has been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| Is that correct, Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=287)|

| 0:04:49| No one's been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| What is the pleasure of the Bear Board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| Mr. Vice Mayor, if there's no motion, it dies for lack of motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=295)|
| 0:04:58| That's correct, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| I believe at this point that's advisable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=300)|
| 0:05:04| Thank you for your patience because the leasing agent is who did ask me to postpone that initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| Seeing no motion, it fails for lack of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=315)|

| 0:05:41| and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=341)|

| 0:06:07| Chairman, there's a note in our packet that this business would like to postpone their appearance until the September meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=367)|

| 0:07:38| R.M.H. Knoxville, LLC, Hooters of Knoxville, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=458)|
| 0:07:48| Keith Trajansky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=468)|
| 0:07:49| Business address is 8050 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=469)|
| 0:07:53| Officer Husky?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=473)|
| 0:07:54| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=474)|
| 0:07:55| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=475)|
| 0:07:56| Waiting on approval from the Fire Inspector, Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| and we need a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=479)|
| 0:08:03| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=483)|
| 0:08:05| Well, I just wanted to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| You know, sometimes I'm just totally amazed at the information that is given with the address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| and the school, the funeral parlor, whatever that is the closest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| And, you know, just in looking at yours, sir, I thought have you ever been there to Hooters on Kingston Pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=500)|
| 0:08:28| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Well, you know, it just amazes me that Weaver Funeral Home would be the closest that you would specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=509)|
| 0:08:35| when Mann's is just a few blocks down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| And then I was looking at Oakmont School on Gleason Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=518)|
| 0:08:41| and I thought Bearden High School is practically next door to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=521)|
| 0:08:44| So I just, you know, it's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| But I really think these things need to be completed explicitly with the information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| because there are reasons that those questions are asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=533)|
| 0:08:56| And I really found your application to be, unfortunately, not extremely explicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=536)|
| 0:09:03| when it came to answering those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=543)|
| 0:09:05| Well, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| I didn't fill out the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| Those were filled out in our home office in Louisville, Kentucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Well, it is in my district, and I will make the motion that it be approved pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=554)|
| 0:09:27| But I would just say to you I'm very disappointed that you're not more familiar with the location in which you're operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=574)|

| 0:17:48| Officer Husky, it's not being for processing nor the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1068)|
| 0:17:53| We'll go through the formalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| Waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Inspector, Health Department, and Task Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| Certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| With the pleasure of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| I move to postpone this applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| until the August meeting of the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| so that Mr. Patel can get in for proper processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Moved and properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| You understand, Mr. Patel, that you're being postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| or the motion is to be postponed to the next beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| meeting so that you can get your documents in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| and get in for processing with the fingerprints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| You understand that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| Actually, sir, the premises is closed premises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| and that's why I have not completed the formalities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| You need to get that completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| We're about to have a vote on this motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| but the motion is for you to get that completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| before we take any further action on your beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1122)|
| 0:18:43| All those in favor of the motion on the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1123)|

| 0:18:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Those opposed, please get in and get your processing done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| and any other paperwork to Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| We'll see you at your next beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Pepito's Mexican Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| And as they come forward, I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| to recognize Attorney Swanson, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| You noted in your packet that in measuring the distances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| it would indicate that it is within 300| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| feet of the Thaxton School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| And I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Well, I would say that the information that I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1161)|
| 0:19:28| is that the beer permit that existed prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| was surrendered on November 5 of 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| and this application was filed in June of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| And so more than six months have passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| and so they don't really qualify as non-conforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| pre-existing under the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| So that's a problem that needs to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| Under your interpretation, what are our options, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1197)|
| 0:20:03| I think their options are, unless this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| is measured incorrectly or there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| some other issue related to it, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1209)|
| 0:20:12| think the options are the same as they were for Shane's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| Rib Shack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| You have to get an ABC permit, a liquor by the drink permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| or you're not eligible for an on-premise permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| Council Member Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| That was my same question, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| interested in hearing what their response to that would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| As far as I know, we don't have enough seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| to get the liquor by the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| Is that 72, I believe, or plus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| I do not know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1240)|
| 0:20:43| 75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| We have 75 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1244)|

| 0:20:54| All right, anything else for the Council Member Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| I'm sorry, Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1259)|
| 0:21:01| No, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| So y'all can't get an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1262)|
| 0:21:06| and we can't issue you a beer permit unless the school moves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1266)|
| 0:21:14| ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| How many seats do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1276)|
| 0:21:18| About 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1279)|
| 0:21:19| You need about 30 seats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1279)|
| 0:21:27| Any further comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1287)|
| 0:21:28| Yes, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| I guess we can either deny this now, or we can postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| and let you try and figure a way around this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| What would y'all's pleasure be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| I'm Mike Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| I'm the property owner, and I'm the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| And we operate the Oak College Inn next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1302)|
| 0:21:48| Is there any option at all on the six month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| Is that a carved in stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| I was reading through the ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| and I saw the 300 feet, but I didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| see where the grandfathering is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| I'm sure that's in some other ordinance not specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| to the beer ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1325)|
| 0:22:07| Actually, it was attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| I thought perhaps you were the ones who attached the ones that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| doesn't apply in the case of a business engaged in selling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| distributing, or manufacturing beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| And at the very end of that section, it's 4-73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| It says, this section shall not apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| if beer is not sold, distributed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1345)|
| 0:22:27| or manufactured at that location during any continuous six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| month period after January 1, 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| So that's the six month gap there that gets you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| That's the provision of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| It's not carved in stone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| It's carved in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1361)|
| 0:22:43| And as long as it's in the code, the beer board members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| are obligated to follow the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1365)|
| 0:22:48| So no recourse to ask for any extension on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| from city council or anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| It's not a distance that can be varied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| if that's what you're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| No, I'm not asking for the distance to be varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| I'm asking for a variance on the grandfathering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| because we're just barely off a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1381)|
| 0:23:03| If we were aware of it, we would have gotten a permit earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1383)|
| 0:23:07| It was not brought to our attention until today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| And I know that's our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| But I just ask for a little bit of leniency in the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| that if we had known, we could have gotten a permit two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Or we could have got the application in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| and that's all that would have mattered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| Boy, I sure wish you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Let me suggest that maybe, I see Ms. Martin's on the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Before I suggest something, yes, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| This is not offered as any kind of advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| but they may be able to provide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| But they might consider looking into getting a wine permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| That's what I was about to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1420)|
| 0:23:41| Because I understand that the ABC considers that a liquor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| by the drink licensing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1424)|
| 0:23:46| I was about to suggest that you may want to consult counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| and explore other options, such as as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| to a straight ABC license for liquor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| maybe a wine license, which the footage requirement is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1433)|
| 0:23:57| as stringent on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1437)|
| 0:23:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1438)|
| 0:23:58| Well, it may be an option for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| but that is not legal advice, and the beer board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| doesn't give legal advice to applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1442)|
| 0:24:04| So at this time, if you would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1444)|
| 0:24:06| for us to postpone it to allow you to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| the chair would entertain such a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Yes, counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1451)|
| 0:24:11| Since that's in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| I just need a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Now you can see it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1455)|
| 0:24:17| Since this is in my district, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| not sure how much time they're going to need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I don't think one month is going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| So I mean, we don't want to string it out too long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| because they want to get their business going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| But it doesn't look like one month is going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| Maybe we should postpone it for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| Any thoughts about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| That works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1479)|
| 0:24:39| We'll make a motion to postpone till the September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1484)|

| 0:27:18| Are you requesting that we give an extension, another extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1638)|
| 0:27:24| to the next regular scheduled beer board meeting in September?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1647)|
| 0:27:27| We should have all the permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1647)|
| 0:27:29| Well, I said August, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1649)|
| 0:27:30| You said one month to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Council Member Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Move that we extend this to all the next regularly scheduled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| beer board meeting in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| Second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| All right, Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| Are you sure you'd be done by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1663)|
| 0:27:45| It's no skin off our nose to delay it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| And you get it when you finish everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| So I'd almost, unless you're sure you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1670)|
| 0:27:52| going to be done in a month, we should extend it longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| He can come back in a month and say he's not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| Well, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| I think, is there how the advocate would like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| I am cautiously optimistic that we can get it done in a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1685)|
| 0:28:05| Then the chair is going to request a cautiously optimistic vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1685)|
| 0:28:09| All those in favor of the motion, please signify by saying aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1689)|

| 0:28:17| is actually you don't have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1697)|

| 0:28:56| But July 30th will be the date we open, which is two Mondays from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1736)|

| 0:29:08| extend to the next scheduled billboard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1748)|

| 0:29:50| So we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1790)|

| 0:30:59| if you get all the unfinished tasks completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1859)|

| 0:31:09| And he only has dial-up internet access, so he can't even watch us online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| But we can provide him with a quality DVD of this proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080715?start=1873)|
