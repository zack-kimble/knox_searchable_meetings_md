| 0:06:59| Karnes Fire Department, Knox County Rescue, and Seymour Volunteer Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=419)|

| 0:07:08| Chair recognizes Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=428)|
| 0:07:11| Commissioner Daley, you pulled this off of consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=434)|
| 0:07:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| It's been an honor to serve on this Fire and Technical Rescue Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| It's been awesome. I think we've done a great work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Mr. Dwight Vanderboot is here. He's going to give us an update on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=446)|
| 0:07:31| We did vet these MOUs out in a meeting last week, I guess it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| I thought we may have fire and rescue here, so I was going to make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| so they wouldn't have to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| I'm going to still go ahead and make a motion to approve because it's all been vetted out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| and Dwight can answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Motion has been made by Commissioner Daley, seconded by Commissioner Jay to approve this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=473)|
| 0:07:59| Mr. Vanderboot, would you like to speak to it before we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I might just very briefly because this will come back before the body in a few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=482)|
| 0:08:08| Dwight Vanderboot, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=488)|
| 0:08:11| These original MOUs and the dollar amounts that you see, like so many things, were affected by COVID this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=491)|
| 0:08:18| And finance, in attempting to allow for the possibility of reduced revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| requested that the amounts be cut slightly in order to just safeguard against anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| that might occur in the course of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Obviously the year has gone better than we thought from a revenue standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=514)|
| 0:08:37| and when these amounts were discussed we made a commitment to the agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=517)|
| 0:08:43| that we would try to make them whole through designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| As it turned out, we now have ARPA money available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=528)|
| 0:08:51| so we're going to come back in a few months with small MOUs that will feature ARPA money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| that will raise the agencies back to where they were in the prior fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| Each agency was cut 18.5%, so we'll come back to this body with a separate set, again, of MOUs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| and those will be ARPA funds, but we don't need to and can't commingle those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| so that's why you'll see this twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| In the second set will be much smaller amounts of money that come from ARPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| And other than that, just to echo what Commissioner Daley said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=563)|
| 0:09:27| the committee is functioning as effectively as I can imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| It has been a remarkable thing to behold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| I may have mentioned to this body, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| but Daley made the observation at one point that some version of this committee will exist 30 years from now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=578)|
| 0:09:44| and be doing this sort of work, and I think he's absolutely right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=584)|
| 0:09:48| It has just been an exceptional success so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=588)|
| 0:09:52| Thank you, Mr. VanVate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=592)|

| 0:09:57| The motion is to approve, which will move this to the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=603)|
| 0:10:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=604)|
| 0:10:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=605)|
| 0:10:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| Vice Chairman Biggs reminded me, I did want to recognize a couple of our officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| who joined us for tonight's work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=614)|
| 0:10:16| Mayor Jacobs, I believe is, yes, he's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| And in the tradition of one of my predecessors, Chairman Nystrom, Super Bob Thomas is in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| Welcome. Thank you for joining us, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=626)|
| 0:10:29| Tonight's agenda is relatively light in terms of the number of items we're discussing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=629)|
| 0:10:35| so I believe those are the only two elected folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| or elected by the school board, as the case may be, that have joined us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| So, Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=643)|
| 0:10:46| The next item is on page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=646)|
| 0:10:48| It's item number 44, resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| It's an election pursuant to TCA subsection 8-19-101F| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| to self-insure Knox County's risk of loss instead of obtaining certain bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| and insurance required under Tennessee law and the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| I actually pull this from consent, but Commissioner Smith, would you like to speak to this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| I just want to make a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| If anybody has any questions, I'll be able to read them, answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| Motion is to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Smith, second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=681)|
| 0:11:27| Commissioner Hill, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Commissioner Smith, I am assuming this is working well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=690)|
| 0:11:37| I'm not sure I understand your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| As far as us remaining self-insured as opposed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| Oh, yes, our self-insured status is perfectly fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| Just a real brief background on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| You all may remember in 2016 the state legislator passed a law that allowed us to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=709)|
| 0:11:56| instead of buying certain bonds to increase our crime policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| that allowed us to merge some things with the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| and do away with having to purchase bonds for a lot of elected officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| We did choose to keep the sheriff's bond due to liability reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| and the trustee's bonds due to the enormous amount of money that involves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| What the state has done is they've changed the law to where now you can self-insure these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=737)|
| 0:12:24| You don't have to buy the insurance policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| We were non-renewed by our insurance company this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| so we're out to market right now to get another policy, get a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| That's nothing alarming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| A lot of times during COVID, insurers, underwriters, and carriers went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| and reviewed their business platforms and chose to either enter or leave certain markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| We were with Axis, and they decided to leave the state of Tennessee market for crime policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| We're in the middle of getting a quote, and I was expecting to get that quote back today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| but I put this on here kind of as a placeholder for us to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Depending on what that quote comes back on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| I think my recommendation is we go ahead and buy the policy one more year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| because the state legislator is kind of famous for passing a law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| and then come back and tweaking it the next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| So sometimes it's best to let these things lie for a year or two before you obligate yourself to a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=795)|
| 0:13:22| But I wanted us to have that option in case the premium comes back way high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=802)|
| 0:13:26| or if we are unable to obtain a quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=806)|
| 0:13:31| And I should know that number by next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| What is the term of the policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| Is it a yearly renewal or a four-year renewal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| Our policy renews mid-October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=825)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| The motion is to move this forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=842)|
| 0:14:04| The vote is unanimous to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=848)|
| 0:14:10| Item number 46, Resolution 803 is authorizing a second amendment to development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| between Knox County and B&A Associates LLC relating to the Andrew Johnson Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| to extend the closing date in order to accommodate relocation of Knox County Schools' administrative offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=861)|
| 0:14:30| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you had pulled this from consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| so I'm going to recognize Commissioner Schoonmaker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| I guess make a motion to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| And then give Mr. Caldwell an opportunity to kind of update us on what the procedure here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| And the reason I pulled it is we're making an amendment to an agreement for the sale of the AJ building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=890)|
| 0:14:59| so I thought it would be a good opportunity to give finance the opportunity to update us on what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| The motion is to, was it to move forward without recommendation by Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=905)|
| 0:15:11| second by Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Mr. Caldwell, you have the floor, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Just to go over this a little bit and answer any of your questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=918)|
| 0:15:23| when we did the original agreement back in February or March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=923)|
| 0:15:27| we put a closing date of October 1 due to COVID, like with any other project that we saw due to COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=927)|
| 0:15:38| There have been some delays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Our demountable wall vendor had to file bankruptcy due to COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=941)|
| 0:15:45| and so we had to go back to the manufacturer to get that process going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| That was about a two-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| And so that led to a delay from the standpoint of moving in beginning in July and August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=955)|
| 0:16:01| so it's been about a two-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| And so PBA worked with schools to find a schedule that was less disruptive for them from a moving standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=963)|
| 0:16:14| Schools started to move in last week, and I think Russ said that he was part of that move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| and they're supposed to be moved in by November 15th, I think is the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| So mid-November, schools will be in the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=988)|
| 0:16:33| And so that process is positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| We're still trying to find a home for probation, merit system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=996)|
| 0:16:42| and there's one little small other entity that's over in the AJA building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| And so in doing that, by moving the deadline or the closing to March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| what it allows us to do is to find them a home, order the furniture so they're not rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| It also allows property management to get in the AJA building and clear it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| And so that takes some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| You think about everything that's in the AJA building has to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| And so that's a process, and so we'll go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1031)|
| 0:17:15| And so we worked with Phillip Walker at B&A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| and told him we would like to delay the closing from October to March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1039)|
| 0:17:26| knowing that he could say no and could begin charging us rent October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| He said be happy to move that to March 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| It actually lines up with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| His HUD loan doesn't close until March as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| So it kind of makes it correlate well with him on that time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| And so that's pretty much it in a nutshell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| What we would like to do, we've talked about having an open house end of October,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1071)|
| 0:17:58| 1st of November for commission and school board to look at the new space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| We'd also like to schedule a time to come maybe to the finance committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| to go over East Tower summer place plans, cost, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Because with COVID, there have been some cost increases, which aren't uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| And so we can go over those and also go over our plans to move the school board room to summer place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| which takes away all the issues of Real ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| And it also saves schools money from the standpoint of there's no overtime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| or utility costs related to TVA there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1114)|
| 0:18:37| And it's really more convenient from a security standpoint for the board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1117)|
| 0:18:43| And so I think everybody is happy with the process, and it's just getting it over the finish line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1123)|
| 0:18:50| And so all this really does is to accommodate us more as we finish the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1130)|

| 0:19:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| Mr. Caldwell, for all the excess equipment, desk chairs, filing cabinets, all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1143)|
| 0:19:12| you're saying that we would remove it from the building, haul it someplace for sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1152)|
| 0:19:18| or are we going to sell it in the building as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Our thought process is as of now when the A.J. building is to sell it floor by floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1161)|

| 0:19:58| The motion carries to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Item 48, Resolution 902, is amended to Knox County Commission Rules, Rule 1, Section B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1203)|
| 0:20:11| entitled Order of Business, to move the education and general government consent calendars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| to be listed after amendments to the agenda and before honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| I actually pulled this off consent just to give Commissioner Daly or someone from the Rules Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1222)|
| 0:20:28| an opportunity to speak to it if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| This was brought before the Rules Committee by myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| and I know the school system is very, very appreciative of not having it sit here for four hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| in public court in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| That's the main reason I wanted to bring this, is that our employees, our associates in the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1247)|
| 0:20:55| you know, they need to be, they work from 5, 6 o'clock in the morning until late at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| We need to get them here and out and do the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| And so the best way to do this was to put all their non-consent items right after the agenda set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1265)|
| 0:21:13| Hopefully everybody votes yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-210920?start=1273)|
