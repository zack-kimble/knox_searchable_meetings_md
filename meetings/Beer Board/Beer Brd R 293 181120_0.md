| 0:03:10| meeting you can pick up your permit. All right, thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=190)|
| 0:03:19| That was just a test. I'm glad nobody ran out. Hallie Gallion, Tennessee Wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| Company, 940 Blackstock Avenue. All right, Hallie. Sergeant Cower. No record. Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=207)|
| 0:03:33| The file was complete. Beautiful. Move to approve. Second. All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=213)|
| 0:03:48| All right. I don't see Clonaris come in yet, so we'll move on. So, Tennessee Wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=228)|
| 0:03:58| Okay, we got a couple updates from Clinch River Brewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=238)|
| 0:04:05| Hello, Kathy Taylor from Clinch River Brewing, 531 Gay Street. Okay, perfect. So it was approved pending final documentation 828.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=245)|
| 0:04:35| And here we are today, so give us an update. I am here to apply for a 90-day extension. Okay, or request a 90-day extension. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=275)|
| 0:04:47| And the reason for that 90-day extension would be? Construction woes. Okay, all right. Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=287)|
| 0:04:56| Miss Welch, you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=296)|
| 0:05:01| Thank you, Councilman. Can you just give us an update on the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| We have doors, we have windows, we have sheetrock, and we have part of the sheetrock on the ceiling now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=305)|
| 0:05:13| Okay. The last time I saw you, we had none of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| Okay, all right, great. What's the timeline? I mean, the 90 days, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| Actually, what we discussed was at least waiting until after the first of the year. We don't have the COA yet, so obviously we wouldn't be moving in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=324)|
| 0:05:35| But after the first of the year, I believe we're going to revisit that again with Brad, the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=335)|
| 0:05:41| And just sometime after that, we're not even going to try to push. Probably wouldn't be a good thing to do to downtown right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=341)|
| 0:05:49| Okay, all right, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| You feel comfortable that 90 days is enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| I hope so, yes. I can only speak for me, not Lisa and Brian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=357)|
| 0:06:02| We're very generous tonight, so I just want to make sure 90 days is enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| I'll make a motion to approve a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=365)|
| 0:06:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| All those in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=372)|
| 0:06:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=374)|
| 0:06:15| How's that, 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=375)|
| 0:06:16| Thanks, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=376)|
| 0:06:18| Okay, that was for, so we need another, so this is for the on-premise, on-off-premise, so we need another 90 days for it, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=378)|
| 0:06:29| I make a motion to approve the, yes, 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=389)|
| 0:06:36| On and off-premise, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| Pretty casual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=401)|
| 0:06:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=402)|
| 0:06:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=403)|
| 0:06:44| All those in favor, say aye. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=404)|
| 0:06:47| All right, let's have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| Elst Brewing Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=410)|
| 0:06:57| Shane Todd, Elst Brewing Company, 2417-2419, North Central, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| So May 22nd, you were approved, pending final documentation, an 8-28 extension to today, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=424)|
| 0:07:12| Yep, I did pick up the manufacturing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=432)|
| 0:07:15| I'm just here asking for, requesting an extension, if it's possible, for the retail on-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=435)|
| 0:07:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| What do you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=442)|

| 0:07:25| 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=445)|
| 0:07:26| Yeah, just construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| I motion to approve the 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=448)|
| 0:07:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=451)|
| 0:07:33| All those in favor, say aye. Aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=453)|
| 0:07:35| How's that, 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=455)|

| 0:07:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Mr. Clares, I see you, and we'll get back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=460)|
| 0:07:43| Thank you, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| Quality restaurant concepts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=465)|
| 0:07:58| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| Danny Hodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=481)|
| 0:08:02| This is for Applebee's Restaurant Merchants Road, 5316 Central Avenue Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| So, January of 17, you're cited for sale to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| February, you submitted a revised remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=497)|
| 0:08:22| You had a hearing in the end of February of 17, cited again October of 2018 for sale to minor, the second and two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=502)|
| 0:08:34| Notice was given, 1029 for administrative hearing, 1113 revised remedial plan, and fine was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=514)|
| 0:08:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=522)|
| 0:08:43| Where are you tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Where are you now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| We have completed a lot of the things, the administrative part of the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=527)|
| 0:08:54| We have the changes from the first plan to the second plan highlighted in yellow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=534)|
| 0:09:01| so you can see what we're doing differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| We currently have ID scanners in every restaurant in Knoxville, every restaurant in Tennessee, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| They're about $1,300 a piece, so we make sure all those are still working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=553)|
| 0:09:17| We scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=557)|
| 0:09:18| The problem is getting a crew member to actually do it, and that seems to be where we fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| They think they can do the math in their head instead of, so it is mandatory that all IDs go through the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=563)|
| 0:09:30| So they take the ID from the table and go back to the scanner at the bar and then bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=570)|
| 0:09:36| Bring it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=578)|
| 0:09:40| Any questions for Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Can you tell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=584)|
| 0:09:45| I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=585)|
| 0:09:48| Just a quick question, because we had somebody else bring this up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| You're saying that they check the date, they read it, they do the math, but they're supposed to scan it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| but you can't always get them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| If they make a personal choice, that's why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| Someone tried to do the math in their head and they were off by a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=603)|
| 0:10:06| So we had another similar situation where they changed to a system where the drink would not be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=606)|
| 0:10:13| and put into a glass until it had been scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=613)|
| 0:10:16| We have the same process, and they also have to enter the date of birth into the computer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| so it prints on the check for the bartender to make the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| If there's no date, there's no drink made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| So you do have that check in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| Now they have to scan it to get the drink made?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| Because you're saying that in the past they were making the choice not to scan it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| It's policy to scan the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=635)|
| 0:10:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| It's policy to enter the date into the POS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=638)|
| 0:10:40| But if they don't enter a date into the POS, the bartender won't make the drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| So that is the new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=647)|
| 0:10:56| Two times in two years is more than enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| More than enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Three times is going to be a lot worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| So hopefully with the new equipment and the new training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| So anybody else got any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=669)|
| 0:11:11| Our choices are we can accept what they've submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| or if we feel that for some reason it was not adequate, we can send it on to a hearing officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=675)|
| 0:11:23| If we feel that it's adequate, we'll just accept it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| If they have another violation, they can send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=686)|
| 0:11:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=690)|

| 0:11:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| Next up is Red Lobster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=704)|

| 0:12:01| It's good to see you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=721)|
| 0:12:04| I was just here, I believe, a couple of weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| State your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| 511 Union Street, Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| 511 Union Street, Suite 2700, Nashville, Tennessee, 37219,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| from the law firm of Waller-Lanston in Nashville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| So September 17, recited for sale of minor was the first in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| 10-16-17, law department filed a noncompliance complaint against the permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| for not submitting remedial plan in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| 10-23-17, remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| 12-7-17, agreed order was entered and included a $250 fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| and demissal of the complaint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| 10-25-2018, cited to the sale of a minor was the second in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=769)|
| 0:12:56| 10-29, notice of administrative hearing was sent and received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Remedial plan was received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| November 13-18, deadline to receive the fine, at least five days prior to the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=782)|
| 0:13:09| And then 11-14, the law department filed a noncompliance complaint against the permittee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=789)|
| 0:13:14| for not submitting the fine in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| So tell us where we are and what you have to submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Actually, right before the meeting, I'm sorry, I've got the general manager at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| Mr. Mike Carroll with me, and the director of operations for the Mid-Atlantic Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| She's got three states, Ms. Crystal Worrell with me as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| Just wanted to reiterate, and before the meeting started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| I passed along a copy of the revised remedial plan that we have on that second sale of minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| second sale to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| The revised remedial plan should be on each person's desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| And if you all just don't mind, I would like to, again, bring word back from corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| that we're incredibly very sorry that this happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=840)|
| 0:14:03| Red Lobster wants to be a good member and good standing of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=843)|
| 0:14:07| and we're taking the sale of alcohol to minors very, very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| That's why they've sent me down here from Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| and they've got two of their operations team here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| But just wanted to briefly talk about what happened in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| First of all, the person who made the sale has been with Red Lobster for the last 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=860)|
| 0:14:27| is at a server ID, ABC server ID, since the state made one available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| And so he's passed multiple sting operations, but for some reason this time around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| it just simply happened to miss it, and so we're deeply sorry for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=878)|
| 0:14:42| But in accordance with our policy, unfortunately, we had to terminate the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| because we have a zero tolerance policy for sale of alcohol to minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| That's how much we take it that serious,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| even though this has been a valuable employee that we've had for the last 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| In addition to that, we're now starting a universal carding program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=899)|
| 0:15:03| where we card every single person that comes in the door and orders alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| And part of the problem, again, is that we're finding that the challenge is being able to remind employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| on a daily basis of the importance of serving alcohol to minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| the importance of reminding them about that born-on-date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| And so there are a couple of measures that we've taken to improve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| One is that every single day, every single shift, the manager is constantly beating that born-on-date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| in every server and bartender's head so that we're constantly reminding them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| that this is the date you should be looking at whenever you look at ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| And if that doesn't comply, then you've got to figure out a way to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| that you're double-checking whatever that date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| So part of that process is that we have each server has a server book.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| And in that book, they're required to have a slip in that book that contains the born-on-date on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=951)|
| 0:15:58| And again, the purpose of that is that if a server gets an ID and they're unsure about the born-on-date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| they're supposed to make references to that server book to make sure that they're getting the date correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| In addition to that, the POS system that we have has got the born-on-date printed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=970)|
| 0:16:16| And I've attached a sample of that for you all's reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=976)|
| 0:16:19| You would note that it's actually in red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=979)|
| 0:16:23| Sorry for this color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| It's in red, and you would note that it's got the born-on-date on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| So what happens is when a server takes an order, they write it down on the order sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| and then they take it down to the register.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=995)|
| 0:16:37| And I believe this was from one of your suggestions from the last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| We've now been implementing that at this restaurant to make sure that they're writing it down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1003)|
| 0:16:47| taking it to the register, entering the date to make sure that they actually get it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1007)|
| 0:16:54| Again, another thing that we've added to our process is to make sure that each server| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1014)|
| 0:16:59| and bartender are now required to sign a daily sign-in sheet that reminds them of what the born-on-date is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1019)|
| 0:17:06| A copy of that I've also enclosed for your reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| And you see that it's got a brief statement on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| It's got the born-on-date in really huge prints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| and all servers and bartenders are required to sign that before they begin their shift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1035)|
| 0:17:24| In addition to that, another thing that we're doing, like going across the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1044)|
| 0:17:30| and preaching this message to all the different beer boards is the importance of red box ID carding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| There is no math that has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| We're just trying to get the words out to the servers that all you have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| if you've got a Tennessee ID, and I'll caution that is only applies to Tennessee ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| look at the red box on it, the born-on-date when the person turns 21 is on the side of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| And so we're retraining all of our servers about this process and getting that message out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| so that whenever they do come across this situation, they don't have to do any math at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| Just look at the date, and you're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| In addition to that, though, we're making sure that when someone does see a red box on a card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1088)|
| 0:18:14| they call a manager over to verify the born-on-date before they actually make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| Now, for out-of-state IDs, what we are telling all our servers and bartenders is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1100)|
| 0:18:26| if you see an ID that doesn't match the slip that you have in your book,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1106)|
| 0:18:31| you think that you have any sort of suspicion that this person might not be over 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1111)|
| 0:18:39| call a manager over to help you double-check that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| And so we believe, again, that if we have two sets of high looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| we can reduce the human error that comes with trying to make some sort of math calculation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| as to how old that person is and to determine the appropriate date to make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1131)|
| 0:18:58| So that secondary ID carding is very, very crucial to our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| Like I told you all last time, we find that to be very, very efficient all across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1142)|
| 0:19:08| Another thing that we're doing is the restaurant is posting colored copies of underage IDs all across the restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1148)|
| 0:19:15| So, again, we're reminding folks about what underage IDs look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| again, posting signs around the restaurant as to what born-on-date they should be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1159)|
| 0:19:23| And we believe all of these things will help to reduce the human error that typically occurs in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1163)|
| 0:19:29| We're retraining all of our bartenders and servers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| and we're also continuing to make sure that we're continuing our internal check programs through bars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1173)|
| 0:19:39| and also putting in different incentive programs for servers that do pass this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| as a way to sort of uplift the spirit among our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1186)|
| 0:19:50| and to let them know that this is something that we really take seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| and that if they do comply, we are more than happy to give them some sort of reward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1193)|
| 0:19:59| So with all these plans, we believe that we're going to significantly reduce, hopefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1199)|
| 0:20:04| the sale of alcohol to minor at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1204)|
| 0:20:07| and we're just hoping for some of the generosity that the board chair mentioned earlier on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1207)|
| 0:20:14| that the board please give us some leniency today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| Happy to take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1218)|
| 0:20:22| I'd like to ask, has the fine been paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| It says here that they filed a noncompliance complaint against the permittee for submitting the fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1225)|
| 0:20:31| not submitting it in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| Has that been satisfied?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| It has since been paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1234)|
| 0:20:35| Okay, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| I do want to comment that it appears that Red Lobster has taken some aggressive measures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| to ensure that this does not happen again, up to and including the zero tolerance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| So I do think that that indicates to this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| that you definitely understand the severity of these actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1252)|

| 0:21:11| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1271)|
| 0:21:13| So our choices are to accept the plan that they've submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| or if you found any disappointment with that, then we could descend it on to what you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1278)|

| 0:22:18| Come join us, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1338)|
| 0:22:19| You're missing out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| I hear good things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| It's a big hit for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1342)|
| 0:22:23| It'll be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| Can you tell us a little bit about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Thank you for the offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| So some of you might remember a restaurant 18 years ago called Kalamata Kitchen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| It was out in West Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1354)|
| 0:22:36| We had one in Western Plaza, and subsequently we closed it in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| For 18 years, I have had people every single day beg me to reopen a Greek restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| And my wife and I have kind of waited for the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| We're at the right age to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| We have resources to do it the way we wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| So we opened up a restaurant called Keffie, which means that inner place inside each of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1375)|
| 0:23:03| that drives us to our passions, our zest for life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| not passions like you might be thinking, George, but our zest for life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| the things that drive us to do well in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| And it's just a fantastic restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| It's a small plate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| We call it mezzi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| You've probably heard it called tapas before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| We do have a bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| We do have beer, effectively, tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| So we'll order it tonight and hopefully get it after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| But I do, I would love to have everybody come and check it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1410)|
| 0:23:33| It's the kind of place that you can be proud of in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| and it will bring people, more people, down into the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| kind of raising the bar down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| So thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1422)|
| 0:23:44| Great. Thanks a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1424)|
| 0:23:45| Good luck, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1426)|
| 0:23:48| Being no further business, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrdR293181120?start=1431)|
