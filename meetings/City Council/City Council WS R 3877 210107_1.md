| 1:48:50| And so that's the end of my comments for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6536)|
| 1:48:56| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6536)|
| 1:49:00| I just want to say, so, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| there's things like we've talked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| I've asked for years well before I was on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6544)|
| 1:49:06| for protected bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6546)|
| 1:49:08| And so the answer sometimes to why we couldn't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6548)|
| 1:49:11| was they're too expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6551)|
| 1:49:13| You know, we only have enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| to do the road improvements that we have to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6555)|
| 1:49:17| or we do do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| So I asked basically to do some of the tactical urbanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6560)|
| 1:49:25| like let's try it in some places in a temporary way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6565)|
| 1:49:28| And so engineering got permission from TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| to do it in a particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| But then the barrier was we needed the street sweeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6573)|
| 1:49:35| that would be able to get into that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6575)|
| 1:49:37| You know, a smaller street sweeper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| because they fill up with glass and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Dr. Cooley and I were riding one time on Woodland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| and there were bricks and all kinds of crazy things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| in the bike lane there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| So that street sweeper was in the last city budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6588)|
| 1:49:51| but then COVID hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6591)|
| 1:49:53| And so if we can't have the street sweeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6593)|
| 1:49:55| we can't have protected bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| And my argument is once we invest in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| whether it's through tactical urbanism,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6601)|
| 1:50:03| you know, those attached orange things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6603)|
| 1:50:06| that you could drive into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| versus an actual curbed out protected bike lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| which, you know, I'm sure Councilwoman Parker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6611)|
| 1:50:14| saw plenty of those types of protected bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6614)|
| 1:50:16| over in Europe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6616)|
| 1:50:18| They get practically their own roadways over there on bikes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| because it is a transportation form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6621)|
| 1:50:23| Whereas here, I've been seen walking on Sutherland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| and people like, or I had three people one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6627)|
| 1:50:29| ask me if I needed a ride because they saw me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| people that knew me, like, do you need a ride?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6632)|
| 1:50:35| No, I'm actually walking because it's intentional here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6635)|
| 1:50:38| I mean, we look sometimes at pedestrian and bike transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| as your car must be broke down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| why did you make that choice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| It's like, no, this might be my choice to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| And so we need to make it our norm, our cultural norm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| and we haven't provided the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| Looking at some of the other Vision Zero cities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6656)|
| 1:50:59| they've invested and budgeted for additional traffic lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| They've targeted and looked at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6663)|
| 1:51:05| Ellen Zaviska has presented that information to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6665)|
| 1:51:07| I can't remember exactly when it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6667)|
| 1:51:10| but I'm pretty sure it's this new group of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6670)|
| 1:51:12| We got that presentation from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6672)|
| 1:51:14| where she did all these studies about pedestrian crashes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6674)|
| 1:51:18| And, you know, we've identified that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6678)|
| 1:51:20| We know that Cecil and Broadway is one of the primary places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| So we got a study that said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| this is what it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6687)|
| 1:51:28| to make this a safer intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| And we have to commit the money to fix the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| because it's a terrible intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| that's incredibly dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| We've identified Hall of Fame and Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6697)|
| 1:51:39| as a dangerous and terrible intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| We've identified Rutledge, Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| and Asheville Highway, Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6704)|
| 1:51:46| as a terrible bike-ped intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6706)|
| 1:51:50| that it's not just about changing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6710)|
| 1:51:53| to make it a different look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6713)|
| 1:51:55| it's about making it safer for people to get around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6715)|
| 1:51:57| and it bisects the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6717)|
| 1:51:59| So when you say you're going to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| yeah, you're committing to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6722)|
| 1:52:04| when I plan these projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6724)|
| 1:52:05| I'm going to budget in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| to fix these roadways in a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| rather than just repaving them as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6728)|
| 1:52:12| They have to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6732)|
| 1:52:13| We have some bad intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| that will have to get changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6735)|
| 1:52:21| Council Member Barto, did you have your hand up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6741)|
| 1:52:25| then we'll go to Councilwoman Vivian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6745)|
| 1:52:28| I did, Vice Mayor, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6748)|
| 1:52:30| Mr. Hill, really appreciate the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6750)|
| 1:52:33| And just like my colleagues have said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| I'm fully supportive of what you're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6756)|
| 1:52:39| with Division Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6759)|
| 1:52:41| Certainly my day job, I guess, I'm involved in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6761)|
| 1:52:46| I get to see a lot of the results of what happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6766)|
| 1:52:48| when something like this happens or somebody's injured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6768)|
| 1:52:52| And it's very tragic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6772)|
| 1:52:55| It can affect people in many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| Some of them are physical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| and some of them can be mental as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6779)|
| 1:53:00| It's a difficult thing and anything we can do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| and I agree with my colleague, Council Member Fugate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6784)|
| 1:53:07| anything we could do to drive that down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| everyone would be supportive of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6789)|
| 1:53:11| So I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6791)|
| 1:53:13| Certainly one of the things we're talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| is infrastructure, but we've got a lot of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6795)|
| 1:53:21| in traffic calming in the city right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| It's one of our most popular programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| I could see how this can work with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| I see a lot of ways that you could branch from these goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| into several different priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| that we've already been talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6818)|
| 1:53:40| So I see it working pretty seamlessly there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| So one thing I was gonna ask you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6823)|
| 1:53:45| do you see that kind of connection as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6825)|
| 1:53:49| And then the other question I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6829)|
| 1:53:51| was just about distracted driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| because certainly I see a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| And I'm just wondering if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6836)|
| 1:53:59| I didn't hear anything in the presentation about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6839)|
| 1:54:02| but obviously we're all seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6842)|
| 1:54:06| And what can we do, or is that part of the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| Is there something we should also be looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| with distractions and folks taking responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6852)|
| 1:54:17| for being aware of the road environment in front of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6857)|
| 1:54:21| I don't know if you have any comments on that either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6861)|
| 1:54:23| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6863)|
| 1:54:24| I have a couple of comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| It used to be the conversation around traffic safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| used to focus on what they call the E's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6871)|
| 1:54:33| engineering, enforcement, education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| But more recently, the conversation has changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6877)|
| 1:54:41| towards providing systemic solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| So you're looking at entire systems and how they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| and how they work with one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6887)|
| 1:54:50| That said, everything has to work together towards this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6890)|
| 1:54:54| And that's why Vision Zero is an effective platform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6894)|
| 1:54:58| for addressing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6898)|
| 1:54:58| because the highest elected official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6898)|
| 1:55:00| sets a specific date with a specific goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| and then all the departments are working towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| So when you have enforcement, the police department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6906)|
| 1:55:09| looking at distracted driving with the mindset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| of we're working towards this goal of zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| then it changes how they interact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| with the laws and rules and norms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6919)|
| 1:55:23| they're supposed to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6923)|
| 1:55:25| So I think, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| I think not only does it support it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| but it more effectively supports it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6928)|
| 1:55:29| than anything we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6929)|
| 1:55:31| Okay, thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6931)|
| 1:55:34| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6934)|
| 1:55:40| Just keep talking, it'll come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| I unmuted myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6942)|
| 1:55:44| Well, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| Y'all, I unmuted myself when Andrew started talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6946)|
| 1:55:49| so this would not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6949)|
| 1:55:51| Well, we hear you now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6951)|
| 1:55:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6952)|
| 1:55:54| So all I was gonna say to Councilwoman Ryder's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| I think one of the things that we're going to have to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6960)|
| 1:56:04| a real decision on and be prepared to handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6964)|
| 1:56:08| is that money is finite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6968)|
| 1:56:11| And so some of the issues that she's talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6971)|
| 1:56:16| will mean we do less projects if we do them more fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| That's just, that's my financial hat coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| that funds are not unlimited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| And so there will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| that's just part of the education piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| that if you're gonna talk about doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| is that there will be parts of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| that don't get projects done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| Things may take longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7000)|
| 1:56:42| if we do other projects more correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| I just think, you know, yeah, we can raise taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| but there's only so many times you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| Money is not infinite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7013)|
| 1:56:56| So that was just a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7016)|
| 1:56:58| I'm not disagreeing with you, Councilwoman Ryder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| I'm just saying that it will have an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7021)|
| 1:57:04| on how much we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| Thank you, Councilwoman Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| I just wanna tack onto that as an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7030)|
| 1:57:13| of something before all of us were on council is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7033)|
| 1:57:15| and it's a TDOT project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7035)|
| 1:57:17| And I'm sure if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7037)|
| 1:57:19| from the engineering department here was here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7039)|
| 1:57:21| they might correct some of what I might say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| But when the I-640 interchange at Broadway was redesigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7043)|
| 1:57:28| the city was pushing for greenway bike option through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| as well as the sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7053)|
| 1:57:37| TDOT did put the sidewalk in when it went through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7057)|
| 1:57:40| So you're talking multimillion dollar project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| but it's not their priority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7063)|
| 1:57:45| so they wouldn't accommodate for a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| for bikes to get through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7068)|
| 1:57:50| I am appreciative for the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| because if anybody remembers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| there was a worn path on the side in the dirt and the grass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7075)|
| 1:57:59| for people who were walking to get their groceries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| from the food city on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| So thank heavens there's now a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7084)|
| 1:58:07| because it was ridiculous and unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7087)|
| 1:58:10| But it's like when you're spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| that many millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7092)|
| 1:58:13| it's unacceptable that TDOT wasn't willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| to put all the infrastructure in there that needed to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7097)|
| 1:58:20| because that's a massive project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| And I refuse to accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| that there was no way to put it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7105)|
| 1:58:27| So anyway, that's just an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7107)|
| 1:58:31| You spent a lot of money and you didn't do everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7111)|
| 1:58:33| that you needed to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7113)|
| 1:58:34| and it's not gonna happen in any of our lifetimes again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| that particular intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7117)|
| 1:58:41| I wanna follow up on that and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| that's part of why you generate the action plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| is so that you can not only just not just see one project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7128)|
| 1:58:52| and see how expensive it is and throw your hands up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7132)|
| 1:58:54| but know what all of the projects are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| how they're prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7137)|
| 1:58:59| This is all about making this a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| and understanding what the priorities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7141)|
| 1:59:04| and how they relate to everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| And then having a list of options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| that are not only just expensive ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7149)|
| 1:59:11| but lower cost ones as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I mean, oftentimes, education is overlooked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| or there are solutions that you can come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7156)|
| 1:59:20| with changing policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7160)|
| 1:59:22| Just to throw out an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7162)|
| 1:59:26| the crossing of Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7166)|
| 1:59:31| where Central crosses, or I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| where Gay Street crosses Hall of Fame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| having places like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7175)|
| 1:59:37| where there are signalized crosswalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7177)|
| 1:59:41| lengthening the time that crosswalk signals are given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7181)|
| 1:59:45| things of that nature that can really impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| how people use the pedestrian environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| and feel safer in their space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7191)|
| 1:59:53| So that was just to throw out a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| I don't know that that's, I don't wanna get in the weeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7197)|
| 1:59:59| but the point being is you have a list of options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7199)|
| 2:00:02| you know what they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7202)|
| 2:00:03| and you know what's the low-hanging fruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| and how things are prioritized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Yes, and this is just to follow up some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| on Councilwoman Leiter's comments about the 640.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7216)|
| 2:00:22| Yes, I remember all about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7222)|
| 2:00:24| And what is a little scary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7224)|
| 2:00:27| was that TDOT's final plans didn't even include any access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| And they had already began to work on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| or at least it was deep into the planning stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| And if no one had been paying attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7242)|
| 2:00:45| they would have built it without any access at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7245)|
| 2:00:48| which would have limited forever, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7248)|
| 2:00:52| any kind of pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| between Fountain City and the larger part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| So one function that I can see for this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7259)|
| 2:01:05| is to kind of monitor kind of construction projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| and what are going on when TDOT is beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7270)|
| 2:01:14| to alter a road or build a new road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7274)|
| 2:01:18| or any major, either major project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7278)|
| 2:01:21| We need people to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7281)|
| 2:01:23| that that doesn't fall through the cracks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| because it can, it absolutely can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| And the next thing you know, TDOT's built the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| and we're forever barred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| or without major, major retrofitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7295)|
| 2:01:41| we're really stuck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7301)|
| 2:01:43| So that would be, I think, a really good function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7303)|
| 2:01:47| This is just kind of a overall view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| of what kind of transportation across the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| changes were being made and to kind of monitor those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7314)|
| 2:01:57| to see how they fit with our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7317)|
| 2:02:00| for more pedestrian access, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7320)|
| 2:02:06| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Yeah, just to tie some of these threads together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7327)|
| 2:02:11| one of the opportunities we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7331)|
| 2:02:14| for this specific topic is Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7334)|
| 2:02:16| As you remember, previous council administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| put together Chapman Highway Safety Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7339)|
| 2:02:23| TDOT has funding for Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| so this particular reconciliation of our need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| for safe pedestrian and traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| safety and funding and state control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7355)|
| 2:02:40| will come up for that really important highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7360)|
| 2:02:44| So just, we got an opportunity right in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7364)|
| 2:02:47| for, to get something like this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7367)|
| 2:02:52| Thank you, Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7372)|
| 2:02:55| And Tim, I also want to kind of tie this into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7375)|
| 2:02:58| Mr. Hill, one of his slides actually showed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7378)|
| 2:03:00| you know, the steering committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7380)|
| 2:03:02| the action plan and the implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7382)|
| 2:03:04| where I can only make the assumption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7384)|
| 2:03:08| that a lot of these things that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| will come into play into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| at that juncture with the steering committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| as they're going through an action plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7395)|
| 2:03:17| and looking at what the implementation plan will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| and hopefully that we will continue to get updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| You know, I agree with my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7405)|
| 2:03:26| and I support this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7406)|
| 2:03:28| We all want to have a very safe community and city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7408)|
| 2:03:33| for biking and walking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7413)|
| 2:03:34| And so anything that we can do to help promote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7414)|
| 2:03:37| and make that happen, I think is in our best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7417)|
| 2:03:41| And so this has been a really informative presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210107?start=7421)|
