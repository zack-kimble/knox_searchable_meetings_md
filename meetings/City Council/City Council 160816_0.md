| 0:02:02| For the mayor's report, there are a few events that are coming up that I want you to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=122)|
| 0:02:07| about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| As council members already know, you recently voted to rename a street in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=128)|
| 0:02:13| in honor of Bill Bourne, who has for years operated Jarnagin and Son Mortuary on Martin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| Luther King, Jr., and has served the local community in numerous ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| We will have the official ceremony and unveiling of the new street signs tomorrow, August 17th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=144)|
| 0:02:31| at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| That will be at the corner of the former Milligan Street and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| near Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=158)|
| 0:02:40| I know Mr. Bourne will be there along with friends and family, so I hope everyone can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=160)|
| 0:02:44| come out and help recognize him and his contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=164)|
| 0:02:47| Again, that's tomorrow, August 17th, at 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| This Friday, our friends at the Knoxville Chamber have organized a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| It's called the Endeavor Young Professionals Summit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| It will be at the Mill and Mine on Depot Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| It aims to create a space for young professionals from across our region to get engaged, make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| connections, and provide opportunities to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| The goal is to recruit, retain, and empower young professionals in the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=192)|
| 0:03:18| The day will be full of sessions with national and local leaders, including our own Jay Rogers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=198)|
| 0:03:24| from Local Motors and Amy Lynch of Generational Edge, as well as some familiar city faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| Our COO, Christy Branska, and our business liaison, Patricia Robledo, are both on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=216)|
| 0:03:38| And I get to do the welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| There's still time to register online at ypsummitknox.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=220)|
| 0:03:48| So if you're a young professional or you have some young professionals who work with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| it's worth taking a look, and hopefully you will register and send them on to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| Again, the summit for young professionals will be from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| August 19th, at the Mill and Mine, followed by a happy hour and after party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| You can't just come to the after party and happy hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| You need to go to the session first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=255)|
| 0:04:18| If you're under 70, you probably can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=258)|
| 0:04:20| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=260)|
| 0:04:21| Yes, I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| Well, we want them to go to the full day event, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=262)|
| 0:04:23| If you're under 70, are you a young professional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=263)|
| 0:04:26| It's all in the mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=266)|
| 0:04:29| So I want to remind you also about the upcoming meeting next Thursday, August 25th, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| city staff and consultants will give an update on the improvements at Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| That meeting will be at 5.30 p.m. in the Lions Club building in Fountain City Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=280)|
| 0:04:45| You can learn about the new fountain system and pump house and plans for the introduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=285)|
| 0:04:50| of a new wetland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| As you all know, this is a several-phase project, and so this is, I think, the last phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| I believe it's the last phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=299)|
| 0:05:01| And so, again, that meeting is 5.30 p.m. on Thursday, August 25th, in the Lions Club building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=301)|
| 0:05:07| about the improvements to Fountain City Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| And finally, a very special thank you gift to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=309)|
| 0:05:13| Many of us attended the Smoky Mountain Air Show last April at McGee-Tyson Airport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| It was a great weekend, sunny skies, big crowds, and pretty amazing aerial performances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=317)|
| 0:05:25| After we were entertained and awed by the acrobatic teams and the Blue Angels, the show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=325)|
| 0:05:30| generated $350,000 in proceeds that will help Honor Air Knoxville in its mission to salute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=330)|
| 0:05:38| the service and sacrifice of our veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=338)|
| 0:05:41| So that's pretty impressive right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Travis Gardner, who's vice president of operations for Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| – are you here, Travis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Okay, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| He's here tonight to say a few words and to make a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=352)|
| 0:05:55| So thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=355)|
| 0:05:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| And it's a great pleasure to be before City Council tonight because it means I'm not the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| only guy in the room wearing a bow tie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| But just a few quick words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=364)|
| 0:06:06| I get to do something tonight that I'm honored to do, and I never want to pass up the chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=366)|
| 0:06:11| to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=371)|
| 0:06:13| So on behalf of the five-member partnership that brought you the 2016 Smoky Mountain Air| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=373)|
| 0:06:17| Show – again, that partnership consisted of the City of Knoxville, Knox County Government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| Blount County Government, our friends with the Tennessee Air National Guard at McGee-Tyson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| Air National Guard Base, as well as the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority – were able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| partner together and bring you the 2016 Smoky Mountain Air Show that did highlight the U.S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=392)|
| 0:06:38| Navy Blue Angels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| I'm here tonight to present a token of appreciation back to the community from the Blue Angels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| I do this representing the Air Show, but it's in honor and representation, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| of the Blue Angels and their way of saying thank you for your support from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| Again, I want to reiterate the Mayor's fine words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| We accomplished several things with the Smoky Mountain Air Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| One, we were able to generate some funds to support a great community organization that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| does so many things to support the most revered and hallowed members of our community that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| certainly deserve anything and everything that we can do to support them, which is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=437)|
| 0:07:18| And we were able to do that by supporting Honor Air Knoxville with $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| Again, our goal was to raise some funds so that they can focus on supporting the veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| and they can catch their breath for a moment and take a pause for generating and raising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=454)|
| 0:07:35| I'm also happy to report there were some ancillary benefits to bringing the Air Show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| If you had a hot dog, if you had a Coke, if you had some concessions, that activity alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| generated over $80,000 that went back to the community groups that were willing to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| and act as concessionaires vending those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=472)|
| 0:07:59| I am sad to report we were able to have enough funds left over after the contribution to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=479)|
| 0:08:06| fund a memorial directly to the surviving family of Commander Jamie Koos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| Jamie Koos was one of the flyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| He was number six for the Blue Angels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| Unfortunately, he had a fatal accident just almost a month after our Air Show in Smyrna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=496)|
| 0:08:23| Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| He was survived by a young wife and two wonderful young children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| We were able to make that contribution through the ICAST Foundation to directly support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| It's a gesture on behalf of the partnership and the East Tennessee community to say thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=512)|
| 0:08:38| you to the Blue Angels for bringing this fantastic performance and thank you for that sacrifice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=518)|
| 0:08:44| that they're willing to make to keep our nation safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=524)|
| 0:08:48| I'm also overwhelmed to report we brought a premier Air Show back to East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=528)|
| 0:08:57| We now have more finite estimates supported by the Blue Angels that report we had over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=537)|
| 0:09:03| one hundred, their estimates were between 140 and 160,000 people on the airport, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=543)|

| 0:12:37| what we're selling it for, and she has a very good reason, and I think you'd be in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| line by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=762)|

| 0:12:44| Becky Wade, Director of Community Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Yes, there's always more to the story here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| We did purchase this property in a negotiated sale from the owner for $55,000, but out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=769)|
| 0:12:57| that came $17,000 in back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| So we reimbursed the city $17,000 for taxes that they owed on that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=781)|
| 0:13:11| It is extremely blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| The roof has fallen in, some of the ceiling has dropped down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| It was very overgrown for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| I think there were 16 lot violations on it, several property violations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=801)|
| 0:13:27| So this is very welcome by the community to change hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=807)|
| 0:13:34| This was listed in our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=814)|

| 0:13:44| when the buyer is going to invest close to $60,000 in this to get it back occupied and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=824)|
| 0:13:54| on the tax rolls, it was certainly worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| Good, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=838)|

| 0:16:17| As my colleagues, and Mayor, as you're aware, that sometimes I've gotten embroiled in sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| situations, and this is a sidewalk in my district, and would like to just have a little public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| information concerning how this sidewalk jumped ahead of five other sidewalks in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=986)|
| 0:16:32| and as I believe this is not even on the list, but would just like some explanation so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| we can explain it to the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| So, Jim, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| I was not able to get a hold of you this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1000)|

| 0:16:48| This one's been in the pipeline for at least three years, probably three and a half years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1008)|
| 0:16:53| and we've actually already purchased some right-of-way for it through Council, but the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| big driver on this one is access to the Veterans Administration Clinic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1019)|
| 0:17:05| It was a fairly small project with a lot of payback, a lot of benefit for some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1025)|
| 0:17:11| who really benefit from it, and so it kind of skipped the rating process, but it does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1031)|
| 0:17:22| score pretty high, so it gets like a 12, which is right up there at the top, even if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1042)|
| 0:17:30| don't consider the benefit to that class of people who aren't covered by the prioritization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| We actually had multiple requests from the Veterans Administration to provide that link| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1057)|
| 0:17:43| to the bus stop to help the veterans who were trying to get there for the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| Well, and I know that the bus, they changed the bus line, what, in the last year, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| know, to move it over to Ramirez Boulevard, and I also know that they just finished that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| in the last two years, maybe, finished the hospital part or the clinic on that, so, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| I just wanted an understanding so that people would understand why this particular sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1082)|

| 0:19:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| I'd just like a little explanation on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| I mean, we're a parking lot on Magnolia right in the middle of our Magnolia Corridor redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| district, right across from the CNS Laundry that we're pouring money into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| I have gotten a plan since we've been sitting here tonight, but I haven't had it prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1215)|
| 0:20:18| that as far as what that's going to look like, so I don't know who can speak to that best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1218)|
| 0:20:24| Is Don Distler here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| I can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Right here on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Don Michelle Foss, Director of Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1230)|
| 0:20:32| We have been working with CAT, who had some funding from FTA to get parking for this employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| We jumped on that immediately because we know the importance of the corner and also the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| Magnolia Avenue Streetscape Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1245)|
| 0:20:46| So what we did, we wanted to couple our design consultant with the streetscape plan and along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1246)|
| 0:20:53| with the design of the employee parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1253)|
| 0:20:57| As you know, this is on CAT's route, and Don Distler, if you're here, you can jump in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1257)|
| 0:21:02| time if I'm doing okay, but ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1263)|
| 0:21:08| Really, it complements the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| FTA had provided that funding to CAT to move forward with the employee parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1270)|
| 0:21:14| They were going to do that no matter what, so as long as the corridor project was moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| forward, we wanted to make sure it was complemented and was screened and shielded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| We understand that urban design is of very top importance when we're doing the streetscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| project, so we wanted to couple that parking lot along with the streetscape project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| It's going to be shielded with landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| It's going to have some great amenities, and it does complement that number one bus line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| along Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1301)|
| 0:21:45| So is there any structure at all to make it look like ... I mean, this is the very beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1305)|
| 0:21:50| of your Magnolia Corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| Adjacent to that is our proposed gateway monument entryway, so our design consultant has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| working with engineering, our department as well, and CAT in regards to what that corner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| You're going to have the parking lot there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| You're going to have the proposed gateway monument, which we haven't really put out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| there yet, but we have a design for that, and we're going to couple all that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| So both ends, both east and west sides of North and South sides of Magnolia Avenue will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| have complementary corners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| So the adjacent parking lot behind it has chain link fence, and is that going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| part of it on Magnolia?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| I can't look at the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Now, CAT can add to whatever improvements are going on outside of the footprint of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| they're working on now, but we're just going to design the footprint of that parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1360)|
| 0:22:46| to complement the streetscape design with landscaping, ornamental brick, and decorative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1366)|
| 0:22:53| fencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| I've not seen the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| I just find it odd that we're building a parking lot on Magnolia, right in the very front of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1379)|
| 0:23:05| where we're trying to redevelop and encourage redevelopment, when surface parking lots can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| be a real, can stagnate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| That's what you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| And since this project has already gone out to bid, the construction documents are available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1395)|
| 0:23:20| and landscaping plans were sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| They were sent tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| They're not in my plan, or I didn't get them in my package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| They're not in your package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| No, they're not in my package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I think you raised some great points, and I don't feel comfortable at least supporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| Given the information we have, we're getting ready to spend millions of dollars on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Avenue to try to spur private development, and to me, putting a parking lot, to me, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1425)|
| 0:23:55| just doesn't make any sense, and I may need to learn more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1435)|
| 0:24:01| But, you know, just like Councilman Wallace said, in terms of trying to spur development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1441)|
| 0:24:06| you don't want a parking lot along your beautiful new street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| We're talking about an existing parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| Yeah, this is Christy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1453)|
| 0:24:14| It's an existing parking lot that looks really bad now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| So our objective was, number one, we had to find some parking for CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1457)|
| 0:24:22| As I recall, we were required to give up some of our parking for our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| This lot became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| We had FTA funds, which had a timeline on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| They were getting ready to run out, and so our initial thought was, yeah, let's use this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1471)|
| 0:24:36| for a parking lot, but we had the same thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We don't want a parking lot right on Magnolia here at the entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| So what we did is we tried to make it look as nice as we possibly can, and I don't recall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1481)|
| 0:24:47| whether the plan that was sent to you actually has it, but there's going to be a really nice marker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| on that wall, and it will signify the entrance into Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| It's absolutely not our intention to put surface parking lots all the way up and down Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| In fact, we're trying to do just the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1501)|
| 0:25:03| But this was an opportunity that became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| We were in desperate need of parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Don, was there anything else that you wanted to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| But we really did try to think about the fencing and the landscaping and the brick work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1511)|
| 0:25:15| and the hard structure, hardscape structures that could go with the landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1515)|
| 0:25:19| to make it look as nice as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1519)|
| 0:25:21| We were really in desperate need of parking, and this lot became available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| It had an old structure on it that I believe there was no longer any going concern in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1525)|
| 0:25:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Don Disler, Director of Transit, and there's actually a couple of different buildings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| One was housing some old transmission parts and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| The people who were there have been relocated into other businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| or whatever they chose to do, and that's through the FTA grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| The FTA grant was originally gotten, actually this grant was gotten before even I came on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1553)|
| 0:26:01| for this parking lot, and it's actually going to be really cool and really nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| because, as Christy said, it's got landscaping, it's got like an island with trees in the middle of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1567)|
| 0:26:14| It's also going to have one of our brand-new shelters on the outside of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1574)|
| 0:26:19| We're moving our bus stop over, and one of the things that's always requested on Magnolia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| is upgraded passenger amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| We will have shelter as well as benches, trash cans, probably a couple of bike racks even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| This is one of our most highly used bus stops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| This actually, I think it will actually wow everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| because it's not just going to be like an old surface parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| It's actually going to look really nice with the trees, with the bushes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| It will be an entryway that just blows everybody away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| I was actually blown away by seeing it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| It will be secured parking for employees, which is something that they don't have right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| Many of our bus drivers themselves are actually getting on the bus right at this location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| and this allows them the opportunity to park right here, get out of their cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| not have to worry about going inside the buildings or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| They can actually get out of their cars, go get on the bus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| and take the bus down to Knoxville Station where they do a lot of their reliefs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| or over to what will be the Trolley Super Stop where they do a lot of their reliefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| So I really think it's going to wow folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| It's really going to make it look really nice right there in that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| It sounds very well thought out, and a lot of the issues that we've raised have been thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1657)|
| 0:27:44| Would the administration be opposed to postponing it two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| where we could review these beautiful plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| We have a funding issue, so what's our timeline on the funding, Don?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| That one I don't have the answer for right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| I don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Is this two readings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Councilman Gray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| I think part of the problem here is that from what you're saying and from what I hear you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1688)|
| 0:28:14| and what I think it's going to look like is one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| but I think the problem is, and I'm glad George brought this up, is we don't know what we're buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| In other words, we haven't seen it yet, or at least it wasn't in my packet either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| So I think that that's really what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1706)|
| 0:28:29| I think that I have confidence in the administration and all you folks in terms of doing something nice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| because of what we are doing on Magnolia, but we haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| So I would like to see what it does look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| We can wait for two weeks unless there's a funding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| I know we're on a timeline because, again, this is grant money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| This is not money that we necessarily have sitting around, so we are on a timeline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| but we can get you all that information and we can look at it again in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| If there's a problem with that, obviously I'll let you guys know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| I would make a motion we postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| I have a question, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| When the Magnolia, I'll ask it to Don and Michelle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| when the streetscapes plan was presented with the architectural drawings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1751)|
| 0:29:16| was this lot included in that or not at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| It was included at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1761)|
| 0:29:22| It was just a corner lot, but the renderings and the final design was not sought out yet, but now it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1768)|
| 0:29:29| And it would be abutting right on the corner of Magnolia in front of where the barbecue place is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| This is where we're talking about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| It would be located on that corner where the Dixon's Barbecue once stood, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1783)|
| 0:29:45| Okay, so the motion is to postpone two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1785)|
| 0:29:48| We have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1789)|

| 0:30:58| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| I had one question for Joe Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1859)|
| 0:31:03| Will this, for the general public, will they be able to continue to use the recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1863)|
| 0:31:10| center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1870)|

| 0:31:14| Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1874)|
| 0:31:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| In the agreement, there will be hours set aside for public use of the New Hope Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| Center for adult and youth activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1886)|
| 0:31:27| I just want to be sure on that because even right now, I'm getting some pushback about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1887)|
| 0:31:32| the E.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Davison Center and the swimming pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| So, I just want to be clear on that, especially for the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1895)|
| 0:31:41| We feel comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1901)|
| 0:31:42| We've had a good relationship with Emerald at the E.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| Davison Swimming Pool for the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| We were very pleased that they submitted the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| I think Kevin DuBose is here from Emerald and could add more details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| I think they've got a good plan for use of that facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Well, they do an outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| So, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1925)|

| 0:32:16| Organics of Tennessee LLC for the processing of all yard waste collected by the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1945)|
| 0:32:26| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| My law firm, I believe, is representing this company on this contract, so I'll need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1947)|
| 0:32:33| abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1954)|
| 0:32:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1957)|
| 0:32:39| I contacted them today and I asked a question about their minority employees, and they said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| they had zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| And I think we need to start taking a closer look at these contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| I'm not opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| I'm going to vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1974)|
| 0:32:56| But I think we need to take a closer look at these contracts that are being given out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| to companies that have zero minority employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| That's pretty low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| That's pretty low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1987)|
| 0:33:08| That's pretty low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| That's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| Councilman Delivante?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I wonder if Chad Wythe is here or someone, David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| The reason I'd like to have him come to the podium is this is a sort of a change from yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| waste processing from the prior contractor we had, but I understand that it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| save us the city money as well as shorten the lead times for our trucks to get to and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2011)|
| 0:33:39| from this location, because they're actually going to have three locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Maybe Chad can just tell us just a little bit about this program that's going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| on for several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| So we want to know why you picked them and what features stand out to you as a benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| Chad Wythe, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| There are several benefits we found in their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| One of them is having three sites versus one site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| It allows them the ability to have more storage, of course, and what they're proposing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| the downtown site is really just a transfer point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| So we would be taking yard waste to their downtown location, and then they would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| transferring it off that site out to their larger facilities in East Knoxville and West| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2059)|
| 0:34:24| Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2064)|
| 0:34:25| So some things that are positive for the city is we wouldn't be using windrows or actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| the process of mulching would not be at that site or the downtown location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| So that was one of the positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Also, again, just as you mentioned, the ability to have three sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| Some of our trucks are closer to the East Knoxville site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| Some are closer to the West site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| So having three options to take our yard waste is much more helpful from a logistics standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| Are they also donating some mulch to the city to do parks and other things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| Yeah, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Another part of their proposal, and if I could also add that, Barry Marshall and Blake Bryan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| are here, too, the general manager's local contact for Nature's Best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| But that was one thing that they had in their proposal was also kind of a community fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| that they would have that we would manage or somebody would manage for any non-profits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| that need mulch for community projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2115)|
| 0:35:18| That was also a good addition to their proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| In addition, they also have the ability to provide us with playground-grade mulch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| which has a pretty lengthy process to go through if you want to be certified to give playground mulch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| And our current processor doesn't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| So that was another thing that they brought to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2136)|
| 0:35:37| And the final question is environmentally, since we've had issues in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| how did you view that aspect of this proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| Yeah, one of the things that they proposed was also the use of an electric grinder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| which obviously will lower the emissions, especially in the center city of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2147)|
| 0:35:51| They're going to use an electric grinder downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2151)|
| 0:35:54| Instead of diesel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Also, again, because they don't plan on storing a lot of mulch or windrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| or doing the mulch process downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2160)|
| 0:36:03| Environmentally, that takes that issue out of the downtown neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2163)|
| 0:36:07| which I think is a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2167)|
| 0:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2169)|
| 0:36:12| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2173)|
| 0:36:14| The Proctor Street location, the downtown location, is adjacent to Westview neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| and the neighborhood has discussed this, met with David Brace, and is satisfied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| does not have any kind of an issue with this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2185)|
| 0:36:28| So welcome to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| And if I could add to that, too, they've also agreed not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2191)|
| 0:36:34| There is an exit or an entrance on to the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| but they've agreed not to use that only for emergency purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| So we'll have some things in the contract that should provide a good buffer from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2206)|
| 0:36:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2207)|
| 0:36:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2211)|
| 0:36:52| The ayes have it, with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2212)|
| 0:36:55| 11R is a resolution authorized by the mayor to execute an agreement with B&B Lawn Services, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| to install trees at various locations throughout the city during the 2016-2017 tree planting season| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2220)|
| 0:37:06| for $30,000 from the Public Service Department's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| and $20,000 in matching grant funds from the State of Tennessee Division of Forestry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| for a total contract price not to exceed $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2241)|
| 0:37:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| 11S is a resolution approving a tax increment financing amendment to the redevelopment plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| for the Center City Redevelopment Project No. 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation to support the redevelopment of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| located at 322 Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| I'm really excited about this item, but unfortunately my firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| and it's actually not John King this time, it's Robin Askew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| helped represent the owners in making this deal happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2278)|
| 0:38:02| I think everybody hopefully remembers how I felt about this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2282)|
| 0:38:08| and I'm really excited to see that progress is being made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| but unfortunately I'm not able to vote on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| Of course, we're all excited to see good things happen downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| and I guess this is another one of those projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| I have a little bit of heartburn that the TIF is going to extend out 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| I know we had a separate economic firm, Municap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| to evaluate the proposal and the costs and the return to developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| and whether it could be done in some other way, but I certainly have a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2327)|
| 0:38:53| It seems like we defer too long a time for the taxpayers to get benefit from tax on the structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2333)|
| 0:39:01| I realize there are 2,200 square feet of commercial on the lower floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| That should generate both some jobs and some sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| and I certainly understand and approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| I understand they will raise the amount of tax paid a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| I think city and county together will get about $46,000 under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| related to basically covering debt service on the debt the municipality and the county have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2370)|
| 0:39:38| Again, I think it's just the duration of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| We're lucky to have Dover Development doing work on our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| They've done what they've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| They seem to do quality workmanship, and so I don't quarrel with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| I scratch my head a bit and wonder why it isn't easier to knock the building down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| and build a nice new building in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2396)|
| 0:39:59| I know Marshall waxes elegant on historic structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| but that garage is basically a brick box that has an extensive amount of rehab to do to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2403)|
| 0:40:11| It doesn't seem to have any extraordinary architectural features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2411)|
| 0:40:15| But that said, I guess we're moving the ball forward in terms of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2415)|
| 0:40:21| and people living in downtown, so in that sense I do support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2421)|
| 0:40:27| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| Was that a question, Mr. Garbo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| No, that was a comment on why we are extending these out so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| I also want the public to understand he's a lawyer and not an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| so therefore may not have an understanding of the aesthetics of certain buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2438)|
| 0:40:42| Don and Michelle, we tried to get in touch with each other for the last three or four days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| One of the questions I had, and one of the questions is the 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| but explain to me that this is a condominium project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2452)|
| 0:40:57| and so the condos are going to be sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| so how does all this taxing work on this in terms of the development of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| and the TIF and then selling the condos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| How does this all tie together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| I'm a little confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2472)|
| 0:41:13| Maybe Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| Sure, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| This really is typical of how we do tax-exempt financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| It works better when there is actually a sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| So the taxes will be paid in full by whoever ends up in the condominiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| and then those taxes will, the major portion of them that's not for debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2488)|
| 0:41:34| will go to retire the TIF loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2494)|
| 0:41:37| So the actual, once the taxing financing strategy assumes a sale, it works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2497)|
| 0:41:43| Otherwise, if the building were being retained and rented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| a payment in lieu of taxes works better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2506)|
| 0:41:49| So I buy a condo, and I have taxes to pay to both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| But those taxes are actually going towards the TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2515)|
| 0:41:58| They're going towards the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| They're going towards the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| That is, the owner of, for instance, people in the Holston right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| or the Burwell or some others, they have no idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2524)|
| 0:42:06| would have no reason to have any idea that they are, in fact, in a TIF project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| They get their taxes, pay them in full to city and county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| and then as part of the process, those are diverted through KCDC to repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| to retire the TIF loan, and it's up to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| That's a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| In many cases, we have every reason to believe that it would be retired sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| That would be sort of a set of most conservative conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| stretches it and says if it's not paid in 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| then the burden falls back on the bank and the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| Well, I think there's several reasons why this is a very unique project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| and why it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| I wanted to address Nick's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| One of the reasons this one takes so long is the value of that property is already high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2571)|
| 0:42:56| and you're doing a $10 million total project, but it's already appraised at a high value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| so the difference of what they're getting, it takes 30 years to pay back $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2581)|
| 0:43:08| So it's a long time, but the differential of where it is today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| and where it's going is not as great as we've seen some of the other projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| that have shorter TIFs, even for greater money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| I think there's great value in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| That's why it's selling, and that is the significance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| because there's tremendous value in that as opposed to the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So there's no doubt about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| I think the other thing that's unique about this property is it is the best located property in downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2611)|
| 0:43:42| It is the prime property in downtown Knoxville that nobody else has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| And you're going to see the high cost of the condos are going to be really high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2630)|
| 0:43:54| I mean, they start at $500,000, so that's a pretty big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| I think probably the last thing that makes this project unique is the owners putting in, with no debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2639)|
| 0:44:07| the total value of the property as it is today, including the structure and the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2647)|
| 0:44:11| You don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Of all the TIFs we've done, none of them have had the amount of equity that this project has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| So it's very unique, and I think that it's very well worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| It saves a historic structure, which is important, but it continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| You take blight, and then you're going to put a really nice project on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| So it's very unique.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| I think the TIFs warrant it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2677)|
| 0:44:38| I think the UNICAP made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| You saw that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2680)|
| 0:44:41| They were able to do math that we're not able to do and determine what the rate of return would be for the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| We have not seen that before, and certainly no third party has evaluated that like they have on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2687)|
| 0:44:57| and it certainly gives me a lot more confidence knowing that third parties have looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2697)|
| 0:45:01| They're not trying to deny it, but they're also not trying to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| and I think it gives us all a great amount of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| So I look forward to supporting the development on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2709)|
| 0:45:16| Yeah, I appreciate your comments, but I think there's two things that still stand true,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2716)|
| 0:45:22| and that is I seriously doubt anyone's going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| honey, let's get in the car and drive to Knoxville to see the second oldest garage in America.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| Who cares?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2730)|
| 0:45:31| I mean, it's a nice box, and it's going to be nice condos, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| but it's not the kind of historic structure like the Farragut Hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| or some of those other buildings that really had a wow factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| The second thing is while you mentioned the equity being put in along with both cash equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2744)|
| 0:45:51| and the real property, the owner of the real property is going to benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| because the rest of his track is going to benefit greatly from the improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| so I think they have a big incentive to get this project going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| There's nothing against that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| I'm not against the profit motive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| I think it's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| I just, for the life of me, can't figure out why another marble alley on that block isn't a better solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2767)|
| 0:46:14| but that isn't the one in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2774)|
| 0:46:16| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| I appreciate your explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=2779)|

| 0:50:42| the Planning Commission on May the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| You're 96 or 97 days into the process, so I don't know if another postponement at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3044)|

| 0:50:57| That was a question that was raised earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| In 2008, Mr. Farrell brought the property forward for rezoning at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3062)|

| 0:51:23| The Planning Commission recommended OB, which is similar to the O-1, present O-1 zone, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| the conditions, the four conditions that are in place that were put on the property at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3091)|
| 0:51:38| that time, along with the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| The property was subsequently annexed later in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Again, the issue with regard to whether it should be C-6 or O-1, going through the annexation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3105)|
| 0:51:51| rezoning process, was discussed at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| Council approved O-1 in May of 2008, again, including the four conditions that were included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3115)|
| 0:52:05| previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| Mr. Farrell has now come before you with another rezoning request from O-1 to C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3128)|
| 0:52:15| The Planning Commission, after much discussion by Mr. Farrell and the area residents, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| Planning Commission voted by 9-5 to recommend approval of the change of the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| the one-year plan amendment, and the rezoning to C-6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3149)|
| 0:52:33| The record would reflect that there was some discussion as to whether the discussion in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3153)|
| 0:52:42| favor of the rezoning more or less revolved around the idea that it should not be split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3162)|
| 0:52:48| zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3168)|
| 0:52:49| A portion of the property is zoned C-6 and a portion of it is zoned O-1, and the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| reflects that there was some angst about having it that way, and so they voted to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3174)|
| 0:53:02| the resolutions and recommend to you the approval as requested by Mr. Farrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| Mayor, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Yeah, I just wanted to ask Dan, since he's been speaking to this, the reason that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| staff put O-1 on the part of the parcel that's not on Parkside Drive but on the back end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| near Cogdill Road was to protect the neighborhood surrounding that property, and it was a transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| zone, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3210)|
| 0:53:31| Office is often a transition zone from commercial to residential, and that was a kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3211)|
| 0:53:37| protective barrier, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| Would you comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3219)|
| 0:53:40| That is correct, and these are two different, or were at that time, two different pieces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| The property fronting on Parkside Drive was one parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3226)|
| 0:53:50| The property that was back on Cogdill was a separate parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| It adjoins, as a matter of fact, had a dwelling on the property itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| I don't know if that house is still there or not, but it did have a house on it at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| There are houses immediately adjacent to it to the south and also across the street to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3245)|
| 0:54:11| the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3252)|
| 0:54:15| Councilman, Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3255)|
| 0:54:17| Dan, it was also my understanding, and maybe the residents and Mr. Farrell can address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3257)|
| 0:54:23| this, but at the time of the rezoning of the piece of property, the one that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| talking about, wasn't there an agreement at that time with the community or with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3268)|
| 0:54:34| those four conditions that were talked about in 2008 and they're still on the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3279)|
| 0:54:40| There's information in the record that Mr. Farrell's representative at that time agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| to the conditions as stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| And the two pieces of property, even though it is sort of unusual, you can have a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| of property that has two different zones on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| Most certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| It can happen for numerous reasons, and this is one reason in particular to try to establish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| buffers from more intense uses back into residential areas, things such as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| And the staff's recommendation, as Mr. DelVolpe was saying, was really to protect the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| in other words, use this as a buffer so that the neighborhood can be protected from further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| encroachment of any kind of commercial use, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| It was to give the neighborhood some protection, yes, and it's also believed that the O1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3330)|
| 0:55:36| would give Mr. Farrell reasonable use of his property also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| I was going to say that was my other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| He still has reasonable use of his property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3341)|
| 0:55:43| We believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| I think there's some other folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Right, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| Councilman Wallace, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3351)|
| 0:55:52| Well, Dan, what kind of setback differences are there from C6 to O1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3352)|
| 0:55:58| So if he's got O1, what kind of setbacks would he be facing, and would that be any different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3358)|
| 0:56:02| if it was C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3362)|
| 0:56:04| I guess it's a good thing I looked that up this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| C6 requires a 60-foot setback adjoining residential, and the O1 has a 30-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3369)|
| 0:56:16| The condition as approved, though, was for a 60-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| A 60-foot buffer, even on the office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| That's part of the condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3387)|
| 0:56:28| That is part of the condition, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| Okay, so, Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| I was going to say, are we going to hear from anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Well, we're going to ask, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3398)|
| 0:56:39| So we have two people signed up against, but typically we allow those who are for it to speak first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| and then those who are against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| So, Mr. Furrow, are you speaking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| And you can have up to three people for up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3409)|
| 0:56:52| Is it just you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3412)|
| 0:56:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| I'm Sam Furrow, 5300 Turtle Point Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3417)|
| 0:57:02| These circumstances, I suppose my witness the other day was, I don't remember, 2008 rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3422)|
| 0:57:11| but irrespective, that was done because the mayor at the time, I guess, I don't know who it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3431)|
| 0:57:18| took this property, both pieces of this property are in the city, after it was annexed by Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| So as a result, the county zoning wasn't a problem to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| The issues as to how I utilize the property are greatly impacted by the manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3452)|
| 0:57:38| I just can't go out and build something the way that it makes sense under some ordinance or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3458)|
| 0:57:45| So we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| But the fact that it has been there and in our possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| trying to figure out how to protect the neighborhood and ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| has basically delayed me a year or two just because I didn't want to get into the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3479)|
| 0:58:04| But now that we're there, I think that the issue is, is the handicap to the neighbors equal or greater with the progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3484)|
| 0:58:16| And hopefully what I'm going to do, then, if we don't, because you're right, I can use the 01.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| I can build an office building, I think, and I can build a car lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| I can build anything in C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3506)|
| 0:58:28| So they will never have a greater opportunity, in my opinion, to impact the setbacks, the shrubbery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3508)|
| 0:58:40| and all the things that they have expressed to me that they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3520)|
| 0:58:45| And the risk to them is that I won't do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3525)|
| 0:58:50| but the benefits to them are that it will be done right if I do what I say I'll do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| and it will minimize those issues that I think you're going to hear them express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3537)|
| 0:59:02| We met last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3542)|
| 0:59:03| Everybody was very cordial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3543)|
| 0:59:05| We discussed in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| I understand their objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| I've tried to figure out how to accommodate each of the objections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3548)|
| 0:59:12| So I guess I would ask for them to express to you all how they feel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| and then let me give you my response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Okay, now Steve McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3563)|
| 0:59:27| Sir, you have up to five minutes, and state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3571)|
| 0:59:32| My name is Steve McGee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I live at 118 Land Oak Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3573)|
| 0:59:39| I've lived in this neighborhood for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| I've owned two houses there, one on Cogdill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| Then ten years ago I bought another house on Land Oak and sold the one on Cogdill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| I love this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3593)|
| 0:59:54| We have about 91 homes, and during the 40 years I've been there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| we have had a lot of commercial encroachment on our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| When I first moved there, my neighbor had horses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| But that's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3608)|
| 1:00:11| We haven't been against progress, development, and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| We just would like some kind of little buffer between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| We've always talked about it in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| We feel that office is a good buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3625)|
| 1:00:28| There's other properties close to this one, right across from Cogdill Road, that are office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| They came to us earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| They wanted to be C6, and we were able to hold them to office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| I think in this case, if this goes C6, it'll set a precedence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3643)|
| 1:00:48| The other people could come back and say, you know, that went C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| We would like C6 also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3653)|
| 1:00:56| We can get along with business if it is office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| On my old house on Cogdill Road, there was an office behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3661)|
| 1:01:05| Some of the best neighbors I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3665)|
| 1:01:07| Not that Sam wouldn't be a good neighbor, but offices traditionally are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| My house now backs up to the Landoak office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Again, good neighbors there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| It's like nobody's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| They're 9 to 5 or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| It's not a lot of traffic on the lot, people out talking, looking around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3681)|
| 1:01:26| Also, we feel that C6 would hurt the values of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3686)|
| 1:01:33| When 91 people, even though I don't live right there touching it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3693)|
| 1:01:39| if the value of their house goes down, mine's a comp, it will go down too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3699)|
| 1:01:44| Also with this, a car lot, one of the lots there, it shows 11 on the map, is affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3704)|
| 1:01:50| It's going to be on three sides, his complete side yard and the backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3710)|
| 1:01:56| He's almost surrounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| This was brought up, I think, in 2008 when it was brought up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| The neighborhood kind of agreed at that time we would be okay with an office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3724)|
| 1:02:11| That would be a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3731)|
| 1:02:15| We don't know what's changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| We're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3738)|
| 1:02:20| Originally, we'd like for it to be residential, but we know times have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| We are okay with office, with all the conditions that are on there now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| and we would like to stick with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| Now, Chris Barton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| I'd like to recognize the neighborhood that's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3759)|
| 1:02:42| If the people could stand up, it's just part of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3766)|
| 1:02:49| Chris Barton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| Mr. Barton, please state your name and address for the record, and you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3772)|
| 1:02:56| My name is Chris Barton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| I live at 329 Landoak Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| My wife and I have been residents in Landoak's area for 10 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| We live at the end of Alex Lane and Landoak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Several of the properties that are right next to us are going to be greatly impacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3789)|
| 1:03:16| if changes happen within the zoning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| Again, Steve covered this very well as far as our concern is for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3801)|
| 1:03:30| The neighborhood is a hidden treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3810)|
| 1:03:33| It's located right off of Kingston Pike, and most people don't even know that it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| These are nice homes that are well taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| We've seen a turnover in the neighborhood where we've had local residents that were there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3822)|
| 1:03:47| that built their homes there originally back in the late 50s and early 60s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3827)|
| 1:03:52| New families are moving in that have young children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| and so we would like to see that the neighborhood has a way to preserve itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3835)|
| 1:04:01| and by keeping the recommendations that MPC made in 2008, that would allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3841)|
| 1:04:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3849)|
| 1:04:10| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3850)|
| 1:04:11| So, Mr. Farrell, by council rules, I can't allow you to come back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3851)|
| 1:04:15| but now council will start to discuss, and they might ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| or any of the speakers additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| Doesn't he get too many rebuttals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| No, this is an administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| I checked with the law director, so typically it's for and against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| but they may call to ask questions of any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| I don't know how many of my colleagues went out to see this particular neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| In fact, as the gentleman said, it was hard to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3878)|
| 1:04:41| I had a difficult time finding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| But it's an isolated little neighborhood that's completely surrounded by commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| and it's much like some of the other neighborhoods that we have where we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3888)|
| 1:04:52| you know, for instance, West Hills, for instance, has Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| and it has Middlebrook Pike, and it has the commercial around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| And if you drive through the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| you'll find that it's a very well-kept, very well-maintained neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| And if my colleagues will remember, I think it was four weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| or maybe six weeks ago we had a similar situation on Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3908)|
| 1:05:12| where we had the R1 where the car dealership wanted to expand into that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3912)|
| 1:05:17| and the neighborhood was concerned about that piece of property changing over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3917)|
| 1:05:22| And, of course, the difference there, too, is that we actually had a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| that separated that particular lot from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| In this particular situation, we have a particular lot that adjoins the property there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| And the concern that I have, and especially after going through the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3935)|
| 1:05:38| and talking to the neighbors, is that is this a beginning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3938)|
| 1:05:41| In other words, once we encroach into the property, then what's to stop the rest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| If you go down Cogdell Road, you'll notice that those houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| especially on what would be the west side, have commercial or office zoning all behind them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3949)|
| 1:05:56| but they do have that buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| And so the neighborhood has a buffer that surrounds it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3958)|
| 1:06:01| And it's one thing that I think that we need to realize that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3961)|
| 1:06:05| when you get down to zoning, you have to draw a line somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3965)|
| 1:06:09| And a line was drawn in 2008, and an agreement was made in terms of what could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| And I've known Mr. Furrell for years, and I know that he'll do a good job at whatever he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| And we're not really disallowing him from using his piece of property to put the office building on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| So he can still have his office building located on that piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| He can have his service and the car lot on the C6 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3990)|
| 1:06:35| And so I would think that we just really need to think about the negative kind of impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=3995)|
| 1:06:41| that the potential of this has on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| as well as what could happen in the future with the rest of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4004)|
| 1:06:48| So I ask that you all consider that very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| I also ask that you consider what we did a few weeks ago with the Clinton Highway property also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4019)|
| 1:07:00| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4020)|
| 1:07:01| Well, what makes this one a little bit unique,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| as opposed to the one that you referenced that we had a few weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| is that the commercial properties face Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4029)|
| 1:07:13| So in this case, there's no access on Cognell Road to Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4033)|
| 1:07:18| That's a permanent closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| That doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| The other properties along Parkside Drive where the hotel is, it has access out to Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| It doesn't have access back to Cognell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| So there's no commercial activity on Cognell Road, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| So it's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| I mean, all of it comes off of Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| It would have a Parkside Drive access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4061)|
| 1:07:43| That was part of our problem in finding it, Mr. Greave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| and I put in Cognell Road, and that led me on a little bit of an excursion, shall we say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| But you did get to see the neighborhood, so that was a good part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4073)|
| 1:07:56| I didn't realize where we were getting to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| I guess my questions are to Mr. Furrah about the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4078)|
| 1:08:03| and have you submitted a landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| and have you submitted what your site plan would look like and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4085)|
| 1:08:12| Well, again, it's so fluid, the actual site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4092)|
| 1:08:16| But we'll not only verbalize, but I think what was the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| there are regulations that determine how much foliage you're supposed to have and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| I can assure you I don't want to see the residential part of it, and they don't want to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4108)|
| 1:08:33| And so I'm going to put hedges in there that won't be seen one to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| And so that visual part of it is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| Something that you need to understand is that every house in that subdivision except this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4121)|
| 1:08:48| has a deed restriction against this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| Do you understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| So as a result, that was why I bought this one house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4132)|
| 1:08:56| and that's why the city, I guess, when they bought it, they came around with their property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| So it's a truly unique piece of property compared to the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| I concur with everything you said about the neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| I'm not trying to hurt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| I'm going to help it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4151)|
| 1:09:12| And if this doesn't happen, and if I can't put a Land Rover store in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4152)|
| 1:09:18| I don't know what's going to happen to the C6 piece because if I can't use it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4158)|
| 1:09:21| we've got to put in somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4161)|
| 1:09:23| I'm going to sell it to somebody for something, and it could be whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4163)|
| 1:09:26| and they're not going to care about the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| And that's why I keep trying to explain to them is that this is not going to be the worst thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| that could possibly come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| It might be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4176)|
| 1:09:40| Did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4180)|
| 1:09:41| Yeah, I think so, and I think it's probably the lack of having an actual site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4181)|
| 1:09:47| and something physical to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| I mean, would it be possible to produce a landscape plan and a site plan within two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4189)|
| 1:09:55| Well, we have some assurances that, I mean, you've got a 60-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| I mean, we're already required to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4199)|
| 1:10:01| There's four properties that adjoin it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4201)|
| 1:10:03| I mean, we're going to benefit from a 60-foot buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4203)|
| 1:10:05| I guess if I had some assurances of what that 60-foot buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| how it was going to be planted on size of plants and spacing and so forth and so on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| it would give me greater comfort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| I assume also that Land Rover's probably got some of their own restrictions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4216)|
| 1:10:20| and expectations of you for that property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| I don't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Well, not necessarily for landscaping, but it would for a lot of stuff, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4227)|
| 1:10:28| So I think if I had that, I mean, I would feel, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| I would try to get a little more comfortable to address the restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| The thickest hedge that you can imagine that you couldn't see on the other side of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4233)|
| 1:10:36| I'd commit that to you right now because that's basically where we're going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| But I'll be happy to do that if two weeks helps anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4245)|
| 1:10:46| But, Dan, you say we don't have time to postpone it two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4246)|
| 1:10:51| Well, this is day 96 or 97, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| So you've got 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4255)|
| 1:10:57| So they could postpone it for two weeks and come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| but then if they passed it, they'd have to pass it on emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| because in 14 days they're going to be too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| But I think they could still postpone it one time if they were in agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4267)|
| 1:11:12| that if it comes back and they're going to adopt something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| they're going to adopt it on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| That's a potential solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4280)|
| 1:11:21| Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4281)|
| 1:11:22| Yeah, I'm just curious, Mr. Farrell, what happens to the dealership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| I mean, if this doesn't go, if you can't go forward with it, then what's the ultimate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| We'll have to find someplace else, and I honestly don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| Bobby Goodfriend has some land on down, but I don't know if I can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| These are 2008 prices, and Bobby's 2016, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| But the answer is we have less than two acres there, and we've just grown exponentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4302)|
| 1:11:48| and it's just outgrown our ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| I was just curious about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| And then going back to what Vice Mayor Grieve brought up about that other dealership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4313)|
| 1:11:57| but, you know, there was a willingness with the dealership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| and Mr. Seymour to meet with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| and this majority of the council went ahead and voted it without them even getting an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4325)|
| 1:12:13| to sit down at the table, which I think is, you know, I didn't agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4333)|
| 1:12:19| You know, I was in the minority there as opposed to Mr. Farrell has met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4339)|
| 1:12:24| So, I mean, you reference that, but it's two different cases totally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| I don't ever remember us not giving the ability for a neighborhood and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4349)|
| 1:12:34| the two opposing parties to come together and try to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| The majority of council just went ahead and decided it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| So I don't think that's, you know, the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| So that also one thing that I can give you assurances of, and the gentleman was very accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4364)|
| 1:12:49| he was concerned about the adjoining property just up the park side from us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| where the office buildings are that they may come in and ask for C6 zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4374)|
| 1:13:00| And that's owned by the Phillips family, Teddy Phillips and Lamar Shuler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| They both have given me their personal authority to say to you they have absolutely no interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4385)|
| 1:13:10| or ever will to go to C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| They're building a 73,000 square foot office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4392)|
| 1:13:15| They're starting this week, you engineering people may know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| So as a result, that's off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| So if that was ever a threat to the neighborhood, it's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4407)|
| 1:13:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| I guess this is for Mr. Kelly, and then, Mr. Farrell, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4409)|
| 1:13:33| You said that a C6 has a 60-foot buffer, vegetation buffer of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4413)|
| 1:13:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4418)|
| 1:13:39| A 60-foot building setback from residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| Okay, and an O1 has 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| And in the MPC restrictions that came with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4426)|
| 1:13:50| I think you had to have 60 feet of vegetation type buffer of some sort?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4430)|
| 1:13:55| No, it says establish a rear building setback of 60 feet adjacent to residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4435)|
| 1:14:02| and install a type A dense landscape screen along the entire length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| That doesn't mean 60 feet of dense landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| but it does require that the buildings be set back a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| My understanding was it was 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4455)|
| 1:14:18| I don't know if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| That's approximately right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I think it was 15 feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| 15 to 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| But you don't want to look at the houses, and they don't want to look at you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4462)|
| 1:14:26| so there should be some kind of vegetation that would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| and create even a little forest or woodsy type area that is currently not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4470)|
| 1:14:36| The specs are in the zoning, but I intend to do better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| Because you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4481)|
| 1:14:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Mr. Farrell, I want to ask you, you talked about the visual and putting the hedge there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| What about the noise or lighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4493)|
| 1:14:56| Have you all talked about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| Those were very prominent issues that these folks discussed, and this is our answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| Number one, the noise, I hate to admit it, but around a car dealership is basically contained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4504)|
| 1:15:09| You don't hear, you know, we're not out there banging and beating and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4509)|
| 1:15:13| It's not a disassembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4513)|
| 1:15:14| It's a replacement issue anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| So the noise factor, I think, is absolutely minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4517)|
| 1:15:22| The lighting factor is a legitimate concern, but with today's lighting and all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| our intent is to keep it away, not in any direction toward them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| turn it off at 10 o'clock at night or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| We can easily do that except for the security, the small security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4534)|
| 1:15:38| But whatever happens, if we don't do this, if I don't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| somebody's going to do it 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 15 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| So everything that we're going to do, I can't cure, even though it's a legitimate concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4546)|
| 1:15:52| But for those four people that are joining us there, I've got to admit, it's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| I don't think that we can turn those lights in any way that will harm them, but I can't guarantee it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| And I also state I went down to look at the neighborhood, and I also got a little bit lost, but I did find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4564)|
| 1:16:11| So thank you for your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4571)|
| 1:16:14| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4575)|
| 1:16:16| Actually, I had the same question that Mayor Brown had, and that was about the lights and the noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4576)|
| 1:16:22| specifically, because the dealers I'm aware of, they have loudspeakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| and they're calling for people in the lot and all this stuff, and you can hear them from a good distance away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| No more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| We have speakers inside the building, but they don't go outside the building and create noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4595)|
| 1:16:42| And there's no, I mean, other than traffic, an office wouldn't be any worse or any better than what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4602)|
| 1:16:49| As the neighbor said, the office often shut down at 5 or 6 o'clock and go home, and that's a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4609)|
| 1:16:57| That's a huge difference because you retail something that's going to be open until 8 or 9 or 10 o'clock or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4617)|
| 1:17:03| and then turn the lights off and the noise off and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| I agree with Councilman Wallace that if we can see a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4627)|
| 1:17:14| and I would hope it would be shared with the neighbors as well, that that might help the discussion along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4634)|
| 1:17:21| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4641)|
| 1:17:22| I would make it subject to their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| Yeah, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4647)|
| 1:17:29| The one thing that's missing here, at least in the discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| is that despite the fact that Mr. Farrow has good intentions and will probably follow through with what he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4652)|
| 1:17:38| I assume he's an honorable person and can build it the way he's talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4658)|
| 1:17:43| this is a piece of property we're zoning and he can turn around next year and decide there ain't no reason to have land rose over business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4663)|
| 1:17:50| sell it off, and someone else can do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4670)|
| 1:17:53| We are zoning the land and there will be grandfathered rights in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4673)|
| 1:17:58| and we have to at least consider that because his good layout might be something that's erased by the next owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4678)|
| 1:18:04| and so don't ignore that factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4687)|
| 1:18:11| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4691)|
| 1:18:12| Okay, so I'm going to make a motion that we, and there's two ways we could do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4692)|
| 1:18:16| We could postpone it for two weeks and have him come back with a site plan and a landscape plan, a lighting plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4696)|
| 1:18:23| or we can approve it tonight subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| And then it's either going to be read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4706)|
| 1:18:29| If that were to succeed, it would be read on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4709)|
| 1:18:32| Are you comfortable, Mr. Swanson, with a motion that says that we would approve this subject to lighting plan, site plan, and landscape plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4712)|
| 1:18:45| Sure, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| You would have to satisfy yourself before the next reading that that plan is satisfactory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| and if it's not, then don't pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| Okay, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4732)|
| 1:18:53| That's what I intended to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4733)|
| 1:18:55| If it either didn't produce it or it wasn't satisfactory or we couldn't come to an agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4735)|
| 1:19:00| then we wouldn't pass it on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| So I make a motion we approve the zoning as requested subject to Mr. Furrow producing a landscape plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| a site plan, and a lighting plan that show the direction and the intensity of the lighting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4755)|
| 1:19:17| Okay, discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4760)|
| 1:19:21| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4761)|
| 1:19:22| Just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4762)|
| 1:19:23| I'm not comfortable yet with voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| I could not support that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| I want to see this before we get into it, even though I know we could turn it down on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4771)|
| 1:19:36| All right, so we turn it down on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| If he doesn't approve it, then we didn't produce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| Yeah, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| I'm just not comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4781)|
| 1:19:45| Vice Mayor Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| Can I make a friendly amendment that we postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| Postpone for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4792)|
| 1:19:53| Because I think in postponing it for two weeks, we know that we have to act on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4793)|
| 1:19:58| And if we pass it the first time, and I know that Mr. Furrow has met with the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4798)|
| 1:20:03| and the neighbors have met with them, and they have a good relationship and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4803)|
| 1:20:06| but I think that what I'd like to see, you know, being in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| I'd like to see it postponed for two weeks and then go into emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4809)|
| 1:20:13| So that's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4813)|
| 1:20:14| You can make that if you get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| Okay, so the motion now is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4818)|
| 1:20:21| Postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4821)|
| 1:20:24| Okay, discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| With the intent of getting those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| I mean, I think that's what we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| A complete landscape plan, show spacing, size, all that, site plan, showing the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4831)|
| 1:20:38| We want to see where the buildings are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4838)|
| 1:20:39| And then a lighting plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| I think we want to see where the lighting, you know, what the direction of the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4840)|
| 1:20:44| So I'm agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| Okay, saying we get to put the architect to work quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| Is that good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4849)|
| 1:20:51| No, I'm not the architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| Sam, make sure they understand this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4854)|

| 1:21:23| And then you'll have to pass it on emergency if you pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=4883)|

| 1:26:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5191)|
| 1:26:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5192)|
| 1:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| So, did we have a motion and a second or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5194)|
| 1:26:38| We have a motion, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5198)|
| 1:26:39| Yeah, I want to call on him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| So, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| It's in the next district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5205)|
| 1:26:46| I'll let him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5206)|
| 1:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5207)|
| 1:26:48| Yeah, I wanted to ask Dan Kelly a question because the staff came out in favor of O1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5208)|
| 1:26:54| Would you tell us how that affects the intended use with, I think Mr. Seymour said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| four public auctions or thereabouts, a small number per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5220)|
| 1:27:04| Can that be done under O1, or is that a restriction that prohibits the use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| the only use he's buying it for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5229)|
| 1:27:11| I guess he wants to store furniture and sell it periodically, from what I heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5231)|
| 1:27:15| part of it online and part of it in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5235)|
| 1:27:20| Dan Kelly, MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| The chief billing official has determined that an auction house could not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5241)|
| 1:27:27| or is not a permitted use in the O1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5247)|
| 1:27:30| They have made the conclusion that C4 zoning is the zone that they need in order to be able to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5250)|
| 1:27:41| The history on this, if you recall, this matter came before you a month or so ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5261)|
| 1:27:48| It came to the Planning Commission in April with a request for C3 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| The Planning Commission recommended O1, got to council after the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5274)|
| 1:27:59| You remanded the matter back to MPC to consider C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5279)|
| 1:28:04| We did so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| The Planning Commission, again, is recommending O1 be your number one action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5286)|
| 1:28:13| If you believe that you want to approve the C4 as requested now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5293)|
| 1:28:21| we did add to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5301)|
| 1:28:23| did discuss some conditions that they would like to have added to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5303)|
| 1:28:28| if you are going to approve the C4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5308)|
| 1:28:32| And that's the landscaping and the same one access point and that type of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5312)|
| 1:28:38| the use of the main building rather than the property, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| The use of the main building for commercial, the only building to be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5322)|
| 1:28:46| no additional access, and a type B landscape screen must be installed around the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| The Planning Commission, in making the recommendation for O1, looked at the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5333)|
| 1:28:59| This is an old school building that's been out there for many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5339)|
| 1:29:05| If you look at the map, it looks very, the proximity to this property to other commercial zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5345)|
| 1:29:11| it looks like it would be a no-brainer to approve commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5351)|
| 1:29:16| But, however, due to the access to the property off of Asheville Highway onto Old Ruggles Ferry Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5356)|
| 1:29:24| there's a fairly steep grade that you go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5364)|
| 1:29:27| so it actually is separated from that Asheville Highway frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| that you don't have that feel of being on the frontage when you're back in this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| That's why the Planning Commission continues to recommend O1 zoning for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| All right, but the fact that it doesn't have direct frontage on Asheville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5379)|
| 1:29:43| means a traditional commercial business really can't survive there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| If you can't see them, you can't go to them, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5387)|
| 1:29:50| and people don't go to an auction by driving and saying, ooh, there's an auction, let's go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| I mean, it's sort of an invited and advertised event where people come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| and they have an auctioneer and they go through whatever list of products there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5399)|
| 1:30:06| As I understand it, this building is sort of a match to the use that the buyer wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| and, of course, the American Legion wants to get closer downtown, as I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5412)|
| 1:30:17| They wanted to leave the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5417)|
| 1:30:18| They've moved their tank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| And I thought you all were putting a type of screening that would shield that one house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| or maybe there are two houses that you can see there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5426)|
| 1:30:29| that you would not want to have them participate in the visual of what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| but that was a condition that you thought would make the use more acceptable if it went C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| And, again, the property is being zoned C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| and C4 is a commercial zoning district which allows a broad range of commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5447)|
| 1:30:53| And the Planning Commission, in its consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5453)|
| 1:30:56| asked Steve Wise, the MPC's attorney, if they can condition the use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5456)|
| 1:31:04| And I believe that Mr. Swanson and Mr. Wise have discussed this matter a number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| with regard to you can't condition the particular use of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5470)|
| 1:31:14| So, therefore, they came up with these conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5474)|
| 1:31:19| but at the same time recognize that C4 zoning is going to be placed on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| and any use permitted in the C4 zone will be allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5493)|
| 1:31:35| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| This is what we asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| It came up and we sent it back and we're back with a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5502)|
| 1:31:48| You have a good buyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5508)|
| 1:31:49| This is an old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| Certainly, I presume it has some historic value out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5511)|
| 1:31:55| I assume Mr. Coker is going to rehab the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5515)|
| 1:32:00| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5520)|
| 1:32:01| Can I ask that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5521)|
| 1:32:02| I mean, it needs quite a bit of exterior work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| I didn't go inside, but drove out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| Actually, it's just going to need a good cleanup on the exterior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5526)|
| 1:32:09| It's brick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5529)|
| 1:32:10| And from my standpoint, the windows are already bricked up, which is a security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| Burglars can't get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| Of course, it will be secured with cameras, burglar alarms, and all like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5536)|
| 1:32:21| But as far as the brick is concerned, cleaning it, painting it up, and landscaping it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5541)|
| 1:32:27| So I make a motion that we substitute motion that we allow C4 on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| I think this would be a motion to amend to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| With the conditions that have been already stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| We're fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| Mr. Coker, could you please state your address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| 508 Union Avenue, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| So did we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5576)|
| 1:32:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5581)|
| 1:33:02| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| I'm really like Councilman Talafope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5587)|
| 1:33:10| I have some real heartburn on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| And this kind of begs this whole thing about us looking at our zoning codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| Here we are with a situation that if we do C4 on this, then yes, we may ask for these conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5599)|
| 1:33:28| which may or may not be enforceable as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| And it kind of worries me where we're going because this thing is turning over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| It can turn over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| It's the same thing we were just facing ten minutes ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| This really worries me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5621)|
| 1:33:43| I'm really conflicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| Let me throw out an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| You've got an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5628)|
| 1:33:49| I mean, if you want to protect it from being torn down, if you want it as an option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5629)|
| 1:33:54| you can ask Mr. Coker if he's agreeable to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| I mean, you could ask the NPC to consider an H1 overlay on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| and then that would prevent it from being torn down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| It sits so high above the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| If you went out there, the elevation is so high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| And you're kind of back off of it with the trees in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| And property that you don't own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| So the property that actually, you know, I mean, the trees that are in front of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| that are actually on Asheville Highway are not on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| which you couldn't cut the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| So visibility, it doesn't lend itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| But it is one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5663)|
| 1:34:25| If you want a protective structure and protect it a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| then you could ask him if he was agreeable to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| and you'd have to send it back to the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5671)|
| 1:34:33| But that's another option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Before I do that, let me listen to some other questions and discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5675)|
| 1:34:39| Well, I mean, that's a huge ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5679)|
| 1:34:44| And I don't know that it's an inappropriate ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| But to ask him to agree to that right here and now is just not, I mean, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5686)|
| 1:34:53| we just, as much as I don't want to, we'd have to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| I just wouldn't ask anybody to make that big a decision on the spot without being to confer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5696)|
| 1:35:05| That's just a huge ask, and I couldn't go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| Councilwoman Foner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5712)|
| 1:35:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| Councilman Saunders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5714)|
| 1:35:15| you brought up the fact that we know our zoning measures need serious attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5715)|
| 1:35:22| But until we have that attention and something before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| we really need to go with what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| And I think it's unfair to applicants to go through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5728)|
| 1:35:33| and then get to us and we say, oh, well, we're going to wait until,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| or I'd like to wait or I'd like to think about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| I understand that zoning goes with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5739)|
| 1:35:43| and that when Mr. Coker no longer owns that property or is no longer using it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| something else could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| But this happens on everything that we zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| I'm not asking to wait at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| I'm just really conflicted on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| The office I'm very comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| When we start going C4, then my comfort level decreases enormously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5761)|
| 1:36:08| No, I think that office may fit MPC's plan in the little book of things to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5768)|
| 1:36:16| but practically speaking, an office at this site is not reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5776)|
| 1:36:21| I don't see that this would be a place that some company would put an office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5781)|
| 1:36:27| a group of lawyers, a group of accountants, other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| I just don't see that this being, would be used as an office site ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| Councilman DelVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Yeah, I just wanted to add to what you said, Councilwoman Palmer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5799)|
| 1:36:45| and that is that this building is valued for its size and its security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5805)|
| 1:36:52| In terms of visibility to the marketplace on Asheville Highway, it has none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5812)|
| 1:36:58| You can drive past this little road and miss it and not even see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5818)|
| 1:37:03| and you can't even see the building if you stood at Asheville Highway and craned your neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5823)|
| 1:37:08| It has a value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| It had a value to the vets because it was their meeting place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5830)|
| 1:37:14| It has a value to this potential purchaser because it has a great deal of storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| in a building that's sort of secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5839)|
| 1:37:22| It's like a warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| The windows are bricked up, and it's done nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| And if you put the landscaping in, you kind of wonder who's really going to be impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| He's talking about having four auctions a year, one day wonders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5853)|
| 1:37:39| and a lot of that these days is done online where people participate by telephone and online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5859)|
| 1:37:46| So in terms of potential harm, it's very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| In terms of outdoor storage, one, we're not permitting it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| and two, it wouldn't do anyone any good if you put outdoor storage there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5875)|
| 1:37:59| You couldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5879)|
| 1:38:01| You'd have to be going up that little narrow road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5881)|
| 1:38:03| So it's really a situation where we have a seller group that needs to move their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5883)|
| 1:38:11| Their members are getting older.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5891)|
| 1:38:12| They want to be downtown for certain advantages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5892)|
| 1:38:15| and we have someone that has a sort of a unique use that's not very intrusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| So it's certainly a case to be more flexible, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| and I will support the C-4 with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| Mr. Fox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5907)|
| 1:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5908)|
| 1:38:29| I remembered something from a number of years ago when I sat one seat to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| and briefly conferred with Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| I'd like Mr. Seymour and Mr. Kelly in particular to listen to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5916)|
| 1:38:40| When I was on council, there was an issue with a market off of Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5920)|
| 1:38:44| I think it was called Doane's Market, and they were needing a certain type of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5924)|
| 1:38:48| but there was an issue with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5928)|
| 1:38:52| So applying what happened there to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5932)|
| 1:38:56| what would be the possibility of this council approving the C-4 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| to take care of this gentleman's desire for an auction house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5942)|
| 1:39:06| and then immediately on the next council agenda prepare a resolution asking MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5946)|
| 1:39:12| to look at downzoning that property where that would give that gentleman the grandfathered use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5952)|
| 1:39:17| for an auction house and then maybe address the outside storage issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5957)|
| 1:39:24| and those other issues that other people may be concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5964)|
| 1:39:32| Mr. Coker, and he can kick me if he disagrees with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5972)|
| 1:39:37| but he is in no other business other than auctions and antique sales, appraisals, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| I don't think it would make any difference to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| And one of these days, I think I've heard optimistic timelines, there's going to be a new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5987)|
| 1:39:55| He is stuck because the only place an auction house is allowed in the city of Knoxville is in a C-4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=5995)|
| 1:40:03| It would seem to fit very readily into a C-3 zone or any other commercial sales zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6003)|
| 1:40:09| Do you understand what they're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| Do you have any objection to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6012)|
| 1:40:18| If that's what it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| Vice Mayor Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Mr. Seymour, you said what I was just going to say over the fact that it seems like we have a situation here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6024)|
| 1:40:29| where an auction house is stuck into a particular zone that maybe it doesn't belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| and especially with what's happening to auctions today and tomorrow with the Internet and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| I think the other thing that makes this one a bit different than some of the other issues we've dealt with tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| in the last couple of weeks, I haven't heard anything from any of the neighbors in terms of any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| I don't know if the rest of you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6049)|
| 1:40:51| And so I think that from what I understand is that the neighbors are hoping that something good continues to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6051)|
| 1:40:56| with that piece of property instead of it going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| And so Mr. Coker has a business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| We know it's well established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| We know what he's done in the past in this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| And so, again, I just want to stress the fact that we haven't heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6066)|
| 1:41:09| I have not heard anything from any of the neighbors in terms of being opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| So I certainly support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| This is the one, two, three, fourth public hearing on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6077)|
| 1:41:25| and no one has spoken in opposition from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Our opposition has been MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| Earn those planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| Let him open before you pass that resolution, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| Another potential option is a resolution asking MPC to study whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| or not auction houses should be in, for sake of argument, a C3 or a C1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| That would be an easy way to cure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6119)|
| 1:42:03| I don't know how auction houses got mentioned in the C4 zone and not in the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| There is an auction house on Central Avenue that is C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| but I think it was passed by city council with conditions similar to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| As I recall, it was no car sales, was it not, Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6141)|
| 1:42:28| I don't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6148)|
| 1:42:29| But it's in the city right off Central and Bruin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6149)|
| 1:42:39| He sells an occasional car when it's part of an estate, but generally it's sold off-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6159)|
| 1:42:46| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| May I ask a question of Arthur?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| How much is outdoor storage an important element of this business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| Oh, no, he's not going to store anything outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| Furniture don't do well outdoors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6179)|
| 1:43:03| He may have old wagon wheels or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| No, that's the attraction of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| Could we add that as an additional condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6193)|
| 1:43:15| Are we allowed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6195)|
| 1:43:16| No outdoor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| We have a motion to amend to C4 with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6201)|
| 1:43:22| And I'm suggesting we add an additional condition, no outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6202)|
| 1:43:27| Who made that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| Which he doesn't care about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6208)|
| 1:43:30| George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| Who asked to call the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6214)|
| 1:43:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| So call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| He's raised a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| We have to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| Would you accept a friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| He wants to allow him to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| Would you pull that back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| No, I think let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6231)|
| 1:43:54| Another week if you want to change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6237)|
| 1:43:58| So we're voting on the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6238)|
| 1:44:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6241)|
| 1:44:02| We have a motion and a second on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6243)|
| 1:44:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6244)|
| 1:44:05| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6247)|
| 1:44:08| The call for the question passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| So we are now on the motion to amend to C4 with the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| Is it now germane for me to ask if we can add an additional condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| No outdoor storage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| The problem is you can't amend an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6269)|
| 1:44:31| So you can have a second amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| So if this passes, then you can amend it a second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6274)|
| 1:44:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6277)|
| 1:44:38| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Wouldn't the call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6283)|
| 1:44:45| So we are voting now to amend to C4 with conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6285)|
| 1:44:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| One no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| So that's 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6297)|
| 1:44:58| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6298)|
| 1:44:59| And now are there any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| Did you want to make an amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| Yeah, I would like to propose an amendment that would be the fourth condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6304)|

| 1:45:13| It's an indoor operation, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6313)|
| 1:45:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| We have a motion and a second for an amendment that there be no outdoor storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| Did you want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| Or display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| Or display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6326)|
| 1:45:27| Or display.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6327)|
| 1:45:28| No, I don't want to speak to that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6329)|
| 1:45:30| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6330)|
| 1:45:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6331)|
| 1:45:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6332)|
| 1:45:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| That amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| We are now back to the original motion to rezone with as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6343)|
| 1:45:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| Well, I'm going to go ahead and support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6345)|
| 1:45:49| I love the suggestion that our counselor made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6349)|
| 1:45:52| Let's see if we can do something down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6352)|
| 1:45:54| But I obviously have some discomfort with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6354)|
| 1:45:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6359)|
| 1:46:00| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6364)|
| 1:46:05| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6365)|
| 1:46:07| This is a business that runs on antacids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6367)|
| 1:46:10| We'll deal with it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6373)|
| 1:46:14| We are going to take a five-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| We'll be right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6377)|
| 1:46:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6383)|
| 1:46:24| Mr. Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6384)|
| 1:46:26| 12M is an ordinance approving the request of Ed Smith, Pratt Partners LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| for an amendment to the North City Sector Plan from LDR to O,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6390)|
| 1:46:34| for a property located on the northeast side of Pratt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| northwest of Cedar Lane, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6400)|
| 1:46:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6404)|
| 1:46:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6407)|
| 1:46:49| I just didn't know who all signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6409)|
| 1:46:51| I wanted to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| Yes, I have two people signed up, Mr. Seymour and Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6412)|
| 1:46:56| Would you like to hear from them now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6416)|
| 1:46:59| Oh, well, I just wanted to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| I have talked with some of the residents in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| and there was one concerned resident up the street from here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6425)|
| 1:47:10| and we weren't able to get them together before tonight's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6430)|
| 1:47:14| but I told them I was going to motion first to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6434)|
| 1:47:19| But in hopes that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| But you're on my motion if you want to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| No, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| It was just fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6445)|
| 1:47:27| But suffice to say, they're going to meet tomorrow evening just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6447)|
| 1:47:32| answer any questions and concerns they may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| But so far I haven't heard any other opposition to the proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6454)|
| 1:47:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6460)|
| 1:47:42| Do you wish to speak or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6462)|
| 1:47:44| Mr. Seymour and Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6464)|
| 1:47:47| We were just going to speak in favor of the motion and the MPC action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6467)|
| 1:47:52| and answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6472)|
| 1:47:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6475)|
| 1:47:56| As I understand this, this is in that commercial section of Merchant Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6476)|
| 1:48:02| There's supermarkets and convenience stores and restaurants and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6482)|
| 1:48:08| and even hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| This is a commercial section of Merchant Road before you get to the railroad track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6490)|
| 1:48:14| before you get to the part that starts to go residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6494)|
| 1:48:17| and it's on this side of the tracks, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6497)|
| 1:48:20| It's immediately adjacent to the rear of the Ingalls grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| We're asking for 01, which permits a hotel as a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| So if we obtain your all's approval, we will be going back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| So the plans will have to be looked at before it's built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6515)|
| 1:48:38| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| It will go back for a public hearing at the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| Is this in part in that location of the empty building that's there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6522)|
| 1:48:45| It looks like a dead steak restaurant or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6525)|
| 1:48:49| It is just to the west of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6529)|
| 1:48:51| That is on Ingalls property and is not for sale, we understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6531)|
| 1:48:57| So it's the vacant land that's right next to Ingalls?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| Right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| Right behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| Mayor, I'm sorry, I just wanted to clarify for Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| I mean, the area is right up against R1 and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6551)|
| 1:49:15| and that's of the concern when you look at the existing Hampton Inn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6555)|
| 1:49:19| and look at the houses and where they plan to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6559)|
| 1:49:22| But, you know, like I say, in general we've got to, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6562)|
| 1:49:28| be careful for future developments in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| We don't need to encroach further back into Pratt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6572)|
| 1:49:34| I think some of the concerns were trucks coming in through the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6574)|
| 1:49:38| from the back, but I've been told that any of the routing for any deliveries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6578)|
| 1:49:43| would come right off of Merchants or Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| The GPS routes you to the Hampton Inn off of Cedar Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6588)|
| 1:49:52| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6592)|
| 1:49:53| Well, like I say, if there's any of these concerns that are further aggravated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6593)|
| 1:49:57| after the meeting tomorrow evening's meeting with the residents in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6597)|
| 1:50:01| then, you know, we've got time before next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6601)|
| 1:50:06| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6606)|
| 1:50:07| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6607)|
| 1:50:08| Mr. Kelly, I assume that in reviewing plans you can make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6608)|
| 1:50:13| that activity is not directed to the rear of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| where there may be the next thing over being residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6616)|
| 1:50:20| that you can keep it in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6620)|
| 1:50:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6622)|
| 1:50:23| When they first came in they were talking about a commercial zone for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6623)|
| 1:50:27| We talked to them about the O1, the idea of the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| so there could be some landscaping and some other items like that could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6633)|
| 1:50:37| And try to provide a little separation between them and the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6637)|
| 1:50:43| And you could control access points at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6643)|
| 1:50:46| We can control access onto the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| and there can be a condition with regard to how deliveries are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6648)|
| 1:50:52| the routing of the trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6652)|
| 1:50:54| You have that power when you look at the plans themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6654)|
| 1:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6657)|
| 1:50:58| And we have talked to the HOA president, Tower Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6658)|
| 1:51:02| and she was supportive of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| Mr. Smith has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve 12M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6669)|
| 1:51:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6673)|

| 1:51:16| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6676)|
| 1:51:18| 12N is an ordinance approving the request of Ed Smith, Pratt Partners LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| for a one-year planned amendment from low-density residential to office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6682)|

| 1:52:07| property located on the southwest side of Palmer Street southeast of Hawthorne Avenue, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6727)|
| 1:52:14| Mayor, I'd like to recognize Mr. Kearns here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| I don't think he signed up, but I'd like for him to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6737)|
| 1:52:22| David Kearns, 410 Locust Hill in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| I appreciate you hearing me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| I am very ignorant about how this all works, so forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6749)|
| 1:52:34| I had went to MPC and I'd asked for three things to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| It surprised me that there were three things, but one was zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| One was a sector vector change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6762)|

| 1:52:48| I don't even understand them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| We don't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| So we had asked for C3 so that we could build a boutique hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6773)|
| 1:52:59| Pretty much run like a hostel in the back of the three restaurants that are on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6779)|
| 1:53:05| And after a lot of discussion, the city or MPC had approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6785)|
| 1:53:11| Some things were changed to C4, and then at the end it was O1 instead of C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6791)|
| 1:53:16| And after watching what just happened, I wondered if I couldn't override what MPC recommended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| although I feel really embarrassed asking to do that, asking you to be consistent with what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6803)|
| 1:53:30| and approve C3 for me so I don't have to go back to them and I can get to work doing what I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6810)|
| 1:53:41| All right, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Yeah, I wouldn't be comfortable doing that this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| although I want to go ahead and approve these three measures for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6827)|
| 1:53:57| And then my suggestion during the break time to him, I mean, he's curious about perhaps putting in a hostel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6837)|
| 1:54:03| and I know there's another situation in South Knoxville that another person is going to be interested in a hostel as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6843)|
| 1:54:12| The problem that he has, the code, we don't have a hostel in the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| which doesn't mean that we couldn't put it in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6858)|
| 1:54:22| So, you know, they advised him, and rightfully so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6862)|
| 1:54:25| just what happened with the Hampton Inn there for an O1 and then go back for a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6865)|
| 1:54:30| So I think that is the best course of action for you to take tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| knowing that, number one, you're going to have to come back in two weeks and let you think through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6874)|
| 1:54:42| And I'm glad to help you through this process and make sure that you pursue what you really want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6882)|
| 1:54:52| It's just not that easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6892)|
| 1:54:53| I mean, as you saw, you referred to what happened with the school property, but that was a long, drawn-out process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| We didn't just come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| It would be unusual for us to make that override, if you will, just with a three-minute conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6903)|
| 1:55:12| So I want to help you, and we can give you some sage advice, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| Well, I appreciate that, Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| Like, I don't want to delay it any longer than I need to, and I don't want to make anybody mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| I was just kind of dumbfounded that it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| And I thought, like the people at the MPC, I know they all volunteer their time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| and they put a lot of their time into all the discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| And just from the layman, it looked like you guys were kind of cavalier about what all the work that they put into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| and then you changed it from O1 to C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| And I thought, well, it would be silly for me to not come up here and ask you, hey, do the same thing for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| I'm not a lawyer, and I don't have a paid advocate, but I don't know how unfair it is for me to simply say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| hey, do for me what you did for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6958)|
| 1:56:00| This is citizens in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| And if the board, what MPC does is really important, and I do not want to be an advocate for MPC because it drove me crazy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| but they're volunteers that spend a lot of time and effort, and they're obviously intelligent folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6969)|
| 1:56:15| and they can do other things with their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6975)|
| 1:56:18| And gosh, shouldn't we value what they've done and what they recommend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6978)|
| 1:56:24| You know, and the whole gist of it, looking at the codes and the different controls and the different maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6984)|
| 1:56:31| and they actually have layered maps up there where they were putting them down on top of each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6991)|
| 1:56:35| and it really didn't make – I know the guy explaining it to me was pretty confused about trying to explain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| and I'm still ignorant as all about how they all won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| I'd like to think that there was a great big master plan and somebody knew everything that was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7005)|
| 1:56:50| but the more I involve myself with it, the less I believe that that mastermind exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7010)|
| 1:56:58| Well, there are – I mean, this is what we would be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7018)|
| 1:57:02| The plans that are in place, you're asking for us to amend that to a pretty – if it was a C-4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7022)|
| 1:57:15| I mean, there's a lot of things that can happen in a C-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7035)|
| 1:57:18| Well, what's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| You're not going to make MPC mad about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7040)|
| 1:57:23| I mean, this happens – you know, it's not a rare – it doesn't happen every meeting, but it's not a rare occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7043)|
| 1:57:30| I just want to make sure that you know that I'm willing to help you if that – your original –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7050)|
| 1:57:37| what you came to MPC to do is not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7057)|
| 1:57:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7062)|
| 1:57:43| And you're not going to make anybody mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| I mean, and I would love to see that development because I know exactly where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7066)|
| 1:57:49| Like I told you, I drive – you know, it's a – I don't want to say a cut-through, but I guess it's a cut-through for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| but it's a unique piece of property that if you're willing to invest in it and develop it in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| then I want to help you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7081)|
| 1:58:03| Well, sir, if I could come back in two weeks and try to make that motion, I would be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| Well, I mean, so my suggestion to you is, as we discussed, I would like to postpone it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7089)|
| 1:58:18| and have discussion with the MPC folks and with our codes with Peter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7098)|
| 1:58:24| and make sure that you're stating you're right, that you understand things that can and cannot happen in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7104)|
| 1:58:31| And I'm glad to pass this tonight on first reading because like just what we did for the Hampton, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| they're going to have to go on a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| They got the L1 and the motel or hotel is in an approved use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| So if it gets sent back two weeks, would the second reading then be two weeks or four weeks after that automatically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7125)|
| 1:58:51| Well, yeah, I mean, unless we did it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| But, I mean, I'm not a huge proponent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7135)|
| 1:58:59| But my inclination is to go, is to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7139)|
| 1:59:04| But I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7144)|
| 1:59:06| So I think what I'm going to do is make the motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| I already have made the motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7151)|
| 1:59:13| I think I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| Well, I'm going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7155)|
| 1:59:16| And then we still have the two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7156)|
| 1:59:18| And if we, at the end of those two weeks, if we need two more weeks, then we've got two more weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| So you're, it's a motion to approve as it is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7169)|
| 1:59:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7171)|
| 1:59:32| Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| Yeah, just a quick comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| I just wanted to tell this gentleman, while some of the rules in zoning are technical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| the goal is to try to put various uses that are compatible in groups so that if you do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7179)|
| 1:59:48| it won't hurt the neighbors, the neighbors won't hurt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| And so the idea of a use-on-review where it goes back to MPC is to look at your plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| and sort of help you tweak them, because our ultimate goal here is to let all the property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7197)|
| 2:00:05| sort of live in peace and not be disturbed by the next-door neighbor's use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7205)|
| 2:00:09| And that makes a whole bunch of technical rules, but at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7209)|
| 2:00:13| we're sitting here trying to resolve specific facts that don't quite fit in the formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| But everyone's working towards the same end, which is to allow development that is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7219)|
| 2:00:26| and not adverse to what the neighbors are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7226)|
| 2:00:29| So I don't know if that helps or not, but that's a big-picture thing anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| I'd like to add, just for the record, anybody else who might be observing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7234)|
| 2:00:37| that the previous one where you all voted to amend the actual zone, that had been vetted for several months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7237)|
| 2:00:46| and so it wasn't something that just came before the body and it was changed, just so you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| Okay, so we have a motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7255)|
| 2:00:57| That was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| I'm going to approve it and then perhaps postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7261)|
| 2:01:02| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| A motion to approve, and there was a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7265)|
| 2:01:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7266)|
| 2:01:07| So more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7267)|
| 2:01:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7268)|
| 2:01:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7269)|
| 2:01:10| Your light's on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| Okay, so motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7271)|
| 2:01:13| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7273)|
| 2:01:14| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| Is that on all three of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7277)|
| 2:01:19| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7279)|
| 2:01:20| Well, she has to call them all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| They will in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7283)|
| 2:01:24| 12Q is an ordinance approving the request of David Curran for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7284)|

| 2:01:45| I'm not sure what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7305)|

| 2:03:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7423)|
| 2:03:44| Mr. Kelly, what was the original staff recommendation on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7424)|
| 2:03:49| The original staff recommendation was to deny the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| The northwest, or excuse me, yes, the Northwest Sector Plan had recently been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7434)|
| 2:04:03| There was no reason identified to change the sector plan at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7443)|
| 2:04:09| And we believe that under the current zoning, the property owner had a good use with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7449)|
| 2:04:20| Well, we just had a long discussion about C4 and I sort of tend to agree with the staff recommendation on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7460)|
| 2:04:30| Are you Mr. Hopper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7470)|
| 2:04:31| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7471)|
| 2:04:32| I'm Robert Campbell representing Mr. Hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7472)|
| 2:04:33| Oh, yes, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7473)|
| 2:04:34| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7474)|
| 2:04:35| You're fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| To me, there's, from reading what's in the packet, there's a lot of C4 in the area that's unused and just to create a glut of it, to me, doesn't seem like the right thing to do at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7477)|
| 2:04:51| Mr. Campbell is here to answer any questions if council has any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7491)|
| 2:05:00| Do you have any plans for the property, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| Yeah, well, I'll just, let me address it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7502)|
| 2:05:04| Robert Campbell, 7523 Taggart Lane, and we know that was the original recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| If you look at the property, it's surrounded by C4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| Excuse me, commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7512)|
| 2:05:14| I think we're about 500 feet actually from Lowe's, Target, and a lot of those other type of businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7514)|
| 2:05:20| Mr. Hopper has been approached in the past about possibly selling the property, but they want it to be commercially zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7520)|
| 2:05:26| I would argue slightly with what MPC said, that there's a glut of property because not all property is created equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7526)|
| 2:05:32| Our property has access to Callahan Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| Our property is topographically extremely good where a lot of the other properties that are zoned are on hillsides or going into creeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7535)|
| 2:05:44| and I would say that they're more topographically challenged than this piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| and I don't know that MPC did that analysis on what was usable from those pieces of property that were already zoned commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7548)|
| 2:05:55| Again, if you look at standard planning practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| and unfortunately I've been through on both sides of every part of this planning process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7558)|
| 2:06:03| you typically start at major intersections going out, and you get commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| and then as you get further away, you get into less dense use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| We are at a major intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7573)|
| 2:06:15| Callahan Drive is a five-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| Excuse me, four-lane divided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| Clinton Highway is five and six and ten, I think, in some places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7580)|
| 2:06:25| So we're at those intersections with a, I believe the county is extending actually Callahan through Shawd at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7585)|
| 2:06:35| so that'll be five all the way through to Middlebrook Park, which also puts more commercial pressure through this corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7595)|
| 2:06:42| We have car dealerships located on El Callahan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| We have many, many commercial establishments left and right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7604)|
| 2:06:49| and so we believe that this is the only piece of office that's in the sea of commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7609)|
| 2:06:55| and most of that commercial is either being used, has some proposed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| and so I would disagree with MPC's assessment that there's too much commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7620)|
| 2:07:06| I think Mr. Hopper has, again, had people that have requested to at least engage in conversations about buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7626)|
| 2:07:13| I'm not going to say there's contracts pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| I mean, I would not tell you that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| but they've all said that commercial was something that they wanted it to be before they would consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| If I may, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7644)|
| 2:07:26| Mr. Colley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7646)|
| 2:07:29| What I said was talking about the staff recommendation and what the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| and I'm here representing the Planning Commission this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7654)|
| 2:07:37| The Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of this rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| and I believe they showed us the error in our ways in making that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7661)|
| 2:07:48| All right, I'm all set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| Okay, so we have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7678)|
| 2:07:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7679)|
| 2:08:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7680)|
| 2:08:01| None.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7681)|
| 2:08:02| We have one opposed, but it passes 8-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7684)|

| 2:08:49| Right, so you made a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7729)|

| 2:09:25| Okay, well, Ms. Riffey, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7765)|
| 2:09:32| You know the drill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| You've been here before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| You have up to five minutes, and please state your name and address for the record, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| My name is Kenny Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7779)|
| 2:09:41| I live at 2320 East Fifth Avenue, and that is in the Park Ridge community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7781)|
| 2:09:47| I am here to express that I am against the historic overlay that's been proposed for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7787)|
| 2:09:55| the Park Ridge community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7795)|
| 2:10:00| My understanding is that some months back it was brought before the council to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7800)|
| 2:10:07| to have historic zoning look into whether there should be an extension of the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7812)|
| 2:10:14| I attended two of the public meetings and was surprised to hear that that had come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7814)|
| 2:10:21| the council because there was quite a bit of objection in the community to this overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| My understanding, though, is that the community organization, the ones who initiated the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7828)|
| 2:10:34| discussion, voted and said, we want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| And so they took it to Dan Brown, and Dan Brown brought it to the council as its protocol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7839)|
| 2:10:45| I thought, I don't have a group of people standing behind me yet, and I don't have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| big petition yet, but I do want to at least stand here and make the statement that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| are people out there who are against this extended overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7856)|
| 2:11:01| I spoke to Kay Graybiel within the last week or so, and she said she's not far off from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7861)|
| 2:11:07| she's done her research, she's not far off from bringing her information to start her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7867)|
| 2:11:10| process flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7870)|
| 2:11:11| So I wanted to make sure I got in here and at least stated my objection, and then I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7871)|
| 2:11:16| begin to work diligently to get those folks either here or get petitions together, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7876)|
| 2:11:22| If you go on the Park Ridge Community Organization's website, they state that there are 1,800 residences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7882)|
| 2:11:29| in Park Ridge with 2,774 people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7889)|
| 2:11:35| I will tell you that as I was a member of the Park Ridge Community Organization, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| I never knew them at any time to have more than maybe 50 or 60 members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7900)|
| 2:11:46| So that leaves some 2,700 people who have not expressed for or against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7906)|
| 2:11:53| In the public forums, people were saying, well, they can't put this historic overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7913)|
| 2:11:58| in unless we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| We're allowed by block right to vote, and Kay explained the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7920)|
| 2:12:06| If the city council votes for a historic overlay, there is a historic overlay in Park Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7926)|
| 2:12:12| So there are people out there who are under the same misunderstanding as those who actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7932)|
| 2:12:17| showed up at the meetings and asked the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| They think that this historic overlay cannot happen unless they vote, and that's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7940)|
| 2:12:27| A small group of investors and people who live in the existing historic overlay are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7947)|
| 2:12:35| members of the board and members of the Park Ridge Community Organization, and if you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| at the demographic of that organization, you'll find that more than half of them are owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7960)|
| 2:12:46| of multiple pieces of property in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7966)|
| 2:12:49| The majority live in the historic overlay, and so they have a vested interest in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7969)|
| 2:12:56| phrase that keeps coming up is, this will increase property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7976)|
| 2:13:01| In 2007, I moved into Park Ridge to become a part of the community and not to begin to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7981)|
| 2:13:07| displace people who live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7987)|
| 2:13:10| I wanted to work to uplift the community as a part of the community, and I see people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7990)|
| 2:13:15| around me who have lived there for 10, 15, I spoke to a man this morning who lived there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=7995)|
| 2:13:21| for 46 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8001)|
| 2:13:23| He doesn't know what's about to happen to him when this very restrictive overlay, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| and hopefully not, this very restrictive overlay comes into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| If he has repairs that he needs to do to his home or improvements he wants to do, he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8013)|
| 2:13:38| going to have to ask permission and go through what can potentially be a very lengthy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8018)|
| 2:13:42| expensive process, because the historic overlay that they're asking to put in place is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8028)|
| 2:13:50| And my question is, why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8030)|
| 2:13:52| Why are you going to take 1,800 residences and 2,774 people in East Knoxville and put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8032)|
| 2:14:00| this restriction on them and on their homes when they need to be able to make the repairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8040)|
| 2:14:06| necessary to help to uplift their properties within this community that's going in through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8046)|
| 2:14:12| a great deal of transformation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| It's an obvious extension of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8054)|
| 2:14:17| Hall of Fame Drive opened it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8057)|
| 2:14:19| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| People are moving in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8060)|
| 2:14:21| The demographic in that community has changed dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8061)|
| 2:14:24| People are fixing their properties up, but some of them can't do it as quickly as others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| because they are in lower or middle income situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8068)|
| 2:14:32| But they're doing it, and it's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| That's a natural course of events, and I think a historic overlay is simply a way to ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8075)|
| 2:14:42| displace some of these homeowners who will not be able to afford the repairs that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8082)|
| 2:14:48| need to be made to their homes because of the restrictions that are in the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8088)|
| 2:14:54| for the historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8094)|
| 2:14:55| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8095)|
| 2:14:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8097)|
| 2:14:58| This area is already a National Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8098)|
| 2:15:02| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8102)|
| 2:15:03| It's a wonderful neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8103)|
| 2:15:05| I love living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8105)|
| 2:15:07| I think that it's important before anything happens with this historic overlay that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8107)|
| 2:15:12| council and these members, I've heard you talking about vetting these things, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8112)|
| 2:15:16| think that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| Go out and look in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8117)|
| 2:15:18| I'll be happy to walk you through my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| Before putting something so restrictive in, I think it's important to listen to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| who live there, and not just 30 of the 2,774 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| So this is just my way to say I want to start this conversation, and I will plan to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| for every other one of these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8137)|
| 2:15:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8140)|
| 2:15:41| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| Okay, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| I wonder if I could ask Dan Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| Dan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| Dan, I wonder if I can ask you a question real quick after you write that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| That is, what process occurs in MPC as this historic overlay is being looked at by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8154)|
| 2:16:05| Graybeal, her staff, because she raises a concern about who really is affected by it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8165)|
| 2:16:13| and how do they participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8173)|
| 2:16:15| Can you tell us briefly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| The H1 overlay is a rezoning of the property and will require action by the Historic Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8178)|
| 2:16:26| Commission, MPC, and City Council before it can be put in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8186)|
| 2:16:33| It's not something that the Historic Zoning Commission can do unilaterally and it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8193)|
| 2:16:39| to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8199)|
| 2:16:41| It's a process just like any other zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8201)|
| 2:16:45| Kay, who has been working on a survey, a historic survey of the area, will present that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8205)|
| 2:16:53| to the Historic Zoning Commission and MPC and Council, and you will have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8213)|
| 2:16:59| to accept or reject that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8219)|
| 2:17:01| Do they have in-neighborhood meetings at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8221)|
| 2:17:04| They have had some, but she's suggesting that meeting with the organization that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| other people that we need to be reaching out to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8229)|
| 2:17:12| Yeah, to be more inclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8233)|
| 2:17:16| Ms. Riffey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8236)|
| 2:17:17| Riffey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8237)|
| 2:17:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8238)|
| 2:17:19| Riffey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8239)|
| 2:17:20| If she knows of other organizations or other, you know, where we can pull people together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8240)|
| 2:17:26| I'm sure Kay would be more than happy to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8246)|
| 2:17:30| Kay is a strong proponent of historic preservation and she would like to be able to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8250)|
| 2:17:36| and talk to people about what it means and what, and you can voice your concerns too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8256)|
| 2:17:45| But again, the Historic Zoning Commission, MPC, and City Council are going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| act on it before it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8270)|
| 2:17:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8272)|
| 2:17:53| Am I allowed to respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| No, you're really here to make a presentation to us, but I wanted to find out how inclusive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8274)|
| 2:17:59| their sort of field survey is, because obviously you're thinking a lot of people are not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8279)|
| 2:18:05| included and that's a concern of mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8285)|
| 2:18:08| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8288)|
| 2:18:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8289)|
| 2:18:11| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8291)|
| 2:18:12| So we are now adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160816?start=8292)|
