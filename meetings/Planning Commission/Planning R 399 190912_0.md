| 0:01:10| We receive no salary and volunteer our time as a service to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| I hope all of you picked up an agenda handout in the lobby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=75)|

| 0:01:27| Many of the items we vote on require further action by the city council or county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=87)|
| 0:01:33| And in the handout is the meeting schedule for these legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=93)|
| 0:01:38| For matters that are forwarded to the county commission for final action, particularly rezoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=98)|
| 0:01:44| the applicant must be present at the county commission meeting at which the request will be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| Applicants will be notified of the meeting date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=110)|

| 0:01:59| I would also like to refer you to the Knoxville-Knox County Planning's outstanding website, www.knoxplanning.org,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=119)|
| 0:02:09| for an online agenda and additional information on this and future meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| Today's agenda will be conducted in the order of the printed agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=134)|

| 0:02:22| After each item is called, I will read the staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| On certain items, I will call on staff to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| At this time, the applicant may address the commission or defer his or her opening remarks and allow any opposition to speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=151)|
| 0:02:41| The applicant and those in support of the applicant will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=161)|

| 0:02:50| The opposition also will be given a total of five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=170)|
| 0:02:55| If either side wishes to rebut, you will need to reserve time from your allotted five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| If you plan to speak on an agenda item, please sign in when you are at the podium so we have your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=181)|

| 0:03:13| and should avoid repeating comments that have been previously presented to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=193)|
| 0:03:18| The commission may choose to extend the time allowed for both parties and may ask questions of any speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=198)|
| 0:03:25| Because of the number of items we have before us, groups in favor or opposed to an item are asked to appoint a spokesperson to represent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=205)|
| 0:03:35| All speakers should come to the podium and speak directly into the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=215)|

| 0:12:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=733)|
| 0:12:14| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve consent list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=739)|
| 0:12:21| Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| Wonderful. We are on to our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| And we're starting with item number 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=748)|
| 0:12:34| The applicant is Knoxville, Knox County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| This is a street road name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| The change is requested from Ginn Drive to Quiet Side Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=762)|
| 0:12:48| The location is between Alcoa Highway and the dead end of Ginn Drive at Maloney Road Park, southwest of Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=768)|
| 0:12:57| The applicant's reason for change is TDOT Project NH-11554, 47026-04, realignment of Alcoa Highway, State Route 115, U.S. Route 129.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=777)|
| 0:13:14| Staff recommendation is to approve the name change to Quiet Side Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=794)|
| 0:13:24| Commissioner Graf, would you like to begin the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=804)|
| 0:13:27| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| The reason I brought this up, I'm familiar with Ginn Road and Alcoa Highway for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=809)|
| 0:13:39| And just because you divide the road in half, Ginn's were early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=819)|
| 0:13:50| They had farms there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| They kind of settled that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| And they're finally all deceased now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| But the farmhouse, there's a small cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| The family home was on the side of Alcoa Highway that is being renamed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=847)|
| 0:14:18| And I think that it would be better if we renamed the other side of Alcoa Highway and left this as Ginn Road in deference to the family that pretty well settled it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=858)|
| 0:14:35| I would move that, well, that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| Second to that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=884)|
| 0:14:49| I'm trying to figure out if you'd rather just deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| We're going to have to advertise for the other segment of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| What you're proposing is that staff bring back to you that the eastern portion of the segment of the road be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=894)|
| 0:15:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=902)|
| 0:15:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| Well, postpone will suffice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| We'll have to re-advertise with a complete new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| And staff will work to adjust the names to honor the Ginn family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| The motion currently is to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| 30 days by Commissioner Graf and second by Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=921)|
| 0:15:28| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| I don't see anyone from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=937)|
| 0:15:40| We are on to agenda item number eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| This is the consideration of Governor John Sevier's Scenic Highway Corridor Study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| Council Districts 1 and 4, Commission Districts 8 and 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| And I'm going to turn this over to Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| I'll make a few introductory comments and then turn it over to Liz Albertson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| the planner who was in charge of the preparation of the corridor's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| About a year and a half, two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Commissioner Daley of the County Commission requested staff to pursue a corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| for the John Sevier Scenic Highway to recognize the growth of that corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| and to work with the community to identify ways to protect the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=984)|
| 0:16:29| in the light of the continuing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=989)|
| 0:16:33| Ms. Albertson worked with a group of stakeholders at several community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=993)|
| 0:16:38| We appreciate the business that allowed us to use their facilities on Sunday afternoons for community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| having them at that time work that well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| And we are honored to present this in recognition of Commissioner Daley's request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| which was also endorsed by the full County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| With that, I'll turn it over to Ms. Albertson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1015)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you, Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| As he mentioned, this study engaged approximately 155 people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| The stakeholder committee as well reviewed feedback that we got related to the corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1029)|
| 0:17:16| issues and concerns that had been identified over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| as well as items that continue to come up along the John Sevier Highway corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| that is generally rural and scenic in character through the majority of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| However, there is a large industrial portion of the corridor as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| The community group noted that the existing scenic highway legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| that the state of Tennessee has for the corridor does not fully protect it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| protect its rural character or historic character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| There are two major historic resources in the corridor, the Marble Springs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1071)|
| 0:17:57| John Sevier family home, as well as the historic Ramsey House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| The group summarized three recommendations in the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1082)|
| 0:18:07| the first of which is a request to the Tennessee Department of Transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| to conduct a road safety audit of John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Staff has already begun discussions with Knox County Engineering and TDOT related to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| The second is that a draft John Sevier scenic highway corridor overlay zone be drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1102)|
| 0:18:32| and potentially adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1112)|
| 0:18:35| This would require additional community engagement and stakeholder meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| and it could potentially take up to a year to complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| It would still retain the base rights of the property owners in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| It would just affect kind of the way development looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| and maybe protecting the scenic tree line that we have in the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1131)|
| 0:18:55| Again, all that would be handled in a subsequent community engagement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1135)|
| 0:19:00| The group is also recommending scenic highway beautification projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| so for some of the existing conditions in the corridor where there's a lot of outdoor storage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| and other things that maybe don't seem as rural or scenic in character,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| that the group work with property owners to undertake some beautification projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| So those are pretty much the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| Again, this is a study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1167)|
| 0:19:30| It's not going to change anything immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| There would need to be subsequent follow-through and implementation of these recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| Is there any discussion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1184)|
| 0:19:51| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the Johnsville Scenic Highway Corridor Study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1193)|
| 0:19:57| amending the Knoxville-Knox County General Plan, 2033,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| the South County and East County Sector Plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| to approve the corridor study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| Commissioner Graf, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| I do not see any other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1219)|
| 0:20:21| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1221)|
| 0:20:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1222)|
| 0:20:23| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1223)|
| 0:20:25| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1227)|
| 0:20:28| That's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| My understanding is that this is going to be our first corridor overlay in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1231)|
| 0:20:38| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| If we get to that point, and as Ms. Albertson said, in order to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| we'd have to work with the community and bring forth an overlay district proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1244)|
| 0:20:49| for the Planning Commission's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Then that would go on to the County Commission for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1251)|
| 0:20:55| We'll be working with the community over the next approximately year to bring that to fruition, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1255)|
| 0:21:03| I think this is a really positive step for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Thank you, Liz, for all your hard work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| I know I've been to a lot of the community meetings, and I know you've done a lot of good work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| We're on to Agenda Number 9, Subdivision Report, Concept Use and Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1276)|
| 0:21:24| The subdivision is Carnes-Oakridge Highway Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| The applicant is Smithbilt, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| The location is the southeast side of Oakridge Highway, east of Gray-Hendricks Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1293)|
| 0:21:39| The zoning is PR Planned Residential and CA General Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Existing land use is vacant land, and the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1304)|
| 0:21:52| The number of lots is 28, and there are two variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1312)|
| 0:22:02| Staff recommendation is to approve variances 1 and 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| because the site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| and the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Two, approve the concept plan subject to nine conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| Three, approve the development plan for up to 28 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| and the reduction of peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| along the western boundary line subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| Applicant, would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1362)|
| 0:22:47| I just had a couple of questions in reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| Terry Kerr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1370)|
| 0:22:51| Did you also write your name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1371)|
| 0:22:53| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Your time won't start until you finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1375)|
| 0:22:57| It won't take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1377)|
| 0:22:59| Terry Kerr, and I had a couple of questions that I had already spoken to a few people about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| and had discussed a few things with Josh as well, so I'm happy with the answers that I've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1383)|
| 0:23:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1389)|
| 0:23:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1390)|
| 0:23:20| Thank you, Ms. Kerr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Applicant, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1402)|
| 0:23:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| Commissioner Flancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Yes, I'd like to make a motion that we approve variances one and two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| because the site's condition restricts compliance with the subdivision regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| and the proposed variance will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve variances one and two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| I see no other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Motion to approve the concept plan subject to none conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1440)|
| 0:24:06| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1449)|
| 0:24:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1451)|
| 0:24:12| Motion to approve the development plan for up to 28 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| and the reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet along the western boundary line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| subject to the one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1462)|
| 0:24:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1464)|
| 0:24:25| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1471)|
| 0:24:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1475)|
| 0:24:41| And we're moving on to agenda item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1481)|
| 0:24:51| This is under a subdivision report, concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1491)|
| 0:24:55| The subdivision is Brooks Meadow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1495)|
| 0:24:58| The applicant is Masana Investments, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1498)|
| 0:25:03| The location is east side of Old Rutledge Pike, north side of Mascot Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1503)|
| 0:25:10| Approximate acreage is 10.09 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| The zoning is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| Existing land use is rural residential and vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| And the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1521)|
| 0:25:25| The number of lots is 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| And the staff recommendation is to approve the concept plan subject to eight conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| also to approve the development plan for up to 46 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| and the requested reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet as identified on the concept plan subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1541)|
| 0:25:51| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| We've missed you the last couple of meetings, Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Applicant, would you like the opposition to go first or would you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1566)|
| 0:26:08| Sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1568)|
| 0:26:19| My name is James Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I live at 8500 Terrell Wind Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| If you wouldn't mind jotting down your name and address on the sheet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| It's already here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| I'm here, too, about a petition also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| They have proposed a connection between our subdivision and this subdivision, which has no use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1595)|
| 0:26:43| I talked to Mr. Davis about it, and he's not for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| We don't know why it was put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| They want a 10-foot walkway between our subdivision and that subdivision where people can come back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1610)|
| 0:26:58| I've lived right there for 15 years, and I'll be right next to his subdivision, nothing but a row of trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1618)|
| 0:27:06| But I still don't think that we need a corridor through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| And like I said, I have had a hard time going through myself trying to go through the subdivision with people working and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1630)|
| 0:27:19| but I still have at least 60 names of people in our subdivision that doesn't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| I spoke to Mr. Beeler, which is our 8th District Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| He didn't understand why this would even be proposed because there's no reason to connect subdivisions together when they're already separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1652)|
| 0:27:43| This was only just a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| Mr. Davis wants to build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| I mean, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Like I said, I'm right next door to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| But we want you to consider at least these 60 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| If you would like to give that to Mr. Breschke at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1678)|
| 0:28:01| And, Mr. Reynolds, could you speak to this, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1681)|
| 0:28:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| The staff did request that the applicant put in a sidewalk connection between the two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1686)|
| 0:28:14| The adjacent subdivision does have a stub out road, Tailwind Lane, that was originally intended to come into this lot with a road extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1694)|
| 0:28:25| Staff did not feel that it was beneficial to connect the two subdivisions via a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1705)|
| 0:28:34| but we did feel that at least having a sidewalk connection where pedestrians could walk freely between the two still served a purpose that was viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1714)|
| 0:28:44| and we felt that it was necessary to continue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| The subdivision, you live over on the Tailwind side, I'm assuming?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| Yes, ma'am. I live on Tailwind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1736)|
| 0:28:58| And you folks have sidewalks in that subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Do you have sidewalks in that subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| No, ma'am. There's no sidewalks in that subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1743)|
| 0:29:06| There's no sidewalks over at this pipe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Okay. I was just curious if there were sidewalks in your subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| No. People haul their kids to the bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| But anyway, like I said, I've done spoke with Mr. Reynolds about this, and this is something that we do live on the dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1756)|
| 0:29:26| That's true. We live right at the dead end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| But this dead end has been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| I've been there 15 years, and this dead end has been there, and that property over from us was sold or up for sale for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1771)|
| 0:29:42| and it had nothing to do with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| It was actually not even planned for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1785)|
| 0:29:51| So our road had nothing to do with that lot ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1791)|
| 0:29:56| and I don't see why that it would be now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| And I thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1799)|
| 0:30:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| And before we go to commission, I'd like to hear from Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1801)|
| 0:30:10| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1810)|
| 0:30:15| In nurse cases, I subjectively agree that there's times in which connectivity works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| but in a case like this where adjacent property owners do not want that connector to their subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| I don't want that connector between two lots connecting to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| I don't understand why that's something we are being forced to do if none of the property owners want it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| something being forced from the fifth floor down and not by us and not by the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| And so I would respectfully request approval with one condition that that sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| or connector to the adjacent property be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Okay, stay around because we may have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| Commissioner Rutan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Yeah, I was reading the staff comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| and it does not appear that there are internal sidewalks in the newly proposed subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1868)|
| 0:31:15| and it doesn't appear that they were required to put sidewalks along Old Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| and it doesn't appear that there's any sort of commercial hub that this thing's going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| It was just some old historic commercial zoning that was out there, probably in the wrong spot anyway, I'm guessing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1885)|
| 0:31:35| and the current subdivision doesn't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| And so I would be for approving the subdivision without the connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1900)|
| 0:31:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| Commissioner Rutan, I was just going to say exactly, well, maybe not exactly what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| He probably was more eloquent than I would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| Oh, you're plenty eloquent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| He's not as frazzled as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| I'd like to make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to seven conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| removing condition number three, providing minimum five-foot wide sidewalk from road A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| determinants of tailwind drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Who was that second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| Motion by Commissioner Clancy, second by Commissioner Rutan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| That does include removing the easement also, right, not just the sidewalk, but the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1945)|
| 0:32:33| I would ask Mr. Reynolds about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| Well, yeah, the condition was to have a five-foot sidewalk within a ten-foot common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| They do show an eight-foot common area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1967)|
| 0:32:51| The plan shows a ten-foot easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| Obviously the intent with the removal of the condition would be that the easement would go away as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| But if we want to clarify that, then we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1979)|
| 0:33:03| But generally the intent there is to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| I will amend my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| And also, I mean, if you're going to remove condition number three, condition number four needs to go with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| since there are no sidewalks in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| Four pertains specifically to the sidewalk between the two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| So I'll make a motion that we approve the concept plan subject to six conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| removing condition number three and the easement, and condition number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| So you're amending your motion, not making?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| I said amending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| I'm pretty sure that's what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| Mr. Breschke, you had your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I was only going to mention that there were two conditions, but I took care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| I caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| Commissioner Graf, did that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2033)|
| 0:33:54| I keep forgetting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2034)|
| 0:33:55| That's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2035)|
| 0:33:56| I just want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Sorry, I was slow to put my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| But I do want to speak to the importance of connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2040)|
| 0:34:04| I personally live in a neighborhood that when I moved into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| lots of retired folks lived in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| But neighborhoods change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2049)|
| 0:34:10| And currently my neighborhood is full of little kids and strollers and young couples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| And the opportunity in the future to be able to connect to neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| be able to walk from even if they don't have sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2059)|
| 0:34:21| be able to walk to visit friends and neighbors or to safely ride a bicycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| without having to go into Rutledge Pike is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| And I think we're missing an opportunity for future residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2069)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| I don't disagree with Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2076)|
| 0:34:38| And had these subdivisions both been on Rutledge Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| I probably would have supported the connectivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| But Old Rutledge Pike is not really that busy of a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| I think it's not going to be that hard to get from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2092)|
| 0:34:56| Old Rutledge in three points is not a very heavily traveled road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| So if it had been on Rutledge Pike, I would have said there's a better reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| But since both people don't, that's why I made my motion and amended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2104)|
| 0:35:12| Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I agree with Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| To remove sidewalks from the current subdivision I think is just we're not looking into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2118)|
| 0:35:28| We have children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| It just makes no sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| So I cannot support that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2133)|
| 0:35:39| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| We are going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2141)|
| 0:35:42| Commissioner Clancy, did you have something else to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| I just have a question for Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| We didn't remove sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| We removed the connection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2151)|
| 0:35:57| Pull your mic down, please, Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2160)|
| 0:36:01| I thought you said you wanted to also remove number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| Number four just addresses the sidewalk that connects the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| There are no sidewalks in the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| In the current subdivision, but not the proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| The proposed subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| There are no sidewalks in that subdivision?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| Commissioner Clancy said the only, condition number four referred to the sidewalk that would have been built within that easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2179)|
| 0:36:28| only the connection between the two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| I still agree with Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| I think it's nice to have those connectivities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2199)|
| 0:36:43| Are we ready to vote, Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| We have an amended motion by Commissioner Clancy to approve the concept plan subject to six conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2206)|
| 0:36:54| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2217)|
| 0:36:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2218)|
| 0:37:00| Was there four no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Is that what I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Motion to approve the development plan for up to 46 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| and a requested reduction of the peripheral setback to 25 feet as identified on the concept plan, subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2233)|
| 0:37:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Smith, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2243)|
| 0:37:28| To approve the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I see no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2251)|
| 0:37:32| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2253)|
| 0:37:34| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2254)|
| 0:37:36| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| We're on to agenda item number 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2261)|
| 0:37:49| This is under subdivision report concept use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2269)|
| 0:37:54| Subdivision is Dorchester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| Applicant is Messina Investments, LLC, Masada, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| Location is the west side of Carpenter Road, northwest of Patriot Way, north of West Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2283)|
| 0:38:10| The approximate acreage is 19.46 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| The zoning is PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| Existing land use is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| And the proposed use is detached residential subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| Number of lots is 70.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| And there are four subdivision variances required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2308)|
| 0:38:39| This does not include five waivers that have been approved by Knox County Department of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2319)|
| 0:38:49| Staff recommendation is to approve variances one through four because the existing access strip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| and site conditions restrict compliance with the subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| And the proposed variances will not create a traffic hazard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| Also, to approve the concept plan subject to 11 conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| and to approve the development plan for up to 70 detached dwellings on individual lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2349)|
| 0:39:14| and the requested reduction of the peripheral setback to 20 feet as identified on the concept plan subject to one condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2354)|
| 0:39:22| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Applicant, would you like to go first or opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2369)|
| 0:39:41| Write down your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| You guys are quick learners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| My name is Betty Hatmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| I live at 7714 Carpenter Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| I live just above where the proposed subdivision is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| I have a comment to make, and then I probably need a response from you before I continue with my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2394)|
| 0:39:59| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| I sent Tom Brecko an e-mail message on August the 28th concerning the signage requirements for the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2402)|
| 0:40:13| And he told me that it should be posted at least 15 days prior to the use on review meeting, which is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2413)|
| 0:40:20| That afternoon, the required MPC hearing sign was placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| However, it was placed at 7621 Carpenter Road, not 7509 Carpenter Road where the subdivision is planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2423)|
| 0:40:31| On September the 3rd, after the owner of the property of 7621 Carpenter Road called, I'm not sure who they called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2431)|
| 0:40:39| but they either called, look how they called Tom, the sign was removed and placed at the correct location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2439)|
| 0:40:46| So the required 15 days, did it start from the very first sign that was placed in the incorrect place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2446)|
| 0:40:57| or did it start from the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| The 15 days are counted backward from the date of this meeting, and so that would have been the end of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2461)|
| 0:41:10| But it was placed at the wrong sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| The sign requirement is a requirement in the Planning Commission's administrative rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| It's not a statutory requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2477)|
| 0:41:20| So the Planning Commission has delegated the authority to continue to hear the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2480)|
| 0:41:28| or to postpone it because of the placement of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| The sign is only one of the means that we use to notify neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2491)|
| 0:41:35| We send postcards to the owners of the surrounding properties within 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| There's a legal ad in the newspaper, which is the only statutory requirement for notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2500)|
| 0:41:45| There's also the Planning Commission's agenda, which goes up several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| The preliminary agenda is several weeks before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| So our stance, and I don't mean to lead the commission, they have the ability to postpone if they so desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2512)|
| 0:41:59| because of the placement of the sign in the wrong place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| But our typical stance is that due to the various methods of notification to neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2521)|
| 0:42:08| no one is dominant other than the statutory requirement for the legal ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| That's the only one that would mandate a postponement of the hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| I'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| Per the MPC policies and guidelines, it's stated that the use on review request should be compatible with the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| not injure value of property, and not substantially increase the level of traffic into the neighborhood when completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2548)|
| 0:42:35| Firstly, the neighbors of Carpenter Road know that an additional 70 homes on our rural road will impact each of the above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2555)|
| 0:42:41| But more importantly, the safety of our families and anyone traveling Carpenter Road will be endangered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2561)|
| 0:42:47| The level of traffic on Carpenter Road has significantly increased since the developer first asked for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2567)|
| 0:42:52| and received approval for the subdivision in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| Subdivisions and trailer parks on adjacent roads have caused an increase in the level of traffic on Carpenter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2575)|
| 0:43:02| A proposed plan for a traffic light at Emory will cause an additional increase in traffic on both Carpenter and Harold Roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2582)|
| 0:43:08| because this will be the only easy out in an already heavily traveled Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2588)|
| 0:43:14| Secondly, this is a rural community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| Home appraisals range from $46,000 to $801,000 with all types of home, mobile homes and residential homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| Per the website, and this is when Smithville was noted as the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| home prices range from the mid $100s to $200s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| Scott Davis, the owner of the property at 7509 Carpenter, responded to an email query I sent on August the 28th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2613)|
| 0:43:40| However, a subsequent email regarding planned requirements improvements for Carpenter Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2620)|
| 0:43:45| for the proposed subdivision south of the Carpenter Ridge subdivision was not provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2625)|
| 0:43:50| According to the KMP's document Working Together for Community Growth found on the website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| the developer showed renderings of the proposed development, share architectural styles, etc. to help earn the neighbors' trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2635)|
| 0:44:02| The developer has done none of these things, which indicates to us that he is not willing to work with residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| Keith Pratt from TDOT was contacted regarding any traffic counts or studies that have been conducted on Carpenter Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| as it is the feeder road into West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| The reply from the staff employee, Karen Watts, stated that the state of Tennessee does not have a traffic count on Carpenter Road in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2658)|
| 0:44:25| We conducted traffic counts on three separate days, three separate times for an hour each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2665)|
| 0:44:31| Approximately between 1,100 and 1,200 vehicles passed east and west on Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2671)|
| 0:44:37| Approximately 120 vehicles turning right onto Harrell Road from eastbound Emory and turning left on Harrell Road from westbound Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2677)|
| 0:44:46| Those were not counted in Emory Road counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| And approximately 100 vehicles turning into or out of Carpenter Road from or to Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2689)|
| 0:44:55| Dates and times were conducted was August 27 from 4 to 5 p.m., August 28 from 6.30 to 7.30 a.m., and August 29 from 7.22 to 8.22 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2695)|
| 0:45:06| Counts were conducted in the parking lot of the market and barbershop facing West Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| This data proves that the traffic on this rural road is already high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| and adding 749 more trips on Carpenter from the subdivision is a significant increase with all the inherent hazards that it increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2714)|
| 0:45:23| I have videos that I have provided to this gentleman here that we have taken, if you would like to view those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2723)|
| 0:45:32| We have measured certain places on Carpenter Road where there are significant drop-offs on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2732)|
| 0:45:39| where it's hard for two vehicles to pass each other without one of them pulling into a driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2739)|
| 0:45:44| The measurements are between the proposed subdivision south to Carpenter Ridge subdivision toward Emory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2744)|
| 0:45:49| Measurements are-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| Ma'am, you have 30 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Well, there's 15 feet, 17 feet, 16 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| And I would like to conclude we have concerns regarding Eagle Bend and Messina's business practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2758)|
| 0:46:06| According to the information obtained from the Knox County Property Records Database,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| Eagle Bend owes almost $23,000 in back taxes, and Messina owes $21,000 in back taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2770)|
| 0:46:16| We don't know if he has enough money to even start this and complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2776)|
| 0:46:22| So we have that fear because he went bankrupt at one time and lost this property and bought it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2782)|
| 0:46:28| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Would the applicant like to reply?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| Well, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2797)|
| 0:46:44| For the record, I've never been bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| For the record, I may owe some back taxes, but I probably own, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| how many hundreds and hundreds of different lots scattered out everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| If I owe back taxes, I'll make sure they're brought current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2812)|
| 0:46:56| I didn't realize there was going to be opposition here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2816)|
| 0:46:58| and also to keep this body from having to make a decision as it relates to an error we made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| I've owned this property since, I think, 2005 or 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| An extra 30 days isn't going to kill me by any stretch of the imagination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| I'd be glad to meet with the homeowners to address their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| I will also make sure we put the sign in the proper location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| At one point, there was two access points to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| We sold off a piece of that, and we inadvertently put the sign in the incorrect access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| and when Mr. Bresco called, we immediately went out and did move the sign back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2849)|
| 0:47:32| but we did put it in the wrong place, and we erred when we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2852)|
| 0:47:36| So I respectfully request that this body, which you don't hear me say very often,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2856)|
| 0:47:41| is a 30-day postponement to address the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2861)|
| 0:47:46| but also I take great offense to anyone standing up at this podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| questioning my work ethic, questioning the way I conduct my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| I don't take that lightly, and I would like to have that stricken from the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| because what was said was 100% false, incorrect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| and a terrible, terrible castation of me as an individual, and I do not appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| Can I respond, Kathleen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| I have the backup documentation from Knox County Property Records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2893)|
| 0:48:22| Sir, are you speaking in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| I'm in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| The opposition had a total of five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2907)|
| 0:48:29| We have already heard the full five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2909)|
| 0:48:34| I have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Okay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| I explained at the beginning of our meeting the way the meeting is conducted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| that the opposition gets a total of five minutes, not each person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| However, Commissioner Buston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2933)|
| 0:48:55| Madam Chair, could you please allow more minutes for the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2935)|
| 0:49:01| Five minutes, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| We're going to give the opposition five more minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| and Mr. Davis, we'll also add time to your clock if necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2944)|
| 0:49:09| But, sir, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2949)|
| 0:49:12| My name is Bill Gwinn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Address is 7550 Napa Valley Way, Knoxville, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| And before we start your timer, would you mind writing down your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2964)|
| 0:49:25| I have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| I'm here to represent the residents of Napa Valley Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| or the impact of the approval of the Dorchester development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| without considering our safety, our financial impact, our privacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2977)|
| 0:49:43| and the well-being of our homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| Now, first, I want you to understand that we are not here to try to stop this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| We believe that a person has the right to develop his own property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| and I personally would defend to the death his right to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| But I'd like to give you some background on Alicia Vineyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| It's a unique subdivision, and it backs up directly to this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3002)|
| 0:50:08| Our residents are mostly elderly, retired, some veterans, and many disabled individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3008)|
| 0:50:16| There are a number of single elderly ladies living there alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3016)|
| 0:50:21| and most of us move there because we believe that this would be a safe place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3021)|
| 0:50:25| to spend the final years of our life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3025)|
| 0:50:28| The gated community gives us peace of mind and a place to walk safely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3028)|
| 0:50:33| tend our small landscape lots, and for those who live on the backside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| which is the most impacted portion of the subdivision by this proposed development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3036)|
| 0:50:42| gives us the pristine fields and woodland that we're accustomed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3042)|
| 0:50:51| When we realized that this initiative was proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| it came as a surprise and a distress, all of us, for our safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| a certain appreciation of the value of our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| because I'm sure you know the difference in the value of the proposed subdivision property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3066)|
| 0:51:11| and that in Alicia Vineyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| This, ladies and gentlemen, Alicia Vineyard is a, I would call it a vulnerable community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3075)|
| 0:51:21| because the development opens up the entire backside of Alicia Vineyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| to construction dust, noise, and when it's completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| anyone who wants to walk into our subdivision would be free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| Forgive my raspy voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3095)|
| 0:51:36| I've been in a hyperbaric chamber at UT for 40 days, and it left me hoarsened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3096)|
| 0:51:41| and I'll try to be distinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| We residents request that the Nock County Planning Commission add a restriction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3105)|
| 0:51:52| requiring a physical barrier of evergreens such as Leyland cypress trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3112)|
| 0:51:56| This barrier should extend along the entire common property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| in order to provide safety and security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| and a sound barrier which residents thought they were purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| when they bought into Alicia Vineyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| I wholeheartedly invite all of you to come see what I cannot express verbally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3130)|
| 0:52:16| and that is the difference in the elevation between the proposed subdivision and Alicia Vineyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3136)|
| 0:52:23| The best way I can describe it is that Dorchester is on the hill looking down on us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| and we're in a valley looking up, and it's not going to be a very pleasant situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| The group desires that the Planning Commission approval be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3157)|
| 0:52:43| until the impact of this proposal on the existing community can be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| in a manner to protect us and our investment from potential injury of this action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| and we will withdraw our objection if we can have these restrictions placed on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3173)|
| 0:53:02| One final note, and I'll shut up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| We didn't create this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| We're the victims of the problem, and it's interfering with our lifestyle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| It's interfering with our investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| and we think that the person who created this should be the one to resolve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| and we think he should be the one to build a barrier to give us peace and quiet in our old age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3197)|
| 0:53:23| I'm 90 years old, and my wife is 88, and when we moved there, she said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| this is the last move I'll ever make, but now I don't know whether it will be or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3207)|
| 0:53:33| because I don't think we can stand the mess that's going to be created by this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| Thank you very much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| I appreciate you bringing those comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| and also being the representative of that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| I know that in the past there has been conditions of landscape barriers, and at what point is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3226)|
| 0:53:56| I know Mr. Davis has requested postponement, so that's an action before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| The Planning Commission can require some landscape buffer and work with Mr. Davis and the designers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3240)|
| 0:54:06| on providing that landscape barrier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3246)|
| 0:54:08| In response to Mr. Nguyen, was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| Nguyen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| Nguyen, your comment about evaluating the impact of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| and the land use on your existing subdivision, the property is already zoned for this type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3256)|
| 0:54:23| so that evaluation was done when the zoning occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| Mr. Davis has the right under the zoning to develop the properties he's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| without further evaluation of the impact of that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| What we can look at now are design features such as the landscape area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| but again, the evaluation of the impact of development of this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| has been addressed when the property was zoned plan residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3285)|
| 0:54:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Mr. Davis, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| We've got several commission lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3298)|
| 0:55:12| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| I appreciate your all's time, and if we postpone for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| you'll give us a chance to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| I tried to respond to the e-mails that were sent to me, and I did respond to the phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| I was not aware that they desired to meet, which was never brought to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3323)|
| 0:55:28| As you all know, I've been doing this for a long time, and I try to meet with the residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3328)|
| 0:55:31| I try to do what I can to appease, and I'll be glad to do so over the next 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| and we can re-address this in 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3335)|
| 0:55:37| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Commissioner Rock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| I waited for that precise opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| I mentioned this on Tuesday, and I asked the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| and I just want to get it on the record that a traffic stay is not required at this time with this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3349)|
| 0:55:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| Mr. Breschke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| They're proposing 70 lots, and 71 is what generates the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| It's 750 trips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3367)|
| 0:56:09| There is a condition that was proposed that any additional development of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3369)|
| 0:56:14| even one additional lot, would require that traffic impact analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| Right, and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| And there is some wording in this, and I appreciate Mr. Davis asking to postpone this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| because of the misplacement of the sign, even though he doesn't have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| But there is wording here that in all of our rulings, when we're looking at these plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| that they have to comply with city and county engineering, whoever the appropriate authority is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| And I'd just like to point out to the people that when that kicks in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| the developer has to do what engineering recommends to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3407)|
| 0:56:50| So if we were going to vote on this today, we would still be saying to Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| you still have to comply with engineering requirements as far as traffic and roads and all that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| So I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| Yeah, I just was trying to hear in all of the opposition some good arguments about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| where we are now, the concept plan being inappropriate, and I haven't really heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| I know the gentleman that lives on Napa Valley Way, I know it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| not comforting to have something change directly behind your house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| but, you know, as I pulled up the historic aerials on this side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| and the condos on Napa Valley were built in 2010,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| and they went in directly behind the other neighborhood on Ridgewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3454)|
| 0:57:38| So it's like, you know, nobody wants to have somebody in their backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| but your condos were built in somebody else's backyard, and it's just the nature of growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3462)|
| 0:57:48| And, you know, I hate that, but I hope that you guys can get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| and come to some mutual understandings to where you're a little more at ease with everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| That's right. That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| Thank you. Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| I'm going to make a motion to postpone, but before I do, I would like to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| Mr. Gwynne, if you and your neighborhood would get together with Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3491)|
| 0:58:15| he's usually pretty easy to get along with, and he wants a good development just as well as anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3495)|
| 0:58:24| I think you all will find that you can come to some kind of agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| And I'd also like to say that unless there's proof that she's got written proof that he went bankrupt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| that's slander, and I think it should be stricken from a record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| I rarely agree with Mr. Davis, but I do in that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| and I would be upset if somebody said that in a public forum that went on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| I just think it was ill-advised and not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| So I will make a motion that we postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy, a second by Commissioner Roth to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3534)|
| 0:58:59| We still do have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3539)|
| 0:59:01| Commissioner Buston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3542)|
| 0:59:04| Mr. Davis, thank you so much for agreeing to meet with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| and I try to work some of these things out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| You know that the last few years, the time I've been on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3551)|
| 0:59:15| we have continually tried to see that that collaboration works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3555)|
| 0:59:21| because, number one, you always come up with a better plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| and you try to work with the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| and I really applaud you for doing that and continue to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| because everybody kind of wants to know what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3573)|
| 0:59:37| and when you're transparent, everybody seems to get alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| I know you're going to have some opposition because that's just part of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3581)|
| 0:59:44| There's always people that have, you know, they use fear, they're scared of change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3584)|
| 0:59:50| but I just keep wanting to say thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| and please, Ms. Hatmaker and Mr. Guinn, you guys work with Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3594)|
| 1:00:01| and I guarantee you he'll make some of those concessions for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3601)|
| 1:00:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| Yes, ma'am. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3608)|
| 1:00:09| Ma'am, if you want to make a comment, we'd like to hear that, but come to the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| I would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| I did not state anything that I did not have documentation for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| Commissioner Canty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| It's my first time speaking, but I'm just curious again, out of curiosity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| I'm not asking everybody who is in opposition to speak, but I guess just a raise of hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| who in this room is in opposition of this again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3639)|
| 1:00:43| We do have a motion on the table by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3643)|
| 1:00:46| seconded by Commissioner Phillips to postpone for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| I see no other lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3649)|
| 1:00:51| I'm assuming you're not wanting to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3654)|
| 1:00:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3658)|
| 1:00:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| I think we need to go through the second two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3660)|
| 1:01:03| Is that correct, the concept plan to postpone and the development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3663)|
| 1:01:10| I think that we need to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Motion to postpone the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| The concept plan first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3674)|
| 1:01:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Do we need to do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| So we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| a second by Commissioner Roth to postpone the concept plan for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3683)|
| 1:01:28| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3691)|

| 1:03:59| And it sounded like four, but it was only three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3839)|
| 1:04:02| It sounded like about a half dozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=3845)|

| 1:10:07| Based on that, I will make a motion to adopt resolution 9-B-19-SP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4207)|
| 1:10:13| amending the northwest county sector plan to MDR O medium density residential office per attached resolution exhibit A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4213)|
| 1:10:23| And, again, your reasoning for the sector plan amendment was which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| It's going to be the logical extension of the development and changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4235)|
| 1:10:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| Further resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4239)|
| 1:10:41| a second by Commissioner Buston to adopt a resolution to amend the northwest county sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4241)|
| 1:10:49| I see no lights, no one at the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4251)|
| 1:10:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4252)|
| 1:10:53| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4253)|
| 1:10:54| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| Motion to approve OB office medical and related services zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4256)|
| 1:11:01| We have a motion by Commissioner Phillips, a second by Commissioner Buston to approve the OB zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4269)|
| 1:11:10| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4270)|
| 1:11:11| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| We are on to item number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4278)|
| 1:11:32| This is a rezoning report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| The second is Ball Homes, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| The location is the north side of Old Andes Road, north of Andes Road, west of Chert Pit Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| Approximate size of the tract is 30 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4308)|
| 1:11:53| Present zoning is A, agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4313)|
| 1:11:56| Zoning requested, PR, planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4316)|
| 1:12:01| The existing land use is vacant and the proposed use is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4321)|
| 1:12:06| The density proposed is five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Staff recommendation is to approve planned residential up to 2.5 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4331)|
| 1:12:18| The applicant requested five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| Yes, Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| Is there opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| Would you like to go first or the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| I'd just like to say a few things and then leave time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| We would like to request that you all approve this at a density of 3.5 units to the acre instead of the five that I applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4360)|
| 1:12:48| And I think that's consistent with the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| This property is already designated for low-density residential, which allows up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4371)|
| 1:12:58| It is also in the growth policy area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| In addition, I've read through some e-mails that were sent to MPC staff and then were forwarded to me from staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4382)|
| 1:13:09| A lot of it seemed to be concerned around traffic around this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| As part of the planned residential planning, we'll be required to bring a concept plan back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| Part of that will have to have a traffic impact study conducted for this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| and we are prepared to make any improvements needed that comes from the traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4405)|
| 1:13:32| If I could, I'll just reserve the rest of my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4414)|
| 1:13:35| And I did see a number of hands going up for opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| And do you folks have a spokesperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| No, because, you know, we just got here and we don't know that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4422)|
| 1:13:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4426)|
| 1:13:47| My name is Felicia Slatter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| I live at 1641 Meadowchase Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| There's three of us that came prepared to present today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| I know I have about five minutes, but I also want to make sure that the rest of the opposition does have an opportunity to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4433)|
| 1:13:58| Could we please give them ten minutes, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| Ten minutes total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| So, okay, so total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| Did you hear that, folks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4452)|
| 1:14:13| Total, ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4453)|
| 1:14:14| Do you want me to give a warning at a three-minute for each?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| We can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| We'll manage it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| Awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| All right, once again, my name is Felicia Slatter, East 1641 Meadowchase Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| I represent the Atlee Fields homeowners directly adjacent to the property in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| I would like my neighbors to raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| All those in opposition, please raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| On behalf of those in our neighborhood, we respectfully and strongly urge you to deny the rezoning request from Ag to PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4479)|
| 1:14:45| until serious issues and concerns are addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| We have three reasons for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| They include adverse and dangerous traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| Number two, it's out of character for the density of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4492)|
| 1:14:55| And number three, there are environmental impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| Number one, I want to address the adverse and dangerous traffic issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4497)|
| 1:14:59| The intersection of Chirk Pit and Andes Road is a dangerous intersection that we believe cannot handle the additional traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4499)|
| 1:15:05| that will result from this rezoning, even at 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| There is a precedent for this argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| This issue was previously addressed by the MPC, Item 75, on December 8, 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| Partially on the basis of this dangerous intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Fuller's group rezoning request from Ag to PR on Andes Road was denied at the proposed density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| This intersection is more dangerous now than it was in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4524)|
| 1:15:28| and there have been no improvements to this intersection since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| Any additional traffic that would travel from Old Andes Road through Andes Road intersecting at Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4532)|
| 1:15:37| presents considerable risk as there is a steep hill at the corner of Andes prior to the stop sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| Dense traffic will also cause those making left turns on Middlebrook Pike considerable backup to Old Andes Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4542)|
| 1:15:47| because there is no dedicated left turn lane and simply cannot support the additional traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| Old Andes Road, the property on which the 30-acre requested rezoning to PR is located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| is a narrow, one-third mile long, one-lane road that cannot handle the increased traffic that this rezoning will bring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| The 26-foot right-of-way on Old Andes Road is insufficient for the improvements envisioned by the 2030 Knox County Growth Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| which identifies improved street standards that call for lanes with widths of 18 to 22 feet, curbs and gutters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| planting strips, and 5-foot sidewalks on at least one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| Streets with widths of 24 to 26 feet, curbs, gutters, planting strips, and 5-foot sidewalks on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4582)|
| 1:16:28| To require this of developers and then allow them to dump that traffic from their subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| onto a completely unimproved 13-foot wide surface with hills, curves, and adjacent draining dishes is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4593)|
| 1:16:41| A garbage truck recently was forced off the road and flipped over on its side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4601)|
| 1:16:47| because of the tiny approximately 10 feet of clear width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4607)|
| 1:16:51| This is just not in accordance with the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| Similarly, the increase in traffic on the 16-foot wide Andes Road is unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Improvements to both Andes Road and Old Andes Road and their intersections with Chert Pit and Middlebrook Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4618)|
| 1:17:03| need to be made prior to the rezoning of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4623)|
| 1:17:05| and increases in traffic that will make these improvements even more difficult than they will be with existing traffic flows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4625)|
| 1:17:11| Secondly, this is out of character for the density of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4631)|
| 1:17:14| We actually have a graph for you that one of our neighbors will be handing out to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4634)|
| 1:17:19| and I'll ask to draw your attention to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4639)|
| 1:17:22| Essentially, this proposed zoning from ag to PR is out of character for this density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4642)|
| 1:17:28| is out of character for the neighborhood and the current densities in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4648)|
| 1:17:31| If you see here, Atlee Fields, which is the neighborhood I represent, we're at 1.74 DUAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4651)|
| 1:17:36| Andy's Place is at 2.14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| The surrounding ag homes are at minus one per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4658)|
| 1:17:42| And this proposed development, now they're asking, staff said 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| They said 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| That's still at 2.5 too big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| It just will not represent the neighborhood, and the density is too thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| Further, Eubanks Chapel Cemetery is located on Old Andy's Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| and is listed as a Tennessee physical, cultural, and historic feature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| This is a 100-plus-year-old cemetery that was used very recently, even for a burial event in very recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4685)|
| 1:18:13| Let's talk about the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| There's a potential environmental issue resulting from interruption of natural water flow of an intermittent stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4694)|
| 1:18:19| crossing the surface of the adjacent property and below the surface of the property seeking rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| Drainage of water supply runoff is a major concern that requires further study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| You may recall the extreme flooding this past spring on Cedar Bluff Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| This is in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| We fear that Middlebrook Pike may have the same fate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4712)|
| 1:18:35| The hilly 30-acre property Ball Homes is seeking to rezone includes two farm ponds and 100 feet of elevation change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| The disturbance caused by the development of this property at the proposed density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| will have an overly negative environmental impact on the property of homeowners directly downstream in the Meadow Creek Ball Camp area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4725)|
| 1:18:52| Finally, we are concerned for the habitat of the wildlife that has been living on this parcel for decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4732)|
| 1:18:56| Did you know we have a cow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| Betsy Valentine is her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| She lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Where's she going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Finally, in conclusion, we recommend the subject property be approved for single-family housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| at no greater than one dwelling unit per acre with the understanding that the road infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4745)|
| 1:19:10| and environmental impact studies must be conducted and examined before approval of any such rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| As residents of the Atlee Field subdivision, we are concerned about the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| and ask the Board to deny such a request from Ag to PR until these studies are executed and evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4759)|
| 1:19:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4765)|
| 1:19:26| The remaining folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Frank Fusco, did you want to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| I was going to say I've got two and a half minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4772)|
| 1:19:35| I get two and a half minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4775)|
| 1:19:37| There's five minutes left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4777)|
| 1:19:38| You share five minutes and nine seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| Anyways, Frank Fusco, 1513, 1523, and 1517 Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4781)|
| 1:19:47| And can I stop the clock while I hand out these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4787)|
| 1:19:50| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4790)|
| 1:19:51| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4791)|
| 1:19:58| Some must have been on vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| So it all really boils down to the road for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| There's some other objections, but I'm going to concentrate just on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| You know, listen to all the arguments on the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4809)|
| 1:20:11| It kind of goes down about the roads and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| But this particular road is really nasty, nasty in terms of how wide it is and some dangerous intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4814)|
| 1:20:24| And so as you look on your papers there, there's a couple of pictures there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4824)|
| 1:20:28| There's actually a diagram of all the measurements that I took all through Andes Road there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4828)|
| 1:20:34| And you can see we're as low as 14.6 on some roadways up to 19.7, which is right at Andes and Chert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4834)|
| 1:20:44| And when you make that right on Chert pit off of Andes, you literally cannot go right without pulling out into oncoming traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4844)|
| 1:20:53| It's always been an eyesore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| I've always been complaining, and nobody's fixed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4855)|
| 1:20:57| So my concern is why are we doing these developments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| I'm not against development, but can we fix the roads so they can at least handle two cars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| I mean, my truck is eight foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| If you look at one of those pictures there with the telephone pole, that right there is what, seven foot three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4869)|
| 1:21:21| The seventh is nine foot from the center lane to the side of the pole, to the edge of the telephone pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4881)|
| 1:21:32| My truck is eight foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| You're going to be hitting that guardrail, aren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| Well, the road is 16 foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| That's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| Yeah, nine foot to the side of the pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| So I literally, at that telephone pole, I can't go by there when another car is coming or I'm going to hit the telephone pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4903)|
| 1:21:50| Now, the same thing that's even worse is on this guardrail, I'm seven three from the center line to the side of the guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4910)|
| 1:21:59| I can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| I'm in the guardrail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| And I had called about that, and they said, well, there's not enough accidents on that road to improve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| Yeah, so, I mean, that's my group, my gripe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| And, you know, I'm just going to go with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| To keep us happy and to keep the – I'm not against building, you know, but it's got to be a win-win situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| So if you want to put all these houses on this road, then give me a road that I can drive on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| That's all I ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| That's, you know, not a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4951)|
| 1:22:34| And, you know, we all value that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| I mean, you people don't want to go home to a dangerous road that, you know, you've got to worry about getting knocked off the road every time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4956)|
| 1:22:41| I mean, I've got the same values you all have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| I just want a decent road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| So if you may, that's my objection, but give me a decent road before you put all these houses in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4965)|
| 1:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4973)|
| 1:22:54| I've got a handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4974)|
| 1:22:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4975)|
| 1:23:03| If you can wait until you're at the microphone so we can hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4983)|
| 1:23:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4989)|
| 1:23:16| Give me a second here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=4996)|
| 1:23:23| And your name and address before the clock starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| My name is Larry Northcutt, 1635 Old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5009)|
| 1:23:33| My property line is 260 feet, a little bit less from the subject property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| And did you write your name down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5019)|
| 1:23:42| I did already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5023)|
| 1:23:44| I did already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5024)|
| 1:23:45| Okay, perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5025)|
| 1:23:46| Since you've covered already a lot of my points, and Liz has seen, I think, my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| I've posted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Most of you have probably already read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| All I can really add is just point out that this commission did oppose the last development in that area of any significant size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5035)|
| 1:24:07| based on the intersection of Andes Road and Old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| They turned it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| That was in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5053)|
| 1:24:20| And Old Andes Road is, what, one-third mile long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| And the staff said 13 feet, but in spots it is 10 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| And you see from the pictures, Andes Road, I think the staff showed an average width,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| a little bit where there's some choke points, just discussed by my neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5076)|
| 1:24:42| And you see some pictures where I drove my F-150 truck six feet, eight inches wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5082)|
| 1:24:48| You can see it barely fits on one lane at some points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5088)|
| 1:24:53| Cars have to pull to the side for two cars to pass each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| And I guess on Andes Road, my concern, if the development does go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5099)|
| 1:25:04| hopefully at 2.5 or lower density, not the 3.5, that the developer be required to widen that road to two lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5104)|
| 1:25:15| at least from the point of the entrance to Andes Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5115)|
| 1:25:20| and leave the remainder of Old Andes Road as a one-way, one-lane road would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| Because part of Old Andes Road is, by waiver, only 13 feet wide right away, not 26 foot right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5126)|
| 1:25:37| as Liz pointed out in her staff review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5137)|
| 1:25:43| And one more thing on the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| Some of the letters that were submitted to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5146)|
| 1:25:49| at least one of them was from someone who has relatives in that cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5149)|
| 1:25:55| And there's this concern that they were opposed to this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| I don't know if they're here today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| But there was a letter submitted to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| And there was a funeral there within the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| And this is well over a hundred-year-old cemetery, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| You see on the last attachment where I've attached the rules regarding cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5173)|
| 1:26:19| a cemetery would have to be relocated or maybe walled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| And I'd like to have some agreement from the developer that they would protect that cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5183)|
| 1:26:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5193)|
| 1:26:34| Mr. Hickey, you have ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| Yes, so I would like to address first Old Andes Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| Obviously, that road would have to be improved to county engineering standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| brought up to acceptable standards to county engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| And I'm sure there may be improvements to Andes Road as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5214)|
| 1:26:57| I've had discussions with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5217)|
| 1:26:59| They say there's adequate right-of-way to construct a road to their standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| So we're well aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| I'm sure the traffic impact studies are going to identify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5226)|
| 1:27:09| We never assumed that we would be using a 13-foot wide road to serve a development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5229)|
| 1:27:14| So we're well aware of that, and we'll do the traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| and we're prepared to make the improvements out there that will need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| to make them comply with the current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| In relation to the cemetery, we've developed in other areas where there are cemeteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| and we will protect the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| Where is the cemetery on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| So right, it's kind of right there in the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| No, opposite corner, right below the pond, right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5262)|
| 1:27:47| There's a small cemetery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| So that little dark area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5270)|
| 1:27:54| Yeah, you can see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Yeah, right there in the chapel cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| So, yeah, we're prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| We'll protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| As far as surrounding density, if you all could pull out the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| and pull up what the zone density of the adjoining subdivisions were, I'd appreciate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5289)|
| 1:28:16| because they're not at one point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| So as you can see, everything surrounding the property right here in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5299)|
| 1:28:27| Can you pull up the actual zoning map?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| I don't know really what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| So there's the current zoning map of all the, if you zoom out, the surrounding properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5314)|
| 1:28:41| it looks like three units to the acre is what some of these folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5321)|
| 1:28:45| they live in a subdivision zoned at three units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| So I wanted to point that out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5329)|
| 1:28:53| In addition, anything about the environmental stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| we have hired S&ME to perform geotechnical and environmental engineering assessments out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5336)|
| 1:29:03| and they're currently doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| So we can include that at a concept plan stage and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5344)|
| 1:29:11| I don't have any more comments at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| I do have a question from county engineering with regards to the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| especially the intersection there with old Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5361)|
| 1:29:27| And I guess it's Andes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| There was a comment made that there was some planned improvements for that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5369)|
| 1:29:35| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| Aaron Fritz, county engineering, 205 West Baxter Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| We don't have anything currently in the books for that intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5381)|
| 1:29:45| It hasn't been identified in our safety study that we had done in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5385)|
| 1:29:49| It just hasn't risen to the top there, looking at countywide safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5389)|
| 1:29:55| If there is anything that is required that comes out of the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5395)|
| 1:29:58| I'm sure we'll work with Mr. Hickey to make that stuff happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Just to add and confirm what Mr. Hickey said and what Mr. Fritz said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| there will be at the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| this is the first step in development of this property with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| and the density that is determined to be appropriate for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| The concept plan would be the next stage at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| A traffic impact study would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5423)|
| 1:30:27| And Ms. Baird, do you know what intersections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5427)|
| 1:30:30| have you any idea what intersections would be addressed in that traffic study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| We have actually not addressed that just yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5435)|
| 1:30:37| So the actual transportation engineer for the developer applicant would have to contact us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5437)|
| 1:30:42| to figure that out and to find a scope for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5442)|
| 1:30:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| As part of that study, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5447)|
| 1:30:50| all affected intersections would be studied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5450)|
| 1:30:53| and there may be improvements required which the developer would be responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5453)|
| 1:30:58| As Mr. Hickey said, also required to protect the cemetery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| or otherwise address the cemetery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5463)|
| 1:31:06| The comment regarding the previous rezoning request in 2005,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5466)|
| 1:31:11| the planning commission recommended approval of that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| That was withdrawn prior to consideration by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5483)|
| 1:31:24| Commissioner Clancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5486)|
| 1:31:27| Liz, where did you come up with 2.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| If you'll look in your package, we ran a slope analysis on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5491)|
| 1:31:36| It falls within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5496)|
| 1:31:42| It was provided as a blue sheet at the Tuesday agenda review meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5502)|
| 1:31:54| It should be color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| Yeah, I saw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5517)|
| 1:31:58| So when we run a slope analysis on that, we just run the analysis for the area that is speckled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5518)|
| 1:32:05| That's where the hillside protection area is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| And we determined that based on the 30 acres and the degrees of slope that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5530)|
| 1:32:18| that 2.5 dwelling units an acre would be an appropriate density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5538)|
| 1:32:25| We also looked at what the surrounding densities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| Since the zoning allows up to three currently in many of those places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5549)|
| 1:32:36| we noted that although the build-out is lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| that up to 2.5 would be reasonable in keeping with the adjacent areas as well as the slope profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5561)|
| 1:32:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5575)|
| 1:32:59| I'd like to make a motion that we approve PR up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5579)|
| 1:33:05| We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by Commissioner Roth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5585)|
| 1:33:10| to approve up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| We do still have some lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| First, Commissioner Smith and then Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| I think that's about right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| You know, I know the safety issues of the neighbors with the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5603)|
| 1:33:27| and I think it's 71 lots you're required to do a traffic impact study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| 750 trips, which equates to about 71.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| Yeah, so anything less than that, and you wouldn't get the benefit of the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| which will probably result in the developer funding your road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| which should help things over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| And I think it's a good, fair density in light of the fact that Atlee Fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5625)|
| 1:33:50| and some of the surrounding neighbors have the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| So I'm supportive of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| At 2.5, there still would need to be a traffic study because there's 30 acres and that would be 75 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5637)|
| 1:34:04| So the traffic study would still be required at 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5644)|
| 1:34:07| Yeah, but I think that one of the opposition was talking like one and a half and two and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5647)|
| 1:34:15| So I think giving them three, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| they have a little more incentive and a little more room to generate funds to repair the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5658)|
| 1:34:23| and get the road up to snuff, so I think that's reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| Commissioner Graf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Yeah, I think on this one the staff has it exactly right, two and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| based on the slope analysis and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5674)|
| 1:34:38| So that's what I would be in favor of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5680)|
| 1:34:44| I see no other lights on unless Commissioner Clancy wanted to say something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| Okay, there is a motion on the floor to approve PR up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| That was a motion by Commissioner Clancy and a second by, I'm sorry, Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5695)|
| 1:35:01| The Clancy-Roth team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5706)|
| 1:35:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| Opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5708)|
| 1:35:09| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| No, opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5710)|

| 1:35:13| Four opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5713)|
| 1:35:14| No, one, two, three, four, five, six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| Let's vote again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| But I think the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5722)|
| 1:35:26| Do we need a voice count or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5726)|
| 1:35:29| We have five opposed, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| Six opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5731)|
| 1:35:32| Six opposed to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| Why don't you roll call that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5733)|
| 1:35:34| That's close enough to where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5734)|
| 1:35:39| What, do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5739)|
| 1:35:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| We're going to have Amy Brooks do roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| Commissioner Boyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5746)|

| 1:36:19| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| For those that are in the audience, as Mr. Green explained, this is rezoning at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5780)|
| 1:36:34| point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5794)|
| 1:36:35| This will come back before commission with a concept plan, in which case there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| obviously traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Mr. Hickey will be presenting what it's going to look like and what road improvements there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5808)|
| 1:36:49| And I appreciate you guys staying in contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| And Mr. Hickey, I'm assuming that you will reach out to the neighbors and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5811)|
| 1:36:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5815)|
| 1:36:56| I mean, none of them tried to contact me, but as part of the application, when I filed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5816)|
| 1:37:00| the rezoning, I mean, my email's on there, my address, and my cell phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| So, I mean, they have all my contact info.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| And this is in the county, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| Ms. Slatterly, I know that you said you were representing a homeowners association, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5831)|
| 1:37:16| maybe you guys could invite Mr. Hickey to your neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planningr399190912?start=5841)|
