| 0:00:48| with both legal decisions and actions that have taken place. Let there be respect for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=48)|
| 0:00:56| the rule of law that underpins our society so that we can live together and work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=56)|

| 0:01:09| perhaps shelter and a home to go to that they find a way to get care and that we reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=69)|
| 0:01:17| to them. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=77)|

| 0:02:25| Any opposed? The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=145)|
| 0:02:27| For the Mayor's report, first I want to welcome Boy Scout Troop 55 from Fountain City United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=147)|
| 0:02:34| Would you all please stand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=154)|
| 0:02:37| This is the Boy Scouts are working on citizenship and the community badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=157)|
| 0:02:42| So we are very happy that you're here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| And I understand you have one of you all will come and address us for a minute here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=164)|
| 0:02:51| Just please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| My name is Derek Sharp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| My rank is star. I'm their senior patrol leader.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| We are in from Fountain City United Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=178)|
| 0:03:03| And we are grateful to be here and hope to learn a lot. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=186)|
| 0:03:14| So for the Mayor's report, last Friday we had the Save Our Sons Summit at the Coliseum Ballroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| to bring together community members to talk about strategies for reducing violence-related deaths| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| among African-American and actually young men and boys of color| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| and increasing opportunities for their success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| We had a great turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| We had over 180 people from many different organizations, at least 65 or so different organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=214)|
| 0:03:41| I know several of our council members were there as well, and we appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| We had very good, frank discussion from everybody around the tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| and we had some very good speakers, including a really gripping keynote speech from Kwabena Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=229)|
| 0:03:57| a former gang member here in Knoxville who turned his life around after many years of being in and out of jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| He is now a homeowner, a registered voter, and an employee of Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| And he really had the courage to stand up and to share his story with us, and it's really a story of hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=249)|
| 0:04:15| And he's working now to help other young men in our community turn their lives around as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=255)|
| 0:04:20| So we are compiling all the notes from those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=260)|
| 0:04:24| and UT Swarps is actually helping to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| And so we will have a report, and then we'll use that data to continue to move towards developing a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| where we can set some targets and figure out where we can be most effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| in working together as a community on this very difficult issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| So I appreciate everyone's support and participation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| We had a lot of people who volunteered, but two of the key people were Jackie Clay and Janet Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| Janet Brewer at KPD and Jackie Clay in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| They just really did a lot of the detail work to pull this all together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=294)|
| 0:04:57| So we appreciate all of the planning committee, but particularly those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| This morning I participated in another event that is a product of another ongoing effort that we have been leading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| Mayor Brown, you were there too, weren't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=311)|
| 0:05:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=312)|
| 0:05:13| You were there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| The KUB Knoxville Utilities Board announced a new program called Round It Up, Pennies for a Purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=314)|
| 0:05:21| This came out of the Smarter Cities Partnership that formed last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| after a visit from the IBM Smarter Cities Challenge Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| That team was looking at ways to connect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=330)|
| 0:05:33| Well, the IBM people came in, and we had this team that was looking at ways to connect low-income residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=333)|
| 0:05:39| with resources to make their homes or apartments more energy efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| So with KUB's program, starting in April 2015, utility bills will be rounded up to the next dollar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=343)|
| 0:05:51| and the excess money will go fully to fund the weatherization program already run by CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| There's a long waiting list for the program, and KUB estimates that the Round It Up program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=358)|
| 0:06:03| could provide another $600,000 a year for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| It's strictly a voluntary program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| Anybody can opt out at any time by calling KUB or going to their website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| But, of course, we do hope that people will participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| The most any person would pay, when you think about that with the rounding up, would be just under $12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| would be the most that anybody might pay over the course of a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| Anyway, this is a really great, concrete result of the work being done by the Smarter Cities Partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=387)|
| 0:06:33| And also, this won't start actually until the spring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=393)|
| 0:06:38| so KUB and CAC and the city will spend the next several months educating people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=398)|
| 0:06:43| and make sure they know you're free to opt out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=403)|
| 0:06:45| You can opt out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=405)|
| 0:06:46| I believe you can go on the website if you don't want to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| But, again, we're hoping that people will continue to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=410)|
| 0:06:55| The whole idea here is that we spend a lot of money this time of year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| A lot of people donate to Project HELP and other programs to help people pay their utility bills during the winter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| The whole purpose of this program is to try and stop the Band-Aid approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| and actually do the weatherization of homes so there won't be high utility bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=430)|
| 0:07:17| So that's a real, I think, proactive approach to an ongoing problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=437)|
| 0:07:24| So I want to thank KUB and CAC for taking the initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| And I also want to thank Erin Gill and our Office of Sustainability for running the whole Smarter Cities process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=448)|
| 0:07:35| And now I want to talk about the holidays that are upon us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=455)|
| 0:07:38| The holiday season is officially here this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=458)|
| 0:07:41| And just a quick reminder that city offices will be closed on Thursday and Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| And we all hope everybody has a wonderful Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| And right after Thanksgiving, we start into Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| And that starts off on Friday, this Friday the 28th at 6 o'clock at Crouch Park downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| We'll have the lighting of the Christmas tree and the regal celebration of lights will begin for downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| There'll be music on Market Square along with the holidays on Ice Shrink that will be functioning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=486)|
| 0:08:12| and all sorts of entertainment and family activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=492)|
| 0:08:15| So that's this Friday at 6 o'clock right after Thanksgiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=495)|
| 0:08:19| And then the following Friday, December 5th, we have the annual WIVK Christmas Parade downtown starting at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=499)|
| 0:08:28| And even more events will be happening throughout the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=508)|
| 0:08:32| We invite you to go to thecityofknoxville.org slash Christmas for a full schedule of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=512)|
| 0:08:39| And there are a number of flyers and postings around town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=519)|
| 0:08:43| As always, I want to thank Judith Foltz and her team and special events for putting all of this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| That's no easy task when you look at all of the different events that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| In addition, folks from public service, police, fire, a lot of our city employees are involved in making this stuff happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=532)|
| 0:09:02| So we hope everybody has a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| They come down and enjoy the holidays together as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| And that is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=548)|
| 0:09:10| Are there reports from Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I would like to make a little statement concerning the events in Ferguson, Missouri.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| I know that Ferguson is a long ways from Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| but the incidents that have happened really has been a watershed moment in civil rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=565)|
| 0:09:31| and human rights history in this nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| I don't know if there are any protests or marches planned for Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| but I would encourage people to remember that in about a month we will be celebrating Dr. King Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=579)|
| 0:09:47| and Dr. King was about nonviolence and civil disobedience in a very peaceful way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=587)|
| 0:09:55| So I want to encourage our citizens, if they're planning to march or demonstrate, to remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=595)|
| 0:10:02| And I want to keep in our prayers the people in Ferguson, Missouri,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=602)|
| 0:10:08| and I want to commend you, Mayor, for having the Save Our Sons Summit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=608)|
| 0:10:15| and also our police force here for the community relations that they are engaging in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| But I felt that something needed to be said about that situation in Ferguson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Any other reports from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Okay, we'll go on to elections and confirmations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| A resolution confirming the reappointment of Jim Richards to the Knoxville Transportation Authority Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=638)|
| 0:10:44| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=644)|
| 0:10:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| I believe that Mr. Richards is out there in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| Would you like to stand for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| I appreciate you serving your first term, and you're willing to serve another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| Thank you so much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=660)|

| 0:13:19| But I had a question, I don't know if it's for the Chief or the Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| Will we have some kind of signage that might post this so that people won't claim surprise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=804)|
| 0:13:31| I mean, everyone's presumed to know the law, but do you know that you're supposed to be 20 feet away from an entrance or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=811)|
| 0:13:38| I don't know if we need a sign somewhere or several locations that might apprise folks of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| Typically what we do, Councilman, is when we enact new ordinances or adjust ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| we'll have a period of basically training of our citizens where the officers will give warnings before they give citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=832)|

| 0:15:31| but maybe we could get Becky Wade just to give us a nickel's worth of what we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=931)|

| 0:15:47| All of the properties that are listed here this evening were listed in our Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| That's our program that we use to dispose of properties that the city owns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=952)|
| 0:15:58| and part of the process is that whoever purchases these properties is given a time limit to begin construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=958)|
| 0:16:07| to rehabilitate the structure, and then a time limit to complete it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| And if that doesn't happen, then we have the ability to take the property back from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=973)|
| 0:16:20| So it ensures that the work is done, it's done in a timely manner, and we do monitor throughout the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=980)|

| 0:19:08| And reinsurance, if you think about it, is insurance for insurance companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1148)|
| 0:19:14| The city is self-insured on all its medical claims, but we don't we try and cap our risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1154)|
| 0:19:21| and we do that through reinsurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| And what this proposal is is it's, if you think of it like a deductible, we have a deductible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| For $250,000 on a medical claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| And for anything above that, reinsurance kicks in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1180)|

| 0:23:23| Jim, if you'll visit us once more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1403)|
| 0:23:25| Come on down, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Why is he sitting in the back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| He knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| It's kind of technical with all the talk about LIBOR and so many basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| but just give us the essence of how you're saving us money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1417)|
| 0:23:42| which is the wonderful news of this storyline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| and whether that's better than paying off the debt some way or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| Just give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| How much are we saving, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1433)|
| 0:23:54| $81,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1434)|
| 0:23:55| Using current numbers, we would save $81,000 in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| That could potentially go down in subsequent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1440)|
| 0:24:03| It could also go up depending on what happens to LIBOR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| So the city has two bond issues that are variable rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1448)|
| 0:24:14| and we are extending the index period on one of those for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1454)|
| 0:24:19| And in exchange for extending that period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| we are getting a reduction in the interest rate that we pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| So that was the bargaining chip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| You give them two more years of business and they lower the cost to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| We'd be happy to do that ad infinitum as long as we can keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| Well, thank you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil141125?start=1475)|
