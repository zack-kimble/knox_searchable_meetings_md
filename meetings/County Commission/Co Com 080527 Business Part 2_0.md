| 0:01:43| You just did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=103)|
| 0:01:44| Oh, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=104)|
| 0:01:46| 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=106)|
| 0:01:48| 103 is honoring the volunteers of the five citizen review panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=108)|

| 0:02:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=124)|
| 0:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| Mr. Chairman, we have several of those citizens here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| I would like for them to stand and maybe come down and be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=131)|
| 0:02:14| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| I think we lost several of them in the last couple of hours, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=136)|
| 0:02:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=145)|
| 0:02:35| These citizens started in last fall with about 10 to 14 hours of meetings depending on what panel they served on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=155)|
| 0:02:41| We broke them up into five panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=161)|
| 0:02:43| And then most of them spent between 30 and 40 hours working, reviewing the applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=163)|
| 0:02:50| and sitting through hearings with the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=170)|
| 0:02:53| I would like for them all to come to this podium and maybe a couple of them who chair committees may want to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=173)|
| 0:03:07| Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity, Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=187)|
| 0:03:10| Donna McEvers, 12630 Early Drive, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| I had the pleasure to serve as the chairperson on the social services panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=196)|
| 0:03:22| We reviewed 41 grant applications, and with the time at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| I would estimate that we all probably spent 40 to 50 hours, including the meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=208)|
| 0:03:34| We took it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=214)|
| 0:03:37| I was really honored to have been able to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| I did want to say very quickly that I hope all of you commissioners will let our recommendations stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=220)|
| 0:03:50| and there will not be any changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=230)|
| 0:03:52| We worked very hard, and it was a very fair and open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=232)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=237)|
| 0:04:00| 103, page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Mark Hancock, 1108 Montview Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| I wanted to just echo what she had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| I was not a chairman of one of these panels, but it was an honor to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| I enjoyed doing it, and I appreciate the ability to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| One of the things that we had to do in looking over this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=263)|
| 0:04:29| we were originally told we were going to have about twice as much in taxpayer dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| to allocate to all of these nonprofit organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| All of them, we felt, were very deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| But we had to rank them based upon what their application said, how complete it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| what they did when they came in front of us to speak to us in presenting their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=291)|
| 0:04:59| And I serve on several boards of directors of nonprofits that did not get funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=299)|
| 0:05:05| not people that came in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=305)|
| 0:05:09| but because our panels were divided up among youth and tourism and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=309)|
| 0:05:16| And I'm upset as a board of directors member that some of the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| some of the organizations that I serve on did not get funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=321)|
| 0:05:26| I know that it's your job to legislate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=326)|
| 0:05:29| and to make additions or deletions or corrections or whatever to what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=329)|
| 0:05:37| But I would remind the Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| just in case I happen not to be here when you do consider it, and I hope that I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| And I think I speak for virtually every one of the people on these panels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| that we did work very hard to come up with the most deserving people to get these grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=349)|
| 0:05:56| And a lot of them that did get funded only got funded at a certain percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| of what they were requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| In doing so, we did have to cut out a lot of things that as were done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=368)|
| 0:06:14| There were a lot of organizations that had been funded for years that did not get any funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=374)|
| 0:06:21| I do hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=381)|
| 0:06:23| In what you do, however, that you will consider the fact that what is being presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| when it is presented, and I think that will be in about next month or the next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| that it will reflect what the panel did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| The mayor did not change anything, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=398)|
| 0:06:41| And I've reviewed it from what we did, from what all these panels did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| And I hope that you will consider that and preserve the integrity of the process that if you do decide to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=408)|
| 0:06:55| organizations that we decided not to fund based upon their ranking, that you also consider the fact that you may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| taking away from organizations that all of our panels thought were deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| That if you're going to move up someone that may be at the bottom of the list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=430)|
| 0:07:15| that you consider also the others that did not get funded that might have been ahead of those on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| Again, thank you for the opportunity to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| And I hope that we will all be looking forward to seeing how this comes out when the budget is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=445)|
| 0:07:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=453)|
| 0:07:39| I'm Martha Arnold Sharnay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=459)|
| 0:07:41| I appreciate the opportunity, Larry, to serve on the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=461)|
| 0:07:45| It was very educational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| And the only sad thing is that everybody couldn't get everything they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| So there really needs to be more money allocated because they're all deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| And I hope that you'll honor the decisions that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| It's unfortunate that we ran out of money and some just didn't get anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| And if there's a way to fix that, it would be marvelous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=490)|
| 0:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=491)|
| 0:08:17| Commissioners, my name is Dan Smith or Daniel L. Smith, 7108 Lawford Road, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=497)|
| 0:08:27| And I had the privilege of serving on the Social Services Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| I want to be sure that you all understand, number one, the amount of work that Eric Hoagland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=514)|
| 0:08:45| and Judy Parker put into getting this package put together for these panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=525)|
| 0:08:54| It was no small task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| And also that, at least in my observation, it was about as objective as a project could be to the point of somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=537)|
| 0:09:15| sending an e-mail after we had our first meeting asking a question about something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=555)|
| 0:09:22| and then getting a response back from the county saying that we can only communicate through open meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| and do not respond to this e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| So the work that went into it, as you've already heard, lots of hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=575)|
| 0:09:42| and the scoring was based on realistic criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=582)|
| 0:09:51| And if the county, and this is kind of a twisted way of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| if the county is going to continue to use taxpayer money for funding non-profit projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=596)|
| 0:10:07| the county is always going to be faced with somebody didn't get any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| This was open and diverse and lots of people participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=615)|
| 0:10:22| And so it's better than the way it was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| But when you start talking about $4 million in taxpayer money, whether it should go to non-profits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| that's another consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| And I appreciate the time and I was really surprised that I got picked on the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=636)|
| 0:10:45| and I happened to mention it to one of the, I mean for the panel, and I mentioned it to one of the senior members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=645)|
| 0:10:54| of the administration that I really felt proud about being picked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=654)|
| 0:10:58| I never thought I'd get picked for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| And he says, well, we picked everybody who applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| And so in spite of that, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=664)|
| 0:11:10| Part of a select group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=670)|
| 0:11:13| Clerk, 8-11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=673)|
| 0:11:19| This is to receive the operational audit report of the Knox County Medical Examiner's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| from the independent auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| I'm still flipping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Page 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| It was 9-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| N-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| Properly moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| John Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=707)|
| 0:11:49| Is he gone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| Oh, that's his audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=713)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Mr. Jones is here to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=720)|
| 0:12:07| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| My name is Edwin Osborne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=728)|
| 0:12:09| I live in Marstown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=729)|
| 0:12:10| My office address is 1127 North Broadway here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=730)|
| 0:12:13| Mr. Jones is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=733)|
| 0:12:15| He and I worked together on this particular audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| And I've been asked to give you a briefing on some of the matters, more significant matters in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| You all have a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| And the first third of the audit just appoints you with the operational audit process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=745)|
| 0:12:34| so that you'll have some idea of what the expectations for the report were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| And there's a significant amount of the report that's I'll give you a moment to find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=758)|
| 0:12:55| After describing the operational audit process and what an operational audit is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| the next couple of pages of the report deal with the scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| We had a very specific scope in this particular audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| We do have some disclaimers, including the fact that it's not a financial audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| It's also not specifically an audit having to do with the specific controversy concerning the former medical examiner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=793)|
| 0:13:20| Dr. Elkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| But what we did do, probably the easiest way to explain what we did do is we evaluated it by sifting through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=802)|
| 0:13:32| The blades of the sifter would have been internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| The standards that we used were pretty much external to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=816)|
| 0:13:41| We used generic internal control standards as the filter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| And what shook out of it in just a few words is that the commission has some work to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=827)|
| 0:13:53| as well as the executive branch with respect to the medical examiner function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| One of the disclaimers is that we did not find anything that would cause us to believe that the end product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=838)|
| 0:14:04| the autopsies and the death investigations were not excellent in every technical respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=844)|
| 0:14:09| but that wasn't specifically what we were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| We were looking at operationally and administratively at this particular function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=852)|
| 0:14:18| And the findings, as I've mentioned before, point to the fact that there's a lot of work to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| Our best guess as to what happened was that the technical aspect of it worked so well that it had been pretty much ignored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| for at least 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| And we had three what we considered scope limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| One of the scope limitations was the fact that the parties, there are five different parties that go together under that umbrella| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=878)|
| 0:14:44| of the Regional Forensic Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| Those five parties were so closely aligned and there were so few contracts and documents between them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| they were operating essentially as one entity with a common purpose, which is good news and bad news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| It's a very efficient way to do things, but it's also not very effective when you look at it administratively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=900)|
| 0:15:06| So we disclaimed or considered a scope limitation the fact that the parties were so closely together that, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| the contract that we found that governs that operation predated even the center itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=914)|
| 0:15:19| So we determined it was pretty irrelevant, as were many of the other documents that we would expect to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=919)|
| 0:15:26| The other two disclaimers were, one, with respect to a scope limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=926)|
| 0:15:32| we did express an interest in talking to Dr. Elkins, a former medical examiner, and through her counsel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=932)|
| 0:15:40| we were advised she was not available for that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And a similar disclaimer in scope limitation for Cynthia Finch, to whom that unit once reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=944)|
| 0:15:56| The operational audit, essentially, we looked at what we considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| or actually what the Institute of Internal Auditors considered good operational practice or good internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=961)|
| 0:16:10| We looked at best practices for similar medical examiner functions, not only in this state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| with the four other regional forensic centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| We also went to Dr. Brissy's operation down at UAB in Birmingham, Alabama, and looked at their private act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=981)|
| 0:16:31| and they had some other things that were considered state of the art and compared that to what was happening here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=991)|
| 0:16:37| Our findings, very briefly, were in each case we listed the standard that we used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=997)|
| 0:16:43| a little background to give you some information about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| The general background that you need to understand is that, statutorily, the medical examiner has two functions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1006)|
| 0:16:53| one of which is death investigations, including autopsies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1013)|
| 0:16:57| and the other is record keeping for people who die in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| The findings are listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Basically, there was precious little documentation you would expect to find with respect to the operation of that unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1024)|
| 0:17:13| We did not even find that particular unit on the budget organizational chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| not to mention that the dollars weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1038)|
| 0:17:20| We believe the dollars were there, but the actual unit was not graphically represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| and that was typical of what we found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Pretty much this has been on automatic pilot, if I could summarize here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| It was on automatic pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1052)|
| 0:17:33| It just kept going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| The kinds of problems that have made this controversial were pretty much inevitable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| considering the fact that there was limited oversight on this end of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| Things technically at the morgue apparently worked well enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| but Knox County's interests at this point, we were not able to financially quantify what those interests were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1071)|
| 0:18:00| We believe those interests were served because the parties had agreed what the arrangements were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| But one of the expectations that some people who commissioned this audit wanted us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| was actually quantify the extent to which Knox County employees were used to perform autopsies out of county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1092)|
| 0:18:20| And what we found was that that was very difficult for us to quantify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| because we didn't have any backstopping agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| None of the parties had actually valued, for example, a pathology rotation through the morgue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| and Knox County's participation in it with its five full-time, six part-time, and the contract employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1117)|
| 0:18:45| For example, there were no contracts for the contract employees going back 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:50| That's an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| I'm not going to go through all the findings, but you kind of get the gist of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| The while we were figuring out what we were going to recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| there was a bill before the House and the Senate, HB 4200 and Senate Bill 4201,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1141)|
| 0:19:09| which were signed into law when you were having your budget, your joint budget meetings last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1149)|
| 0:19:16| That bill was being signed into law, and it radically changed how the medical examiner function works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1156)|
| 0:19:24| The other significant findings, we could not find evidence of either a working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| or a reliable contract compliance function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| That's not exactly specific to the medical examiner function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| but it will probably explain some of the other issues that you're dealing with that are controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1181)|
| 0:19:49| The best practices, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| you all have decisions to make relative to the new legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| Best practices, five out of five of the groups that we talked to were getting out of the medical examiner business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1198)|
| 0:20:05| By statute, including the new statute, you must have that function,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| but it does not necessarily have to be performed by someone directly supervised by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| Five out of five of the best practices that we saw statewide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1215)|
| 0:20:19| were municipalities getting out of the medical examiner business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| That is a process that you can actually outsource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Of course, there would be some issues with respect to the employees that would be affected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1229)|
| 0:20:33| and we didn't make a specific recommendation to avoid a conflict of interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1233)|
| 0:20:37| because half the fees were paid by each of the two sides of the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1237)|
| 0:20:42| That was also, by the way, the position that Dr. Elkins found herself in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1242)|
| 0:20:48| in that she was being paid by two different sources, four different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1248)|
| 0:20:53| one for death investigations by your body here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and also by a private group, University Pathologist PC, for the actual autopsies that she performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| So as you are working together and taking our recommendations of the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| we'd ask you to consider strongly perhaps getting out of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I understand from Mr. Troyer that those discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| which actually started prior to Ms. Finch's leaving, have now been picked up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1275)|
| 0:21:22| And Mr. Troyer and Dr. Van Meter are now, I think, resuming those particular discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| The final audit finding, we mentioned the standard of the internal auditing department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1290)|
| 0:21:37| and that was a matter that we defined as outside the scope of the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1297)|
| 0:21:43| which is kind of a double-sided coin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1303)|
| 0:21:46| one side being that we did not specifically mention the role of the internal audit in this medical examiner process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:52| The other side of that coin is that the absence of internal audit on the front end of this particular process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1312)|
| 0:22:03| called attention to some of the other major holes that we see in the organizational structure of your oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| By that I mean in documents dating back to 1977,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| it's pretty clear that the county commission has a very specific role in establishing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1336)|
| 0:22:23| and monitoring the contract compliance, monitoring internal controls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| And we found that that whole process needs a lot of work and would explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| and help you through a lot of the things that I understand that you're struggling with organizationally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| I think we have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1362)|
| 0:22:44| I guess this is for John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| John, Troyer, do you have a timetable as to when you're looking at these findings, implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| Could we get a report from you, say, in six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| Because obviously he's identified a lot of areas that are going to need some work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1374)|
| 0:22:58| I think he's got a lot of good ideas and I hope that it will be sooner than six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1378)|
| 0:23:04| So could we say six months or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| I don't think we need a resolution for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I'm just trying to get an understanding of maybe four months, three months, four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| I think within three months we'd like to have a proposal for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Yes, Mr. Osborne, what was the timeline, the time frame of this audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| How far back did you all take a look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Over the whole 13 years, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| I know it's not an official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| That's a very good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| The thing about an operational audit, of course, we put in there the first three or four pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| We did, if you want to think about it, it's wiki wheel looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| We looked at the whole organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1423)|
| 0:23:44| We keyed on the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| What we found was that, for example, when a contract was missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| and we didn't see one for three years and we went back and said, okay, do you have one for five years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:57| ten years ago, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| And Dr. Elkins, I think, was contracted originally in 1995| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:04| and we could not find evidence of a contract from 1995 forward to the time that she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| She was actually paid as a 1099 employee, but there were many references to a contract in the documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:17| But we never were able to find that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| And I guess this next question may be for Mr. Arms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| So now this office reports to you, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| Is that the way it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| It looks like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1469)|
| 0:24:30| Actually, the medical examiner is appointed by county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1470)|
| 0:24:34| and we sort of have review, maybe the better terminology is we review the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| It said it was moved from community service to your umbrella of reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1482)|
| 0:24:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| So in terms of this new law that's being passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| and it's kind of some recommendations on getting this accreditation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| have you all taken a look at that new law, what your plan is for coming in compliance with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| with the costs associated with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1503)|
| 0:25:05| Is that part of what Mr. Troy is going to present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| We know Mr. Van Meter has looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:10| And one of the things we talked about over a year ago is the need to basically certify our,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| what's the best term, Dr. Van Meter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| Accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| Is it obtaining accreditation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| So we've been looking at steps almost a year now on what it takes to obtain accreditation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| And, of course, at that time was when we had issues with Dr. Elkins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1529)|
| 0:25:33| and she was not present for an extended period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| So this is something we wanted to move toward for over a year now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| And we had realized that we didn't have several of these contracts in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| and had actually done some internal studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1545)|
| 0:25:47| and were looking at what basically a course of action that this audit recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1547)|
| 0:25:54| So we and Dr. Van Meter, I think, are in concurrence of what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| And I guess one of the points we've got to remember is Knox County doesn't own a morgue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| We don't have pathology labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1562)|
| 0:26:06| We don't own a hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1566)|
| 0:26:07| So what your medical examiner does has to be supported by other private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| and other institutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| We couldn't do this role on our own unless we wanted to get in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:19| unless we wanted to start our own morgue, which we never wanted to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| So the direction we're going is a direction we need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| So in terms of the mayor's budget, have we figured out, figured in some of these financials?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1587)|
| 0:26:33| So when we look at this budget presentation, that's going to be reflective of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1593)|
| 0:26:38| those enhancements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| I think that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| We have budget for staff positions, which if we outsource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| that would be the amount of money that we would outsource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1606)|
| 0:26:49| And, of course, the medical examiner, although we didn't have a contract in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| we were paying Dr. Elkins based on what amounts to an invoice we received for a negotiated salary from her| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1613)|
| 0:27:01| on an annual basis and we'll be doing the same thing moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| So we'll be continuing to pay the medical examiner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| And then the rest of the operation, we will look at outsourcing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| and we will pay an outsourcing fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| And that will end this issue of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| if someone performs an autopsy on a body that comes in from Black County, whether that's a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1639)|
| 0:27:26| something that the Knox County taxpayer needs to be made whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Even though that person could be a Knox County citizen who fell off of a bridge and spoke about National Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| if that body was brought in by Blount County, you know, that was a Blount County issue, not a Knox County issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1656)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| Yes, I just wanted to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| I see Dr. Van Meter is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| If you had anything you wanted to say, you don't have to get up if there's not anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| This was, I think, jointly funded by both the county and University of Tennessee pathologists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| And you concur pretty much with the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| Yes, I'm Stuart Van Meter, 8700 Darien Court, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1686)|
| 0:28:13| University pathologist welcomes the findings of the auditors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| I think this provides us a very nice framework, both University pathologists and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1698)|
| 0:28:24| for moving forward with an agreement that will benefit both parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| I think that we all recognize currently we've outgrown a model for practice that was developed over ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1709)|
| 0:28:41| And it's time to restructure to bring us into the 21st century.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1721)|
| 0:28:51| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1734)|

| 0:28:57| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| authorizing one or more loans under one or more loan agreements between Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1746)|
| 0:29:12| and a Tennessee public building authority in an aggregate principal amount of not to exceed $40 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| and execution and delivery of one or more loan agreements and other documents relating to said borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| providing for the application of the proceeds of said borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| and the payment of the county's obligations under the loan agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| consenting to the assignment of the county's obligations under the loan agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| approving one or more swap agreements in connection with the loan agreements authorized hereunder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| and taking all other necessary actions with respect to the foregoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| Voted for a 30-day deferral, 9-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1797)|
| 0:29:58| No, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Properly moved and seconded that we defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1805)|
| 0:30:06| Yeah, I was just thinking all the budgetary items today, 8-0-2, 8-0-3, 8-0-5, 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1806)|
| 0:30:20| We did 8-0-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| If we can do all those, well, that's already been deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| If we can defer 8-0-2 and 8-0-3 in 8-0-5, well, that's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| And 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Also 8-0-6, 8-0-7, 8-0-8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1833)|
| 0:30:34| 6-0-7, 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1834)|
| 0:30:36| That's already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1836)|
| 0:30:38| Those that were the two committees had different votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1838)|
| 0:30:45| if we can go ahead and just defer those until we take them up during the budgetary process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| I'll also do those now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| Commissioner Pinkston, you want to make that part of your motion to take 8-0-2 with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| And 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| 3 has already been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| The second okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| We have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| 6-0-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| Which one is 1-0-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1873)|
| 0:31:20| It was deferred 6-0-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| What about 8-0-4?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| I think we're on 8-13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| 8-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| Well, 8-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| This is approving a contract renewal with Rotiform Moss and Company PLLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1894)|
| 0:31:40| for the independent annual financial audit for fiscal year 2007-2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| There was no consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| No, I had that pulled off because the vote total in your packet is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| It says 9-0 to approve with an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| But if I recall right, I think it was only approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| You don't remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| That's the best of my knowledge I can remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| Finance approved with amendment 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Property moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| I make a substitute motion that we put this contract out for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| We've got a substitute motion that we put it out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| I've got a few things I'd like to discuss here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| If that would be all right, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| First off, Rothford Moss contributed money prior to the hospitality fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1959)|
| 0:32:50| contributed to the hospitality fund prior to receiving this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| and contributed again after receiving this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| And within the bid process, it has a, there's a statement here that says conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| Vendors must have a non-conflict of interest affidavit on file prior to the contract being awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1986)|
| 0:33:14| Now, I've also stated that I felt like this, them contributing money to this hospitality fund was a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=1994)|
| 0:33:23| And it violates our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| It violates even the, them to even bid on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2004)|
| 0:33:31| Then, if you go back to the contract itself, and I stated before, I asked them how come they haven't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2011)|
| 0:33:42| of all the things that we had just had a week ago, we just talked about the P cards, the travel audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2022)|
| 0:33:50| and some of the other problems that we found within the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2030)|
| 0:33:55| I asked them before, how come they never discovered that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| And their answer was that that wasn't within their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Well, paragraph 10 of the contract, any evidence of fraud, such as defalification, misappropriation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2041)|
| 0:34:10| malfeasance, embezzlement, or any other illegal acts shall be reported to the auditor in writing immediate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| or be reported by the auditor in writing immediately upon discovery to the comptroller of the treasury of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| state of Tennessee who shall under all circumstances have the authority and all the discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| or at the discretion of the comptroller to directly investigate such matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2070)|
| 0:34:35| And it goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| So why would this paragraph not be in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Why would this paragraph be in the contract if it was not part of their job?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2081)|
| 0:34:47| If you recall, is Richard Walls here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2087)|
| 0:34:52| He was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2092)|
| 0:34:53| Oh, he was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| If I recall right, he said that when he did his audit, he found 36 percent of all the P cards used in the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2094)|
| 0:35:04| office had some type of problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2104)|
| 0:35:08| And if he's finding that kind of rate of misdeeds, then how come this auditor didn't find anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:19| and report it to the comptroller's office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| Even last year when this was discussed and it was pointed out to them at that time by this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| how come they still didn't find any of those and report that to the comptroller at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| I think they're in violation of our charter and I think they're in violation of our contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| and that's why I'm putting it out, ask that we put this out for a rebid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I just had a question to ask the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| Under Section 202B of the charter, this is the one where it gives the commission the authority to take a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2153)|
| 0:36:02| to hire an independent audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| About halfway down through that paragraph, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| no individual auditor or member of an auditing firm so designated shall have any personal financial interest direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| or indirect in the physical affairs of the county or any of its offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| And it sort of gets back to what they mean by indirect financial interest if they were contributing to the hospitality fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2179)|
| 0:36:27| Would that be considered an indirect financial interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2187)|
| 0:36:33| I haven't looked at it for that purpose, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| I can if you wish that I do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| One thing that has occurred, we have certainly made this, we brought this to the attention of the comptroller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2200)|
| 0:36:50| The comptroller showed an interest in visiting with Roderick for Moss regarding the fund that they contributed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2210)|
| 0:37:01| and perhaps even regarding the audit or the lack of an audit of such fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| failure to find such fund even though they contributed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| I haven't talked with the comptroller this week to see if they, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| followed through with that line of questioning with Roderick for Moss or if they did anything about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| But I do know because I did it myself brought it to the attention of the state comptroller's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2245)|
| 0:37:33| I just have another comment on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| And, I mean, I think they're a good accounting firm and I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| I really don't know whether they should have picked up some of the irregularities or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2259)|
| 0:37:44| But I think just from the general public's perception is that an accounting firm that's doing business with the county government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| is also contributing to these types of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| And I'm quoting which a citizen said to me, and they really weren't trying to pass judgment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| but they were saying it just doesn't smell right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| And I think that's one of the concerns I have regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I think the comptroller had the same concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2287)|
| 0:38:11| But I don't know if they followed through with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2291)|
| 0:38:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Does anybody here from Roderick for Moss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Are they going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| Since they're not here, Craig, this may be to you or Mr. Roderick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| I knew that they had given money after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| So they gave money beforehand too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| How much did they give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| From my understanding it was before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2312)|
| 0:38:34| I don't know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| You also got to remember that, you know, there's a code of ethics that auditors and CPAs follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2316)|
| 0:38:42| And that would be it even states an appearance of a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2322)|
| 0:38:48| So even if this may not be a true conflict, in my opinion, it's at least an appearance of a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2328)|
| 0:38:58| I think it makes a statement that they're not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| I mean, obviously they knew it was on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| And it looks like they're not interested in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2342)|
| 0:39:04| They're not even here to defend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| Let me say this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| The agreement that Knox County has with Roderick for Moss, it's a tri-party agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2350)|
| 0:39:14| The state comptroller's office signs off on it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2354)|
| 0:39:17| I mean, it is virtually their agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| It's the state comptroller's boilerplate agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| If they find that there's a particular issue that is in question through the agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| I'm sure they would bring it to our attention and Roderick for Moss' attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| But they haven't done so yet to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2373)|
| 0:39:40| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| I don't like to disagree with my fifth district mate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| but I must disagree with one comment to leave the impression that they didn't find anything I think is a bit misleading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2387)|
| 0:39:54| Those of you who are new on commission, I don't know if you've received the Roderick for Moss report or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| but it's about that thick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| And they have invested, they looked at all of the constitutional offices as well as the mayor's office and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| and they did find several things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2406)|
| 0:40:08| There are several things we haven't even looked at yet that we really need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2408)|
| 0:40:12| And those are things that hopefully we can get to after we get through some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| But, for example, in the court clerk's office, they found that people were taking money home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2416)|
| 0:40:20| They found some irregularities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| And those things are being worked on and being taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| And, you know, we can go right down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| I mean, it's a very thick, lengthy document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| So to say that they didn't find anything, I think maybe not quote in the quote mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| and when you read their findings, they also found about the lack of receipts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| And they flagged that as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| And they also found documentation that was not being proper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| They flagged that as an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| So those are things that they did find in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2450)|
| 0:40:53| And so whether or not they get this contract or not is immaterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| but I did want to point out the fact that to leave the impression that they didn't find anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2457)|
| 0:41:02| I would take issue with that because there are several findings in that report that we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2462)|
| 0:41:07| as a body need to look at over the next few months because there are some things in there that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2467)|
| 0:41:13| when you look at it, we just need to make sure that those things are being taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| and that those things are being done properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| Just to, and I agree with you, Commissioner Hammond, we do need to go back and review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| I'm not saying that there weren't, and I probably misspoke, there were some good suggestions on their part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2486)|
| 0:41:32| And I'm not saying that they don't normally do a good audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| But I do think that them contributing to this hospitality fund, it, like Commissioner Briggs said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2496)|
| 0:41:46| it just doesn't smell right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I do believe it is being a conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| And I do think that we need to look for another auditing firm just so that the public has faith in this government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2512)|
| 0:42:03| and faith in the auditing firm that we do choose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2523)|
| 0:42:09| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2529)|
| 0:42:10| I'd like to see if the public could have faith in us and I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| We have a motion for the call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Now, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| Repeat the question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| This is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| Who voted on your call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Oh, just, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| Commissioner Moore still had his light on and I just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| Oh, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2561)|
| 0:42:42| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2562)|
| 0:42:43| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| That's what you all told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2564)|
| 0:42:48| So how many no's was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| Two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| One, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| We'll be back on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| The substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| Substitute motion, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| I'm going to put this contract out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:07| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| How many no's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| And me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| Mr. Chairman, I just want to see if I can say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| Are you a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2603)|
| 0:43:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Yes, I'm a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| One no, four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2612)|
| 0:43:33| Did you vote no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Kenzie, Ivan Norman, myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2614)|
| 0:43:41| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2621)|
| 0:43:42| So the motion passes 14 to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:47| Is this going to get put in the bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| We'll put it out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| I'd just like to make a comment, if you'd let me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| The reason why I voted no is because I don't know if Rutgers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| and Moss knew this was a part of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| If someone asked them to donate to have a breakfast for whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| or a lunch for, say, the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| and they wrote a check to Knox Hospitality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| I don't know how they would have known that it was part of Knox County government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| when it wasn't even showing on our books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2660)|
| 0:44:22| So they probably thought, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2662)|
| 0:44:24| it could have been some nonprofit or who knows what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| They came down and pleaded their case also and I can't remember everything that was said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| but I left with the impression that they didn't know, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2673)|
| 0:44:38| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2681)|
| 0:44:42| Mr. Chair, I'll let Mr. Troy go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| I just want to say that I spoke with the Rotifer Moss people last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| and the reason they're not here is it was on consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| and so it was their understanding that on consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| there was an expectation that it would be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| I think they would like to come, I guess, make their case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| or at least maybe give them the opportunity to make their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| They have already done some work on this year and would be do some payment for the work already started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2706)|
| 0:45:15| Commissioner Henry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| I mean, that's well, and this might be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| What ballpark figure impact on this piece of the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:27| I mean, this is going to be significant in terms of bringing in a new accountant at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2727)|
| 0:45:31| and I guess paying Rotifer Moss for what all the services they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I guess you just can't cut the contract off at five o'clock today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2735)|
| 0:45:40| Well, you can, but there will be a cost associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Yeah, there will be a cost associated because they've already done some preliminary planning on this year's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| And four years ago, we put this out for bid, and they were the low bid, and we locked them into a price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| And in today's environment, I'm sure that it would be more expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2754)|
| 0:45:59| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2759)|
| 0:46:01| What was the cost of this year's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Would you happen to have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2763)|
| 0:46:04| In the neighborhood of $110,000 to $120,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| So are you, could it be a factor of two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| I think it was almost a factor of two for the next lowest bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2773)|
| 0:46:25| Commissioner McKenzie, we approved these contracts one year at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2785)|
| 0:46:30| And it's been stated again and again, misstated, that we gave them a four-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2790)|
| 0:46:37| We didn't give them a four-year contract because our charter doesn't allow us to give a four-year contract for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| We can only do one year at a time, and we have to approve it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2802)|
| 0:46:49| And just because we had an option to pick it up, I don't know that we should, we owe them anything for next year's work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2809)|
| 0:46:58| because we haven't approved their contract for next year's work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| But at the same point, we have a price for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| I understand that there may, there probably will be an additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| It's unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2833)|
| 0:47:15| But I also think it was unfortunate that we had an auditor that appeared, at least appeared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| to have a conflict of interest when they contributed both before and during the having this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2843)|
| 0:47:31| I definitely understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| But I, like Commissioner Strickland, I was not a member of this commission at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2853)|
| 0:47:36| But they have, for whether you believe it or not, and I guess you didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2856)|
| 0:47:42| they explained they're giving to that fund and whether they knew it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| And, you know, again, I was not part of the commission at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| But in this time of lien that we're in right now, to go out and spend another hundred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| $200,000 because there might have been an appearance or there might not have been an appearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2878)|
| 0:48:07| Well, in my opinion, there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| And I guess in the rest of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| But it's kind of like we're saying that $100,000 going to these non-profits would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2893)|
| 0:48:24| But to have it go for an audit that may end up adding no additional value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2904)|
| 0:48:31| probably will add no additional value by just choosing another firm, I don't know if that's responsible on our part or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2911)|
| 0:48:38| Well, I guess it depends on the value of the confidence you have in the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| And that may, I guess that's an intangible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| I would just add that, you know, the first time you make a contribution and you're not the auditor, it's excusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| You may not know the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| When you are the auditor and that money is coming in from you to some entity you're auditing, you should know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2936)|
| 0:49:05| So either they had a tenure to the ethical matter or they weren't a good auditor on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2945)|
| 0:49:11| So that's why I voted to put it up for bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| Mr. Chairman, this has been voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:22| That was exactly what I turned my light on for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| I'm not real familiar with Robert's rules of order, but is it appropriate to continue to debate after a vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2966)|
| 0:49:33| We can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Let's go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2974)|
| 0:49:35| Move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2975)|
| 0:49:36| The motion is already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2976)|
| 0:49:45| Resolution 813 is authorizing the Knox County Law Director to file motion for partial relief from injunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2985)|
| 0:49:52| in McElroy v. Knox County Commission to allow electronic communication via IRC in accordance with the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=2992)|

| 0:50:03| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| I make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3005)|

| 0:50:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3010)|

| 0:50:17| Mark Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3017)|
| 0:50:19| It passes 18 to 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3019)|

| 0:50:41| It was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3041)|

| 0:51:16| We need to please talk into the microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:21| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Mr. Todd, I appreciate the information you sent me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| And this, I don't guess this has anything to do with probably your office, but the number of injured people that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3089)|
| 0:51:39| is like 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| I think it was, yeah, 61, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3102)|
| 0:51:46| Now, I know that comes from the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3108)|
| 0:51:50| Is it seems to me that there's, you know, companies out here that do what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3110)|
| 0:51:58| Can a court put down an incident status on these folks to the probation department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3118)|
| 0:52:08| when it's kind of in lieu of going to jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| I mean, I think anybody in Knox County would pay $35 not to have to go to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| When a court rules, it's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| I'm not a lawyer, but the law director could probably speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| When a court rules, as far as a probation order is concerned, and they rule that the person's indigent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| I can be held in contempt and be placed in jail for ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| I really don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3152)|
| 0:52:33| Well, I think moving forward, we need to try to make as much money as we can off these individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3153)|
| 0:52:40| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| And because the numbers you showed, like 2,520 probationers, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3161)|
| 0:52:49| a thousand of them were violated for probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| So is that a number that's outstanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Are these folks incarcerated at the present time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| Those numbers would be outstanding VOPs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| They're still on our caseload, and they have not been arrested yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| And then you had like another 800 or 900 indigent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:06| And then the people who are paying are like 600 out of 2,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| Whatever that report says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Mr. Law Director, is an order, I mean, I'm just saying how does a private company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3193)|
| 0:53:22| depending on the private probation council or private probation services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| so does a judge order them because they say their numbers are like 4% indigent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| I don't know what the judge orders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3213)|
| 0:53:35| but if they order that someone or somebody or some corporation has indigent status,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| then I know that we can't charge any type of fee for that person or thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3221)|
| 0:53:49| And we're bound by that court's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| And the courts examine them on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| I mean, they have to fill out a petition for relief from the costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3233)|
| 0:54:00| They have to fill out an affidavit of indigency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| At least they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Okay, because, I mean, they end up having to pay their parking tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| They end up paying their speeding tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| And if I thought I was going to go to jail or I could pay $45 or $35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| I believe I'd pay the $35 or $45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| I mean, it's, you know, it should be the people who use the probation office responsibility to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:30| I totally agree with you, Commissioner, unless the judge allows them not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3270)|
| 0:54:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3275)|
| 0:54:36| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3276)|

| 0:55:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3317)|
| 0:55:18| My name is Greg McKay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| I'm the administrator of elections, room 214 in the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| I think what this body wanted to know what this was for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| This is to pay the legal fees associated with Jordan et al.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| And also all the other bevy of lawsuits that we faced in the last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| We, of course, didn't have any idea this was going to happen, so we couldn't budget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| It's just something we have to pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| Commissioner Davis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| Mr. McKay, do you not use the law department for legal services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| Do you have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| I think in this case the law director couldn't represent everybody, if you remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| Right, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| At times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3367)|
| 0:56:08| There was a conflict then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| Is that the reason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| Yes, he told us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3370)|
| 0:56:11| There's a state statute that provides it when you're dealing with an issue such as this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| The county, if it were a city issue, the city would be paying the tab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| But it was a county issue, and the county is liable for these expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3381)|
| 0:56:27| And that's per statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| Why are we paying them now and two years later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3390)|
| 0:56:32| Well, I don't know if it's two years later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3392)|
| 0:56:34| I think the hope was that as the budget year progressed, we may not need to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3404)|

| 0:57:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| I think there was some confusion on this part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| The bill is due in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3439)|
| 0:57:21| I had originally planned on putting this is only the second time we've paid this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| So I had originally planned on putting it into next year's budget and just paying it, you know, July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| But when we met with the finance people, they suggested that it would be better to do it this way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| to go ahead and pay it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| Are there any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3458)|
| 0:57:41| Seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3461)|
| 0:57:42| Can I ask one question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| So do you have budgeted then next May when you have to pay this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3463)|
| 0:57:47| Do you have it in your budget this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3467)|

| 0:58:37| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3517)|
| 0:58:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3519)|
| 0:58:40| Who's second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3520)|
| 0:58:43| Who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:44| Daniel's in the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| I heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3528)|
| 0:58:52| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| Much as I appreciate the desire to use local advertising resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3536)|
| 0:59:01| Comcast Spotlight and others simply do not draw the appropriate audience with the appropriate resources to put bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3541)|
| 0:59:10| It's not a demographically sensible media buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| So, you know, maybe magazines developed related to developers, maybe websites related to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| But no matter how much Comcast Spotlight can target by neighborhood or by head end or by other resource,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3561)|
| 0:59:27| it doesn't seem like a demographically targeted good sense advertising buy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| Commissioner Harmon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| As I recall, someone was going to check with Mr. Furrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| I believe he was going to be handling the auction to see how he was going to advertise this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| Am I missing something on that or was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3582)|
| 0:59:54| Matt Myers, Knox County Purchasing, 1000 North Central Street, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3594)|
| 1:00:00| Commissioner Hammond, I believe, Hugh Holt did talk with Mr. Furrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| He was not overly impressed with the idea, much like some of the other concerns that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| You're not reaching a targeted audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| Particular property is, you know, developers, a tight-knit community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| They know what's going on in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| He didn't advise one way or the other, but he wasn't overly impressed with spending the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| But he is going to be advertising it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3630)|
| 1:00:31| I mean, he has people that he's going to be sending it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3631)|
| 1:00:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3632)|
| 1:00:33| It's to his advantage to get a number of people in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:36| And what price tag are we looking at on this to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3636)|
| 1:00:39| As I recall, it was about $4,000 plus production costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3639)|
| 1:00:42| It was going to be about $175, about $4,500 approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| Is that what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| Hugh Holt had suggested $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| It was only going to be $150 to create a 30-second commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| But they could have tweaked that and made that $500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3657)|
| 1:01:00| They could have made it $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| But Hugh had indicated that he wanted a $2,000 campaign initially before Mayor Mike Ragsdale said no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3662)|
| 1:01:16| So, basically, Sam Furrow is going to be sending out materials and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| And is that included?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| He's going to be paid a fee, I'm sure, for auctioning this off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| And that's part of his fee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3686)|
| 1:01:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| They advertise as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| We advertise also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| Now, how will you be advertising?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| We advertise in the local papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3692)|
| 1:01:35| The property has been on the bid process several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| We advertise in the Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3700)|
| 1:01:43| I think the last time we actually went and did the Hall Shopper, the South Knoxville paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and those community papers, we've advertised in all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3708)|
| 1:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3711)|
| 1:01:54| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| I just wanted to let you know that I had spoken with Hugh Holt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| And he showed me where they advertised in the Knoxville News Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| And they paid $500 for that ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3727)|
| 1:02:10| And it was in the real estate section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3730)|
| 1:02:13| I also wanted you to know that I had a difficult time finding the listing on Sam Furrow's site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| And I went to the law director for another item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3739)|
| 1:02:21| And I just mentioned it to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3741)|
| 1:02:24| He also had a difficult time finding it initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| And then he landed on another site and found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3746)|
| 1:02:29| And so, even on his own website, it didn't seem that it was flagged very well, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3749)|
| 1:02:37| And I do think that it seems in Knox County, especially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3757)|
| 1:02:40| that the developers do have a pretty tight-knit camaraderie because it's hard for a lot of the outsiders to get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3760)|
| 1:02:47| And I think it's fascinating that people are proposing to continue to advertise in the Knoxville News Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3767)|
| 1:02:54| when, in my opinion, that seems light years away from other forms of advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| And the campaign that was suggested by Hugh Holt was a $2,000 campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| Hugh could have advertised and reached 140,000 families in the Knox County and Blount County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3784)|
| 1:03:09| Sevier County area and have actually even done it on a smaller scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| And I find it very interesting that on Monday, when I had requested for Mayor Mike Ragsdale's resignation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3795)|
| 1:03:23| that same day is the day that he said no to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3803)|
| 1:03:26| So there's a lot of things that I find very fascinating about the turn of events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| And I just don't think that we need to give this away to one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| And I just wanted to share that and make a motion that we continue with even maybe a smaller campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3815)|
| 1:03:44| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| Victoria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3829)|
| 1:03:50| I agree that we need to do something to help market this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I just agree with Mr. Harmon also that I don't believe that cable television is the best place to advertise a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3834)|
| 1:04:02| property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| How would you feel about maybe a friendly amendment to allocate, say, $500 for magazine advertising| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3845)|
| 1:04:14| for magazines that are distributed nationwide to developers to see if we might could draw some folks in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3854)|
| 1:04:22| I believe it's too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| June 5th is the auction date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| Too late for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3865)|
| 1:04:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| Well, I really appreciate your creativity in bringing this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| And I do think that we need to try something different when we sell things in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3871)|
| 1:04:37| But I will be voting against this because I just don't think that this property on that media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3877)|
| 1:04:44| But I hope that you'll continue to bring ideas like this forward because I think you're thinking in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3884)|
| 1:04:52| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| I would, to a degree, like to echo what Commissioner Lambert just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| And I really appreciate the effort that Commissioner DeFries has put into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| And it shows a sincere effort to try to get the county the best price for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| But it's almost the principle that we're trying to micromanage how to sell a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| I have no background in marketing at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3916)|
| 1:05:19| The motivation for the Furl Auction Company is that I'm sure they're working on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3919)|
| 1:05:25| And the more they get, you know, the more they get for the building, the more they're going to get in commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| They are the experts in marketing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| They know who to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| And I don't think they'll limit it to some group here in Knoxville if they think they can get more money from somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3934)|
| 1:05:40| But just as a point of principle, I'm going to vote against it because I think we're trying to micromanage this too much rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| than say we want to sell it and then leave it to the experts on the best way to get that word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| But I do appreciate your effort very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Yes, if I understood correctly, I believe Mr. Freese said this reached 140,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| Yes, it was a little bit above 130,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| I believe that's more than the circulation of the new Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| I may be wrong on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| And Rebecca's here if she'd like to answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3971)|
| 1:06:13| But I believe that's more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3973)|
| 1:06:15| We need to get this out to as many people as possible, I think, to try to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| And no more than it's going to cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3981)|
| 1:06:23| And it may cost us more than the building brings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| Paul, it has to be, excuse me for interrupting, 140,000 has to be, you know, the people who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3987)|
| 1:06:32| it has to be in a form and of a type of people who are capable of making a bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| Well, it was the same way with the 70 or 80,000 that the Sentinel had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| Absolutely, but there's a difference there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| And the Sentinel's in a fixed form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4002)|
| 1:06:45| Not like a TV ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4005)|
| 1:06:46| So a fixed format like that can be sent along as an e-mail attachment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4006)|
| 1:06:50| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| Pardon me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4011)|
| 1:06:52| I have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4012)|
| 1:06:53| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Probably second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4015)|
| 1:06:56| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| Call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4018)|
| 1:07:01| We have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4028)|

| 1:09:40| Park Satellite Office at the Knoxville Center Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4180)|
| 1:09:43| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4183)|
| 1:09:47| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4191)|
| 1:09:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| Moved and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to recuse myself since I work for the Knox County Trustee's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4201)|
| 1:10:02| And they're probably part of the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4202)|
| 1:10:05| Do we know what is the total price?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| That's why I want to know how much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to ask the clerk to come down and clarify this issue for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4210)|
| 1:10:22| George Stokesberry, Knox County Clerk, 300 Main Street, Knoxville 37901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4222)|
| 1:10:29| This here is only a change of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| It's an amendment between the clerk's office and Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4231)|
| 1:10:36| A change of hours from 10 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| We'll run one shift there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| That means from 8 to 10 and 7 to 9 at night closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| And Saturday we'll be open from 10 to 4 as usual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4249)|
| 1:10:54| This, what this is, is it won't be any less service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| It would mean that we can run one shift at Knoxville Center, which over the period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| we have heard that we have too many employees at Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4266)|
| 1:11:11| What it will do will allow us to move some people around, which we need to move around at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| Here we are down to 111 employees in our office, which we had 128 at one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| So we really need to move some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| Summer is coming around, vacations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| We need to put some people, some locations, and this will allow us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:40| I've discussed this with the trustee already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| and the trustee is in agreement with this change of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4304)|
| 1:11:49| Discussed it with them all already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| They're in agreement with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| It's a matter of sending it back to Simon Properties in Indianapolis for final approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4314)|
| 1:12:04| Commissioner Roundtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| George, is this going to significantly impact the level of service you all have been providing out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:11| from 8 to 10 in the morning and 7 and 9 at night?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| We've been looking at that, and we do very little service at those hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4335)|
| 1:12:22| And what it will do is allow us during our end of month to be fully staffed during those hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| that you've been out there that there's long lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4349)|
| 1:12:33| and it will allow us to have all of our desks full out there during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| If they come in at 10 o'clock, probably wouldn't take a lunch break until sometime in the afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4357)|
| 1:12:43| What is your busiest day of the month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:46| Busiest days are probably the last three to four days of the month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| and then, of course, the first two or three of the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| That's tradition throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4375)|
| 1:13:00| So, George, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4380)|
| 1:13:01| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| I was just going to ask basically the same question as to what was your traffic from 8 to 10 to 7 to 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| I wouldn't see that you would have that many folks out there that you would be servicing from those hours, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| Commissioner McKinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| Because the mall doesn't open until 10, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| The mall doesn't open until 10, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4400)|
| 1:13:21| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4401)|
| 1:13:22| Commissioner McKinley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| So, is this going to allow for full service at the five-point location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| Because I went out there trying to conduct some business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4409)|
| 1:13:31| and there's a lot of things that typical clerk's office do that doesn't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4411)|
| 1:13:36| What it would do is allow during that 8 to 10 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| probably get more people to come over to the five-points office there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4420)|
| 1:13:46| If we are not open at Knoxville Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| it would certainly allow anyone that needed service in that east Knoxville area to come over to five-points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4428)|
| 1:13:58| George, are all your offices full service?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4438)|
| 1:14:02| Not all of our offices are full service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| No, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| We don't have driver's license at all of our stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| We don't have passports at all of our stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| We only offer select things, but Knoxville Center is a full service operation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4450)|
| 1:14:18| I guess to kind of piggyback on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| could I get a list of what the centers, and it may be out there on the web,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| but could you provide me with a list of what centers provide?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4464)|
| 1:14:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| George, the same number of hours of operation, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| Same number of hours of operation that you have now or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4476)|
| 1:14:43| No, we'll be reducing our hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4483)|
| 1:14:45| Same money, reducing hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| Well, what it will do, we are down to 111 employees right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| which I probably need to hire two or three employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| What it will do is allow me to take some of the employees that are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| and move them to other locations rather than hiring an additional employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| No one there will lose their job at Knoxville Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:13| It will just mean that we will shift some to some other stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4519)|
| 1:15:20| If we're reducing hours and we're not saving any money, why do we need this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:28| Well, I think if we actually looked at it, Mr. Olin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:32| that over the period of months that there would be a savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| if you're counting four hours a day there for each employee not working at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| But what the savings that I see for our office will be that we don't have to hire additional employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4543)|
| 1:15:56| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| All in favor of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4559)|
| 1:16:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:02| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4562)|
| 1:16:04| And if you'll get down my recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| Eighteen, zero, and one excused himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4568)|
| 1:16:15| 9-19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| Resolution 9-19 is amending the Knox County Commission rules to allow for the Finance Committee meeting to begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| at 8.30 a.m. and the Intergovernmental Committee meeting to begin at 10, both on the Monday prior to the Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| Mr. Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4593)|
| 1:16:35| I take a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| We have a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| I don't have a problem with finance having Mondays at 8.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:53| Let's go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Just to throw it out there, because what happens is an hour and a half is a short amount of time to go through everything we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| having on our agendas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| And I think instead of trying to have one committee rush through the items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4628)|
| 1:17:16| then it would be my suggestion that if finance wants Mondays at 8.30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| I think Intergovernmental should just meet on another day, whether it be Tuesday or Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4643)|
| 1:17:29| so that both committees can operate and fully discuss the items that are before them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4649)|
| 1:17:38| So if, you know, that would be my suggestion is to allow finance to have their meeting and start it when they wish to start it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4658)|
| 1:17:48| and we'll start ours on Intergovernmental on a different day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| Before we went down to two committees, we used to have, I don't know, about four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| Do you remember that, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| And they met on various days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4679)|
| 1:18:01| Well, why don't you say we could do it on Tuesday at 8.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4681)|
| 1:18:04| You want to do it on Tuesday at 8.30?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4686)|
| 1:18:07| Is that a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4687)|
| 1:18:08| I'd like to second it if it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4688)|
| 1:18:09| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| We need to probably take this to the rules committee anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4691)|
| 1:18:16| Well, if we want to take this to the rules committee, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| However best to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| I just think both committees need to have, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| the time that each of them need to discuss the items that are before them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4706)|
| 1:18:33| without feeling like they need to rush through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| because every commissioner on this body needs to be able to deliberate in a public meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| which is that's one of our few times to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| So I think it's prudent that each committee have their time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| Since this is going to have to go before the rules committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| I think it's an appropriate time to have input to let them know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| Does the law director just need to go before the rules committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4742)|
| 1:19:05| We're making the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Yeah, I've asked him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| Unless you wish to suspend your rules, which takes two-thirds majority of those here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4747)|
| 1:19:13| Section R of your rules says rules may be amended upon the report of the rules committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4753)|
| 1:19:18| after seven days notice of the proposed change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4758)|
| 1:19:25| So we haven't had our seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| Well, it would take a two-thirds vote to suspend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Do we have a motion to suspend the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| In the event that we want to vote for it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| We have a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| A second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| It takes a two-thirds vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4782)|
| 1:19:43| Thirteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Do you have something else, Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| So is the motion to suspend the rules to consider the original motion or with a Monday-Tuesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4789)|
| 1:19:54| Well, then we could get back to discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| I'll suspend the rules right now to have, I guess, talk on Greg's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Does everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4804)|
| 1:20:05| Do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4805)|
| 1:20:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| You know, it is 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| And this is a record time for these people who have been on commission since February 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| Do you not think that perhaps it was because we met together and vetted at length together?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| And so I just wanted you all to think about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| We have a motion to suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| Both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4829)|
| 1:20:32| Do we have a no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4832)|
| 1:20:36| One no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4836)|
| 1:20:37| It passes 18-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| Mr. Chairman, some of these new commissioners, they're welcome to come in and sit at the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4840)|
| 1:20:48| I think they said they'd like to hear what both committees say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4848)|
| 1:20:51| That's two meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| If you'll let me finish, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4853)|
| 1:20:55| They're welcome to come in, but they would be a non-speaking and non-voting member of the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| No, I would have to disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4861)|
| 1:21:03| All commissioners will have a chance to speak, Mr. Peekson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4863)|
| 1:21:06| They won't have a chance to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| They can speak on their committee, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| Well, no, that's against our rules as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| They can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| They can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4873)|
| 1:21:14| They cannot vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| They don't get to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| Now, it's also part of our rules that if their seatmate is not there, then they are to be seated on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4877)|
| 1:21:26| So if for some reason, Commissioner Pinkston, you could not attend, say, the finance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| which I know that your attendance is at least 100 percent, then commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| He couldn't call me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Well, if you were to show up and he wasn't there, then you could sit in and be a voting member of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| And but I don't think we need to not allow commissioners to speak at either one of the committees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| but they would not have a vote on that committee unless their seatmate is not there to represent that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4911)|
| 1:21:57| Can you limit their time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4917)|
| 1:21:59| Well, that would be up to the commissioner, the chairman of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| I can go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Do you have a motion, Commissioner Lutell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Yeah, I'd like to make a motion that we have Commissioner Pinkston, are you going to have Mondays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| Would Tuesdays be good with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| We want Mondays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4936)|
| 1:22:17| I think he wants Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4937)|
| 1:22:19| You want Mondays?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Then finance will meet at 8.30 on Mondays and intergovernmental will meet at 8.30 on Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4941)|
| 1:22:27| Can I get a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4947)|
| 1:22:28| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| Properly moved and seconded that we move intergovernmental to Tuesday at 8.30 and finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4950)|
| 1:22:35| And I guess that's to start with the June meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| June meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| Commissioner Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| I'm going to make the substitute motion that we continue to meet together, I think, as Mr. Freese has pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| That is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Oh, that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4973)|
| 1:22:55| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| Well, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| I guess Paul made a motion to approve what was before us and I made a substitute just to change when intergovernmental would meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4981)|
| 1:23:09| Now, I've not had a chance to talk to the folks on intergovernmental and they haven't had this before them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| so I don't know if that's a --I'd like to hear back from those members on intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4994)|
| 1:23:19| Well, I see no likes on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=4999)|
| 1:23:21| Well, they must like it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5001)|

| 1:27:20| First, we have Brad Mays, public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5240)|
| 1:27:30| I was surprised to get called so early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5252)|
| 1:27:33| My name is Brad Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5253)|
| 1:27:34| I live at 1817 Plum Branch Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37932.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| I came here because there's some certain things that you've been misled about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| I was going to go over these real quick with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| The first one was the commission prior to February this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5266)|
| 1:27:49| Some of you I've made aware was informed that Len Mays was in the mulch business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| His complaints were lies because they were trying to shut down the competition to his family's business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5273)|
| 1:27:59| That turned out not to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| You all were told their performance bond was released.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| That turned out not to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| You all were told I had a financial interest in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| I have no financial interest in this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| That turned out to be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| Most recently, I was informed that you all were told that fecal coliform counts don't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| as long as they pass the Salmonella test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5299)|
| 1:28:22| This is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| That is a federally mandated minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| The state of Tennessee has Rule 1200 that regulates this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| And the state of Tennessee says only fecal coliform counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| And if it's over 1,000, you cannot sell it to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| And that is not --basically, it's a health and safety regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| There is nowhere anywhere in our state law and regulations where they mention Salmonella,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| only fecal coliform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| And I think you all have been misled with this EPA regulations when they know they have to meet these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5328)|
| 1:28:53| state regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| They conveniently didn't send me a copy of that letter that you all received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| Fifth, they told you they passed these Salmonella tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| Well, I got to looking at these Salmonella tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| The Salmonella tests are supposed to be reported in four gram units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5345)|
| 1:29:09| If they have anything over three colonies per every four gram, that's considered high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5349)|
| 1:29:15| The test was less than five colonies per each individual gram.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5355)|
| 1:29:20| I've checked on my test with my lab.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| They failed every fecal coliform but one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| They failed all the Salmonella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| They didn't pass a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| I turned around and sent the EPA a copy of Knox County's test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| And he said they didn't pass any of these Salmonellas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| But you were told they passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| But he did tell me that to conclusively know, it's best to have this expressed in per four gram units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5381)|
| 1:29:48| And there's a specific way to run these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| I had those ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5390)|
| 1:29:51| I had a preliminary and a final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| These tests were taken, taking a sterilized sandwich bag, reaching through it inadvertently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| picking up the mulch, putting it in another sterilized bag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5398)|
| 1:30:01| We called ahead of time and had the material ready for the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5401)|
| 1:30:04| We scheduled everything, saved the receipt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| Your Salmonella was off the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Your fecal coliform was off the chart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| We sent the results back this morning and they've been selling this all last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| So that's another thing you've been misled on about these Salmonella test passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| They were conveniently reported in individual units rather than four gram units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5420)|
| 1:30:25| which cut the resulting number back to one-fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| And I hope this was just a simple mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5429)|
| 1:30:35| Product safety certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Mr. Salter has signed product safety certifications for 03, 04, and 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| EPA Rule 503.32A7 requires testing for these product safety certifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| There are required four quarterly tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| I have requested these from Mr. Salter at least three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5452)|
| 1:30:55| He has never provided them for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| Mr. Moore has requested them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| I don't think he ever got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| There's at least 10 or 12 of these quarterly tests missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5461)|
| 1:31:05| I finally found some of the quarterly testing from 05.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5465)|
| 1:31:09| It failed Salmonella with a count of 1,600, and it's never supposed to be over three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5469)|
| 1:31:14| It failed fecal coliform with alarmingly high levels as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| Yet we have product safety certifications signed for that year by someone who didn't work for Knox County that year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| and most recently under oath admitted that he never even looked at the quarterly lab reports before he signed these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5485)|
| 1:31:31| documents, which is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| Seventh thing that I feel you all have been misled on, we didn't get the green waste that we were promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5495)|
| 1:31:42| The contract says we're supposed to get 15,000 tons a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| Well, the RFP said we've been averaging about 15,000 tons a year, and we think the volume has the potential to double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5505)|
| 1:31:55| Well, they had conveniently left the pallets off of their reported inbound tons of green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| Prior to the filing of this lawsuit, they always included pallets in green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| On their website, it says pallets are green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5527)|
| 1:32:09| On Knox County's website, it says pallets are green waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| Yet when I filed this lawsuit, all the new numbers conveniently left pallets out of the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| They said that the volumes were supposed to double.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5539)|
| 1:32:22| The contract says the potential exists to double the volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5542)|
| 1:32:26| And it's the contractor's responsibility to go out and find these volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| And some of those volumes can come from biosolids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| And they got these biosolids, and their inbound tonnage jumped to 30,000 tons a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| which happens to be twice 15,000 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| You asked how much money you were paid in the life of this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5562)|
| 1:32:47| They didn't tell you about all the utility company money, millions of dollars in sewer sludge disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5567)|
| 1:32:54| While they're crying, poor me, we didn't get our money, they didn't tell you they were getting paid $50 a ton in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5574)|
| 1:32:59| sewer sludge disposal, and they received millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| You were told they didn't get their Forks of the River permit in a timely basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5584)|
| 1:33:09| You were told they didn't get this because a sinkhole happened at Solway and it used up all the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5589)|
| 1:33:15| They were supposed to get this permit by the end of 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5595)|
| 1:33:18| That sinkhole didn't happen until long after 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5598)|
| 1:33:21| Mr. May, if you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| You were told they didn't get the permit at Solway or the Forks of the River because odor complaints from Solway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5602)|
| 1:33:29| We didn't get any odor complaints in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5609)|
| 1:33:31| Only one thing happened in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| The area that was designated that we were going to use for composting at the Forks of the River facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| a couple of months after they signed the composting permit contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| they signed a subsequent contract agreeing to use that particular area of the property for recycled tires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5622)|
| 1:33:50| And they were paid approximately $50,000 a year to run Knox County's used tire program off the section of the Forks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5630)|
| 1:33:56| property where it was originally planned for the composting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| That is the only thing that happened in 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| None of these other things, they happened long after the Forks permit was way overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5645)|
| 1:34:12| But how could you operate the tire recycling program to run 500,000 tires a year through the same couple of acres you were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5652)|
| 1:34:21| supposed to do the composting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| They signed that contract just a month or two after they signed the composting contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| We have yet to see a single solitary letter where they ever complained about that Forks permit before I filed this lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5667)|
| 1:34:35| Thank you, Mr. May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| Is there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| I just have one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:39| Normally on the testing for the coliform bacteria that's done on a regular basis to determine whether the product is safe or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5679)|
| 1:34:46| who does that testing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Is it a test that they do themselves and they send off?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| Or who does the test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5690)|
| 1:34:51| They usually self-test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5691)|
| 1:34:53| They take it to micro-back laboratories in Maryville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| Maryville reports the results back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| Now, that's supposed to be done on a quarterly basis on the finished products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| Most of those quarterly lab reports are now missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| I found some of it, and the ones I've found have been bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5705)|
| 1:35:09| So it's either state or state and federal both, one of the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| Is there anyone here from solid waste?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| Is Mr. Salter here or from engineering?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5716)|
| 1:35:20| You know, I really just have one question that I think we look into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| I mean, and I don't want to beat this subject to death.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| I have one question that I'd like to ask the solid waste people if we could get in touch with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| and that is this product safe for the public to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5729)|
| 1:35:32| I'm not asking you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5732)|
| 1:35:33| I want to ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5733)|
| 1:35:35| I know this contract ends in the contract ends, I think, at the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| But that's my only question to the people at solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5740)|
| 1:35:46| Well, the EPA man I spoke to before I came to this meeting today said it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5746)|
| 1:35:51| He said the salmonella counts were way too high and the fecal coliform counts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| I had it tested last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5754)|
| 1:35:55| I got the results back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| I guess the question is if EPA feels that way or if the state feels that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| are they not in contact with our, you know, with our local government?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5760)|
| 1:36:04| Or do they, is this just?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| I'm going to be in contact with them in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5766)|
| 1:36:09| Well, I know you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5769)|
| 1:36:10| I mean, this has been going on a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5770)|
| 1:36:11| But if it's really unsafe, why hasn't the EPA come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| Why hasn't the state come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5774)|
| 1:36:15| Why aren't they communicating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5775)|
| 1:36:17| I mean, my concern is just public safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| And it's, you know, and it's really the opinion of the people from the EPA, from the state, and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5780)|
| 1:36:28| And I know you've done the testing and you've done a lot of work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5788)|
| 1:36:32| So has the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| But I just want to know, I just want to know, is the product safe for our citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| The last thing I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| I think there's a fellow there behind you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5799)|
| 1:36:42| I'm Jim Snow with Norris County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5802)|
| 1:36:45| Tom Salter had to leave, but we really can't speak on this matter due to a mediation that's pending right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5805)|
| 1:36:53| Well, I mean, just a second, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5813)|
| 1:36:54| I mean, if it's a public safety issue, why can't you speak on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5814)|
| 1:36:59| I'm not talking about the finance part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| I'm just talking about a pure public safety question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5821)|
| 1:37:03| Is our public being harmed by it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5823)|
| 1:37:06| Because if there really is the potential for them being harmed, then we need to stop selling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5826)|
| 1:37:14| Commissioner Briggs, I spoke with Mr. Salter by phone just a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5834)|
| 1:37:18| I'm sorry he's not here to speak to this directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| He assures me that the information that Mr. Mays is sharing with you is incomplete and inaccurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5841)|
| 1:37:27| But Mr. Mays is here and Tom is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| So all I can do is suggest that, one, I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| I think if there was demonstrable evidence that there was a safety issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| the federal authorities would have already intervened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5856)|
| 1:37:39| And, two, we'll be glad to speak to Mr. Mays about it again tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5859)|
| 1:37:43| But I am not a subject matter expert on fecal coliform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5863)|
| 1:37:48| and I'm not equipped to say a whole lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| But we'd be glad to sit down with Mr. Mays and compare our test results to his, and we'll do it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5871)|
| 1:37:55| Well, you know, you don't even, I tell you, you don't even have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| But I would just like to hear from the county that the product is safe, and I'll accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5878)|
| 1:38:03| That's, if Mr. Salter says it's okay, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| But I just want a straight answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5887)|
| 1:38:08| I mean, I don't mean that you're trying to evade the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| but when you're saying we can't talk about it because it's in court, if it's a safe answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| if the product is safe, in your opinion, by the rules and regulations that we have to go by, that's all I want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5895)|
| 1:38:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| And, again, Mr. Salter, in his absence, I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5903)|
| 1:38:27| because unlike Mr. Mays, I'm not a subject matter expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5907)|
| 1:38:30| But Mr. Salter takes issue with the assertions of Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Yes, Mark Jones, you're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| Good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| Would you look into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5925)|
| 1:38:47| I agree with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5927)|
| 1:38:48| We have a citizen here who's making some accusations, and I would like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5928)|
| 1:38:54| and I'm not expecting you to answer this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| I'm just asking you, as the health director for Knox County, I know that you're very concerned about public health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5942)|
| 1:39:03| At our next meeting or if you would look into this and maybe send us a letter or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| I would just like to ask you to do that to show that this indeed is not harming the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| or if it is, what needs to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| Commissioner, I am not sure what Mr. Mays, the information he's given you, but I'll be glad to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5962)|
| 1:39:23| Yeah, can we get the EPA people that he's talking about to come down and talk to us about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| I've got a sample right here I'm going to give Mr. Rosenberg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5969)|
| 1:39:32| If he wants to take it, he can give those to the rest of the folks on the latest results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5972)|
| 1:39:36| If he wants to take that to their experts or Mr. Salter, he can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| The thing I just want to remind you all about is we have thousands and thousands of yards of this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5980)|
| 1:39:47| piled on our property, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| And just because you get rid of the sludge at the end of this month don't mean the sales stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| It's going to take them years to sell all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| It's going to take them years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| We can't just stop taking sludge and quit looking at how this material sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| I was looking at their 07 data, and they actually produced twice as much material as they sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6004)|
| 1:40:11| They produced like 39,000 tons of biosolid containing material, and they only sold 20,000 tons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6011)|
| 1:40:18| It's no wonder they've been running out of space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| Commissioner Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6021)|
| 1:40:22| I still had the floor, I think, didn't I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6022)|
| 1:40:24| Yeah, a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6024)|
| 1:40:25| I never did quit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6025)|
| 1:40:26| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6026)|
| 1:40:27| I just want to ask Mr. Mays, can you get the EPA people to come down here with you and back up what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6027)|
| 1:40:32| I know your brain isn't writing, but I'd like to hear them from their mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| I was actually requested today by Mr. Hom to send him copies of all these tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| I've sent him some of them to document some of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| And he expressed he had some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| I'd say we'll probably have the EPA pay us a visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| I didn't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6050)|
| 1:40:51| And there's a reason why I didn't want to get the EPA involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| The reason is that there was an operational bonding requirement in this RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| It said the contractor is responsible for operational bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| And I'm thinking that they're --it's my impression they were speaking about the bonding to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6062)|
| 1:41:07| that's required in case of a potential cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6067)|
| 1:41:10| This contractor has no operational bonding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| And had you all put up close to a half a million dollars in contracting performance bond to the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| and put the taxpayer on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6085)|
| 1:41:27| I guess if these levels, Mr. Mays, and I'm not saying they're not, if they're this high, you know, I'm a contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6087)|
| 1:41:36| and obviously I use a tremendous amount of mulch on the projects I build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6096)|
| 1:41:42| So, you know, I guess I'm concerned that, you know, even if let's say the county says we're doing nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6102)|
| 1:41:50| I'm concerned that the state and EPA both haven't already been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| I mean, obviously, you've told us on numerous occasions that you've spoken with different peoples at the state level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6116)|
| 1:42:03| at the EPA level, and yet for them not to come in and do an inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6123)|
| 1:42:07| I mean, if I'm a state or federal employee and I see this, I would shut the place down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6127)|
| 1:42:14| Well, the thing is, the last time this happened, they supposedly found the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6134)|
| 1:42:18| and pulled the products off the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| So what I did is I waited a month and ran another sample to see if that was the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| And I got the results back today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| And this don't even cover this $27,000 double bill, I feel is a double bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| They've admitted under oath that they were paid tipping fees to dispose of brush that was dumped in a low spot off the end of the concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6153)|
| 1:42:40| This happened for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6160)|
| 1:42:41| It amassed a huge pile of brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| The state got on to clean it up, and they hired a contractor to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| and sent you all the bill and you all paid for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| This has been admitted under oath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| I've got Mr. Rodney Rockett's deposition right here where he confirmed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| They were paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| I don't know how much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| I've got satellite photographs to show that the brush was there before Earthworks done the land clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6183)|
| 1:43:08| So it didn't come from the Earthworks land clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6188)|
| 1:43:10| I've got aerials and satellites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6190)|
| 1:43:12| There's this huge pile of brush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6192)|
| 1:43:14| TDEC got on them because it was on the perimeter of a sinkhole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| They said, you can't have it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| Gave them so many days to clean it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| Now, I was told by one person that their tub grinder was broke down at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6201)|
| 1:43:24| So they hired an individual contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| And there's a dispute on that story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| But they hired a third-party contractor to come up here and grind all this brush up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| They'd been paid tipping fees for it to dispose of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| And the third-party contractor comes up here, grinds it all up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6215)|
| 1:43:40| and also provides this contractor with parts for his tub grinder that we're yet to determine if they were included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| in the invoice or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6226)|
| 1:43:47| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6227)|
| 1:43:48| But he comes up here, grinds all this up, provides him some parts for his tub grinder, bills him $27,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6228)|
| 1:43:55| And the very next day, they sent the invoice to you and you paid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| And this don't count the other rental agreement that I found where your solid waste department rented about four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6239)|
| 1:44:04| or five acres of Knox County's property to a grading contractor for five years, and you all never knew about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6244)|
| 1:44:10| You all never got a penny out of that rental agreement on the same piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6250)|
| 1:44:14| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6254)|
| 1:44:18| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| I just wanted to reiterate and add to what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6263)|
| 1:44:35| I want you to do your own testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| I want you to go out and do your own testing of this material and also take into consideration this is an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6277)|
| 1:44:46| where folks have wells and make sure that everything is safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| that nothing unsafe is going into the ground that could contaminate the well water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6292)|
| 1:44:59| This is my district and that is an area where some folks are still using wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| Can you do that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| Commissioner, I mean, we don't have the capacity to go out and do our own testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| I mean, we would have to contract with someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| You couldn't go out and take the samples and take them to an independent testing facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6313)|
| 1:45:21| I don't know if we have someone on staff that can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| I could check and see and we can look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| If I go out there, if I get the samples myself and take them to Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| can you analyze the data and, of course, pay for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6333)|
| 1:45:39| You're going to pay for it yourself too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| What does it cost to have samples tested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6341)|
| 1:45:44| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6344)|
| 1:45:45| I mean, I don't want to commit, you know, $1,000 worth of testing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6345)|
| 1:45:50| We are looking into doing the Tedford Road testing, a second round of water testing out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6350)|
| 1:45:55| So, but we're not, our staff is not going to actually go out and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6355)|
| 1:45:59| We're going to be involved in making sure it gets done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6359)|
| 1:46:04| I don't have staff that probably can do this kind of test, nor can our lab do this test either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6364)|
| 1:46:11| Here's where I'm at, and, again, this is my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6371)|
| 1:46:15| and these are my citizens that are drinking water from wells in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6375)|
| 1:46:20| My citizens have had a lot of trouble with the odor issue that I think we've finally dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| But I'm hearing this gentleman come back month after month with these really scary sounding reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6386)|
| 1:46:35| Yet, when you talk to Mr. Salter, it seems like he paints a different picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6395)|
| 1:46:42| I want a third independent analysis done of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6402)|
| 1:46:45| And if you say that you're not able to do that, then I'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6405)|
| 1:46:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6413)|
| 1:46:54| But, I mean, I would have thought under the health department that you would have the ability to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6414)|
| 1:46:59| and have samples tested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| Again, Commissioner, it depends on what kind of samples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| I mean, we do different kinds of samples, and we do well water sampling for bacteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6423)|
| 1:47:08| We don't test for all the chemicals that's needed to test and for the other situation at Tedford Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6428)|
| 1:47:14| And I'm just being pulled into this right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| I don't know what kind of tests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| And I'm not trying to be confrontational with you, but I just thought that if anybody in county government had the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6439)|
| 1:47:26| to put some dirt in a bag and send it off to be tested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| that the health department would be the department that would have the ability to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6456)|
| 1:47:37| He said he wasn't, so let's move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6457)|
| 1:47:39| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6459)|
| 1:47:40| I'm going to keep this short because we've beaten this thing to death just about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6460)|
| 1:47:44| I just think that what we need to do is just to review the records that we have, let the solid waste manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6464)|
| 1:47:51| the health department just look at what we have and see if there's any irregularities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6471)|
| 1:47:56| and let them come back with their opinion that it's safe or not safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6476)|
| 1:47:59| That's really all we need to do rather than retesting and this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6479)|
| 1:48:04| I didn't ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6484)|
| 1:48:06| I will make myself available to the health department to answer their questions and provide my files.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6486)|
| 1:48:11| Commissioner DeFries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6491)|
| 1:48:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| I concur with Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| And, you know, every single resolution that we pass here, it always ends with the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080527businesspart2?start=6496)|
