| 0:08:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Now, sir, have you all applied for a state liquor license, liquor permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| Well, I asked the Virginia, the one that takes the ABC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| Is that ABC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=496)|
| 0:08:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| He said it's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Like, we can apply for the liquor and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| But we can't grant you, based on your zoning, we can't grant you a beer license unless you get a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| So I have to get a liquor license first and then the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| It would, that state liquor license trumps our beer permit, beer laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=511)|
| 0:08:36| and so we can't vote to give you a beer permit...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Until we get a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Until you get a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Liquor license, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| And so what, I don't want to make him reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| Can we just table it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| We can do it pending the inspections and also pending a state license issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| And so if you got your state license and inspected, we can grant it to you based on those three things happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| So you've got to get your state license, health department inspection, fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Fire inspection, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=547)|
| 0:09:08| So we can apply against for the beer...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=548)|
| 0:09:11| You don't have to reapply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=551)|
| 0:09:12| Once you get the liquor license, your beer license will be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=552)|
| 0:09:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| So I will make a motion that we do so, pending the state liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=555)|

| 0:26:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1590)|

| 0:26:37| Oh, he's coming down to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| My comment is related to a chance meeting that Commissioner Oynbee and I had the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| Knox County had a delinquent property tax sale, and as people may notice every now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1608)|
| 0:26:57| I went to the sale of the mulch facility, the sale of the surplus property of the Gibbs Convenience Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1617)|
| 0:27:04| the tax sale last year, and the tax sale this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1624)|
| 0:27:09| There was a room full of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| and I appreciate the action of the delinquent property tax lawyer that's in the law director's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1631)|
| 0:27:22| in cooperation with the trustee to get property taxes current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1642)|
| 0:27:28| or get them into possession of someone who will get them current because that's what state law requires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1648)|
| 0:27:38| And I just wanted to recognize the trustee for having done that, and, Commissioner Oynbee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| I didn't know whether you wanted to, if you, I'm through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1670)|
| 0:27:51| Yeah, I just want to take a few moments to thank Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1671)|
| 0:27:55| It was a well-run, well-organized, and I was very pleased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1675)|
| 0:28:04| Like Dave, it was a chance meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| I didn't know Dave was going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| But it was very well-run, and it's nice to be able to get these properties back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| But your team, in conjunction with the law department, did a very good job organizing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1697)|
| 0:28:23| I just want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1704)|

| 0:28:34| Two of them are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1714)|

| 0:28:40| And Justin Biggs, who's over our collection department now, and they've done an excellent job, too, bringing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| They actually go out and just try to talk to the customers, or to the taxpayers, before it goes to a tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1727)|
| 0:28:53| And I appreciate, I didn't expect to come in here and talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| I'll give you a 30-second snapshot of what happened, if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| I hate to admit it, it's still a learning process for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| I'm not a tax sale expert by any means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Much thanks to Daniel Sanders on Mr. Armstrong's staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| He's our tax sale attorney in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| He spends a lot of his time down in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| But just a snapshot of what happened that day on the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| Ninety-four properties were sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| We don't like doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| We would prefer the taxpayer come in and pay the taxes so they don't go to a tax sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| because there's a lot of red tape, and title searches, and all kinds of opinions have to be put together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| and the people have to be served with papers, and some have to be properly served by the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| which Justin's group does most of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| Of the 94 properties that were sold, 51 were sold to individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| That being people, the room was full of mainly real estate investors, speculators, entrepreneurs, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1789)|
| 0:29:57| Fifty-one were sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| A total of $861,000 property was purchased that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| Forty-two were not sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| They were actually sold to Knox County, and that's another process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| Ultimately, most of that will wind up in Hugh Holt's department at a county surplus sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| You guys will be voting on that property, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| It's deemed surplus, and that's when other people walk in and try to really bargain basement shop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| The Knox County properties will run the one-year redemption period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| and then, as I said, go through the county commission and the insolvency board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1829)|
| 0:30:34| which I know that's a very famous thing that many of several of you are on, isn't it, the insolvency board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1834)|
| 0:30:41| The county purchasing department will then try to sell all these surplus properties through a bidding process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| to get them back on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| That's the main goal, to get these on the tax roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| The trustee's office did an additional $334,000 in this tax sale more than the previous tax sale, which was 19A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1851)|
| 0:31:00| That's $334,000, which will flow through our office additionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| As we speak, Robin gave me, again, my staff does all the work and gives me the numbers and does all the red tape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| She gave me this just about an hour ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| have been chosen for our tax sale 20, which will be held late this year, probably in November of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1877)|
| 0:31:26| So if you're interested in the property that's going on the market, it's unfortunate that people have chosen not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1886)|
| 0:31:35| or maybe cannot pay the taxes for one reason or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| We'll certainly advertise that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| It's in the sentinels online, so anybody's welcome to come to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1900)|
| 0:31:45| Again, the main goal, however, is to get the taxpayer to pay the taxes so it doesn't go to tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1905)|
| 0:31:52| So it's a carrot and stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| That's up to the last minute almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| They've got the option of paying the taxes to keep it out of the tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| Quite frankly, though, there's some people around town, some developers and some property owners that all of us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1922)|
| 0:32:08| that decide the property's got a negative value, and so they let it go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| That's also a strategy that some real estate people play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| Let it go and let the county have it, see if anybody else wants to come pay something for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| or just let the county have it to get it off their books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| So I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you, and I appreciate Commissioner and Mrs. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| and Commissioner and Mrs. Olby coming in that day, and hopefully more of you will attend our next tax sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1948)|
| 0:32:34| Any questions for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| See, I'm still learning, trying to learn something every day or lots of things every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1956)|
| 0:32:42| Thank you, Ed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| Just as a reminder, we can't buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1964)|
| 0:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| Just to let everybody know, I didn't purchase anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| What we're going to do, we're going to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| One thing we're going to take up real quick, take care of real quick, Commissioner Olby,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| is item resolution 103, honoring the Webb football team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| So if we'll go ahead, Clark, if you'll read that in the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| A resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| honoring the Webb School of Knoxville football team for winning the state championship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| whereas the Webb School of Knoxville football team recently prevailed over Battleground Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| to win the coveted TSSAA Division II, a state championship title,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| whereas remarkably the 38-21 victory earned the Webb School its third straight state championship title| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| and eighth in program history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| and whereas the Webb School football team completed this season with a strong 10-3 record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| and whereas Head Coach David Meske, together with his assistant coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2021)|
| 0:33:45| provided the leadership and direction of the team's continued success this season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| and whereas the Knox County Commission desires to congratulate and recognize all team members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| for their stellar performance this season in capturing another state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2035)|
| 0:33:59| Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Commission of Knox County as follows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2039)|
| 0:34:03| the Commission of Knox County hereby honors the Webb School of Knoxville football team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| and coaching staff for an outstanding 2014 season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| which culminated in winning their third consecutive TSSAA Division II, a state championship title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| Be it further resolved that this resolution is to take effect from and after its passage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| as provided by the Charter of Knox County, Tennessee, the public welfare requiring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| We have a motion to second. Commissioner Albee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2072)|
| 0:34:35| I'll present this to you, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| Can you pull the mic down to you, Jeff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2077)|
| 0:34:39| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I want to congratulate you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| Webb is not in my district, but I felt that they need to be recognized just as well as the public school systems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2084)|
| 0:34:51| that win national, or national, I wish it was that high, state titles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2091)|
| 0:34:56| But to win three in a row is a huge accomplishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| To win one is good, but to win three shows that the leadership and what you teach your boys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2101)|
| 0:35:09| and your staff working so diligently to achieve this goal is something that these boys will take on forever and ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2109)|
| 0:35:19| And I appreciate your leadership in this community as well as for this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2124)|

| 0:36:06| Is there anybody from Fulton or West here today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2166)|

| 0:37:48| Thank you, Lord, that we live in a country where we can meet and decide our own fates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| It's not something that's dictated to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| As you be with us as we go through this meeting today and give us the knowledge and discernment and the wisdom we need to make the right decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2275)|
| 0:38:03| and as you forgive us of our sins, these things we ask in Christ's name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2287)|

| 0:38:23| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2303)|
| 0:38:30| one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2310)|

| 0:39:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2381)|
| 0:39:42| Before we go any further, I need to go ahead and if the commission will allow, I forgot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| Mr. Elmore and Chris, if you all want to come down for the discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2387)|
| 0:39:53| I believe it's listed as a discussion item in regards to the PEP grant or the PEP fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2393)|
| 0:40:11| If we could just get your name and address for the record, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2411)|
| 0:40:14| Larry Elmore, 1634 Wembley Hill Road, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2414)|
| 0:40:19| Chris, do you want to go ahead and go to the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2419)|
| 0:40:29| This is more than just the PU funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| I can spend two hours with you guys like I did with the audit committee on the 12th of January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2433)|
| 0:40:39| or I can do this in about ten minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| We prefer the discounted rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| Seriously, we did spend a great deal of time, probably was two hours, on January the 12th with the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2447)|
| 0:40:53| You have a great audit committee, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| I think they're very qualified, and you have a very diverse group of individuals there that are very experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2455)|
| 0:41:01| in various facets of the business world, and it's a great team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| I brought hard copies of these reports today in case those of you who were interested may have need to refer to it as we talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2469)|
| 0:41:17| But you have two documents there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| One's called the audit committee letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| It's in your cover there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| It says report to the county commission and audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| And then the other one deals with grants and federal and state awards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| I'm happy to report to you that in doing our audit this year, it went very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| We got full cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| And you can see from the report that it was a very detailed audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| and a very thorough audit that covered a lot of areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2505)|
| 0:41:49| We do have some suggestions that resulted from the audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2509)|
| 0:41:52| and I guess that's where you want me to spend my time today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2512)|
| 0:41:57| So if you turn to page, take the document that's headed up, schedule of expenditures of federal and state awards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2517)|
| 0:42:13| and you go to page 16, this kind of summarizes our report as far as types of findings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2533)|
| 0:42:21| We had one material weakness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| We had three significant deficiencies and one compliance finding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2544)|
| 0:42:30| No findings related to major federal programs, which is very significant, very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2550)|
| 0:42:36| So turn to page 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| Some of these I won't spend so much time on because there's been a lot of coverage on them in the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2559)|
| 0:42:45| and discussions about various things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| The first one, actually, we can't spend a lot of time on because there are investigations continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| that are involving the sheriff's department and the DA's office and comptroller's office from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2574)|
| 0:43:01| So on page 17, we simply, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| stated that there had been some accusations within the school system about the credit cards over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2585)|
| 0:43:12| and also within the nutrition department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| and that these ongoing investigations were still in progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| But this one required us to actually file with the state of Tennessee what's called a fraud report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2600)|
| 0:43:28| And a fraud report with the state of Tennessee is required any time that you even have an allegation of fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| So it doesn't mean it's been proven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| It doesn't mean that anybody has come forth and said that it actually did happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2616)|
| 0:43:42| But the state requires you to file a one-page document, requires us to file a one-page document with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2622)|
| 0:43:49| any time there's even an allegation of fraud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| So we filed it this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| We'll have to follow up next year when the thing is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| Hopefully it will be resolved by the next audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| And we have to put the results of that investigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2639)|
| 0:44:05| So this one, our recommendation was that you basically get rid of those credit cards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2645)|
| 0:44:10| go completely to using the e-card program or what some call the P-card program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| because it has countywide consistent controls that are the same for everybody, easy to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2655)|
| 0:44:22| because everybody else is following that in all the other departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| And the school system has actually agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| I think they've already done it, actually, canceled those cards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| and are currently implementing the issuances of P-cards instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2672)|
| 0:44:38| Those cards all had, I think, generally about a $5,000 credit limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| but they've all been canceled at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2683)|
| 0:44:48| Finding number two, this is the one that relates to the criminal court clerk's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2688)|
| 0:44:56| and has received a lot of publicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| I'd like to say, first of all, the money was not missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2701)|
| 0:45:06| You can't find money that wasn't missing, so it's been there forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2706)|
| 0:45:10| The funds were actually recorded on the general ledger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2710)|
| 0:45:14| They've been sitting there for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| There's been no, from what we could tell, no fraud involved in those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2716)|
| 0:45:23| There's actually a liability account that's set up on the same set of books that is kind of a contra account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2723)|
| 0:45:34| so you have a cash account at the bank and then you have a liability account that shows that we actually owe that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| to either the state or partially to the county, partially to other government agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2740)|
| 0:45:47| The extent of it, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| And that's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| The other misconception that's been out there is that the account was not audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| It was audited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| This is our third audit that we've done here with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Now, I can't speak for audits the other 47 years when this account's been sitting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2760)|
| 0:46:05| but the three years that we've been here, we have confirmed the balance of the bank account at the bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| sent a confirmation independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| They confirmed the balance as being correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| We compared it to last year and looked at the activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| We actually audited some of the activity, looked at some of the increases, some of the decreases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| looked at documentation that that was represented by those, and then confirmed both, as I said, the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| and the back end, the beginning of the year and the end of the year balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| So there was audit work done, at least for the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2795)|
| 0:46:39| The problem with this account is that in this liability portion of the account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| you can't really ask for a detail that says, okay, this amount was paid by Joe Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2807)|
| 0:46:55| this account was paid by Johnny Smith, whatever, that makes up the total $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| So we know that the balance is owed either to the state of Tennessee or Knox County or other government agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2821)|
| 0:47:08| The office just cannot produce a listing of who paid all these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| Now, to take it further, there is a, as disclosed here on page 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| the criminal clerk's office does have files that we have examined that support, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2841)|
| 0:47:30| if a person comes in and makes a payment and they pay $50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| This fund actually represents all money that's been paid as progress payments on an unpaid fine or fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2853)|
| 0:47:42| So if the person does not pay the full fee up front, it's been going into this account as a partial payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2862)|
| 0:47:52| Now that they are looking back and seeing how it's been handled, it should have been paid as it was collected, in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2872)|
| 0:47:59| But it's not been done that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| So over accumulation of many, many years, it's grown to $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2881)|
| 0:48:07| They do have files, as I said, representing certain of the individuals who have been making these progress payments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| and they can go back to the files and see how much has been paid, when it was paid, and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| We can't verify that they can produce all of the $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| In fact, in discussions this morning even, just to get a follow-up on the status, they're not sure where all the files are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2902)|
| 0:48:30| They're not sure if they can all even be located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| Quite frankly, some of these people may be deceased now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2914)|
| 0:48:37| So there is no cumulative listing of who paid the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2917)|
| 0:48:47| However, on the positive side, there is cash sitting there for the same amount that the liability is for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| And like I said earlier, it wasn't found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| It's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2936)|
| 0:48:57| It's always been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| So our recommendation on this was that you begin discussions with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2939)|
| 0:49:06| and with the county law department and CTAS to figure out who to pay this to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| But let's get it cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| The account has been, from discussions this morning, I understand the account has been frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| There's been reports that it has been closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| It hasn't been closed because when you close an account, it gets dispersed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| So it's been frozen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| And they're in discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| I think Chris can tell you more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| But they've had phone conversations with the state about who to talk to and how to get this started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| So questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| I know another suggestion that we have on this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2983)|
| 0:49:56| and I think it's already been implemented, that no more progress payments to be recorded in this manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=2996)|
| 0:50:01| As progress payments get made, they should be dispersed immediately to whoever they're owed to so that you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3001)|
| 0:50:06| within the same month, so that this doesn't build up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3006)|
| 0:50:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| Page 19 is a recommendation about fixed assets, construction in progress, and PPUs, physical plant upgrades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| And our recommendation in here was that, first of all, that PPUs get classified correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3023)|
| 0:50:29| as opposed to being put into the project itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| It should be recorded as a PPU so that it can be monitored and budgeted properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| And also, this is a two-pronged recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| The other part being that when things go into construction in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| that they be monitored and moved to fixed assets upon completion, as opposed to being left in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| As we found this year, some items had been left in there a couple of years, up to a couple of years after they had been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3053)|
| 0:50:59| So the problem there is depreciation needs to start on those assets as soon as they're complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3059)|
| 0:51:06| They should be moved over to the fixed asset records and start depreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3066)|
| 0:51:13| There again, the county agreed with that finding and has already been making steps to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3073)|
| 0:51:19| On page 20, the last finding as far as other than prior year was a finding related to a lease for 6,000 computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3079)|
| 0:51:32| that was incurred in July of 2013, so it would have been the first month of the last fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| A lease was entered into for almost $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3100)|
| 0:51:45| The lease had not been recorded on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3105)|
| 0:51:48| There had been one payment made in July of 2013 for about $1.4 million, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3108)|
| 0:51:56| And as you know, in the world of accounting, there are two in your CAFR, your annual report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3116)|
| 0:52:07| there are two methods of recording the accounting records of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3127)|
| 0:52:10| One is fund accounting, which has been used for umpteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| The other is government-wide accounting where you actually use a cruel basis accounting and you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| you record things just like a for-profit company would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3139)|
| 0:52:23| So in fund accounting, this didn't make a difference because the payments would be expensed as they're incurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3143)|
| 0:52:31| other than the fact that there should have been, well, there was a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| The funding has to be done from the county to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| In other words, the schools cannot incur debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| So whenever you incur a lease or any obligation like this, the debt has to be done through the county as opposed to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3163)|
| 0:52:52| So that was not done, and then the lease itself was not recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| So it has now been recorded into the CAFR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| That's been fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| The reason this becomes a compliance finding is that the county has a policy that requires all debt to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3182)|
| 0:53:10| and advanced by Mr. Caldwell, and that was not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3190)|
| 0:53:16| And so the reason you have that is so that budgeting can be put in place properly and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3196)|
| 0:53:22| all the proper approvals can be had on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| Now, to make you feel better on this, this would have been discovered in the budget process this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3206)|
| 0:53:35| because in doing the budget for the following year, Chris would have had discussions with the county schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| and there would have been discussions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| So anytime we evaluate findings, one of the things we evaluate is how long could this have gone on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| without being discovered, and I think in this case it would have been caught within one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3229)|
| 0:53:55| So it was not a pervasive problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| It was not ñ there was no effort on anybody's part to hide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| It just slipped through the cracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| And then on page 21 is listing all the previous year findings that we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| Mr. Elmore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3252)|
| 0:54:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Before you move off of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3254)|
| 0:54:15| I didn't understand you to say a while ago that there's only been one payment made toward those computers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3255)|
| 0:54:21| Through June of 14, there was only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| Through June of 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| That's when the end ñ there's been one since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| There has been one since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3268)|
| 0:54:29| There's two now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| This only covers up to the end of June, this document that you're reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| It's about half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3276)|
| 0:54:37| It should be about half paid now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3277)|
| 0:54:45| Commissioner Longbeam?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3285)|
| 0:54:46| Yes, just before we get too far along, I'm kind of trying to keep my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3286)|
| 0:54:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| And so we don't have to go back as far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| Back on the credit cards, I know we've made steps and we've corrected that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| and done away with the credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| Do we know how much late fees and other things that was accrued on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3303)|
| 0:55:09| Would that have been on the audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3309)|
| 0:55:12| Well, if you remember, the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and the commission authorized the internal auditor to go into that as opposed to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| We did do enough work during our audit to determine that we could not see that it was going to be a material effect on our audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3321)|
| 0:55:30| Other than that, we kind of backed off because we didn't want to, first of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| Yeah, because there's an investigation, so we don't want to get into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| No, I can't answer the dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3337)|
| 0:55:38| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| That's what I thought was the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I wanted to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| When the internal audit report is issued, that will probably be in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| Okay, and on the PPU, I kind of circled a couple of things here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3346)|
| 0:55:56| And that was the point that I brought up about the PPU, that if we don't pinpoint it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| and we don't put it where it needs to go on what project, it's not capitalized properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| It's hard to track down exactly what we spend on a project and all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3366)|
| 0:56:13| And I'm glad that steps are going to be made to make sure that this doesn't occur again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| because it needs to be capitalized properly, not as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| Well, in the monitoring process that is set up to monitor those projects can't be done properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3384)|
| 0:56:29| if they're not categorized properly on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3389)|
| 0:56:31| Yeah, and we don't know what's actually going with what project and where money's coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| The other thing, I read here that it says you recommend a semi-annual basis audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3397)|
| 0:56:45| like on the school projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| No, we're not recommending an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3407)|
| 0:56:49| We're recommending that the finance department twice a year look at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| to see if they need to be reviewed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3413)|
| 0:56:54| Just to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3414)|
| 0:56:55| Yeah, they can do that internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3415)|
| 0:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| That's all I have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3418)|
| 0:56:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| To follow on what Jeff just mentioned about the changes and all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| is that why we're hearing rumors of some over 300 PO changes in the last three weeks over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| I don't think that's a question for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| I have no knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3440)|
| 0:57:25| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| On page 21 is a listing of the prior year findings that we had in 2013 and 2012, as you read back through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3450)|
| 0:57:41| I'm happy to say that all those have been cleared, and so we have to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3461)|
| 0:57:47| We have to put them in here one more year just to show that they've been cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3467)|
| 0:57:50| So all those findings in the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3470)|
| 0:57:54| all those findings related to the previous year issues on capital asset records and also on the Davis-Bacon Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3474)|
| 0:58:02| those have all been cleared and no further problems with any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3482)|
| 0:58:14| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3494)|
| 0:58:20| In the other document, which is called the Audit Committee Letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| this document actually goes back to several years ago when WorldCom and Enron and all those issues came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| There was a feeling amongst the accounting world that audit committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| and governing bodies needed to be told more things about the results of the audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| as opposed to the audit report just appearing in the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3523)|
| 0:58:47| So the disclosures that are in this document are all required to be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| such as whether the entity went into any new accounting standards or so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3531)|
| 0:58:57| A couple of things I'll point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| On page two at the top there, you see the four audit adjustments that we had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| one of them being a $4 million adjustment to the workman's compensation liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| based on an actuarial report that actually went back several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| but had not been being used to accrue those liabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3556)|
| 0:59:20| And so in order to effectuate that properly this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3560)|
| 0:59:23| there had to be a prior period adjustment to record that properly at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| The second one was the lease obligation we already talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| The third one was there was an accrual for some 2015 benefit plan contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3573)|
| 0:59:44| that were recorded too early, so I had to back them off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3584)|
| 0:59:52| Page three, and if I'm taking too much time, somebody tell me, but I'm just going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3592)|
| 0:59:58| Page three, we're required to tell you that, in our opinion, we are independent related to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3598)|
| 1:00:06| So here we want to make it clear that the various things we have done for you in the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3606)|
| 1:00:12| and we feel like that none of those, based on the standards of independence, have affected our independence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| because we have not become a part of your internal control system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3619)|
| 1:00:22| or gotten ingrained into the system that would impair our independence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| So we did some work, as you know, related to the trustee's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3628)|
| 1:00:32| some follow-up on findings there from the prior year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3632)|
| 1:00:35| We did some work for you on the changeover of elected officials in the trustee, criminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| Fourth Circuit, and General Sessions court office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3640)|
| 1:00:43| Went in basically on the day of the transition, looked at all the assets, looked at all the cash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3643)|
| 1:00:49| made sure the receipts and disbursements were properly changed over, signature cards changed, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3649)|
| 1:00:57| And then we did some consulting work with your new internal audit person, internal auditor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3657)|
| 1:01:03| to assist with some consulting in the area of program and documentation set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3663)|
| 1:01:09| and just trying to help any way we could to get that set up properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| Page four, five, and six show the significant accounting estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| One thing that most people are not aware of, as in any audit or in any set of financial statements, is full of estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| And so to think that an audit report is exact or a set of financial statements is exact is really a misnomer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3689)|
| 1:01:35| because when you look down through here, there's all kinds of estimates that are made in arriving at the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3695)|
| 1:01:41| such as the fair value of investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| So here this section of the document shows all the major estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3703)|
| 1:01:48| and then shows what we did to audit those estimates over on the far right-hand side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3708)|
| 1:01:58| Page seven are the audit adjustments, page seven and eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| Seven shows the effect on the fund financial statements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| and eight shows the effect on the government-wide statements, which I talked about a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3727)|
| 1:02:15| And that's pretty much a quick rundown on those two documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3735)|
| 1:02:21| Any questions for Mr. Elmore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3741)|
| 1:02:26| I'd just like to thank Mr. Elmore for bringing this to us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| At the audit committee meeting, he had made the full presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| and Commissioner Wright and myself felt like this was something that the rest of you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3753)|
| 1:02:40| at least could use a quick run-by on because this is something that affects all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3760)|
| 1:02:50| And I see a lot of positive things in here, and I think we're moving in the right direction in a lot of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3770)|
| 1:02:56| So I would just like to say personally thank you, Larry, for the work you're doing for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3776)|
| 1:03:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| And just to follow that up, the most positive thing about all this, and I would definitely agree with Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3782)|
| 1:03:09| we have never in the three years we've done the audit seen any pushback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| or any feeling that not everybody wanted to cooperate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| We've just received great cooperation from finance, from the schools, from all the fee offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| and there really is the feeling here in Knox County government that let's use the audit to improve things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3802)|
| 1:03:30| not necessarily having a gotcha type of attitude, but let's find out what we need to change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| and improve and move forward, and I think that was proven out with the trustee's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| That trustee's office is clean based on this audit report this year, all those prior year findings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3821)|
| 1:03:48| and going extremely well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3830)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you, Larry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3834)|
| 1:04:02| Chris Coughlin at Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3842)|
| 1:04:03| First I'd like to say it's a pleasure to work with Larry and Pew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3843)|
| 1:04:07| It's always a good relationship, and we give them a hard time, but we always enjoy having them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3847)|
| 1:04:15| I want to clarify something for Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| The 300 PO changes, I was talking to Matt Myers, he's the deputy for Hugh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3858)|
| 1:04:26| and it's basically 334 line changes, so it's not POs in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3866)|
| 1:04:32| Each PO may have 25 or 35 lines, okay, and so what happened was an individual at schools put in several POs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3872)|
| 1:04:43| but put in the wrong accounting information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3883)|
| 1:04:48| When they realized that it was incorrect as far as the accounting, then they went back and had to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| So that's a change order, but there was a change of 334 lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3895)|
| 1:05:00| but it was basically due to the changing of accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| Did it affect his audit any when it was done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| Because the audit was done before these were changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| Change orders would be looked at by our auditing firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| They're going to look at POs and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| but as long as a change order is justified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3921)|
| 1:05:25| and purchasing wouldn't do a change order unless they were comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| and basically it's just a change of work codes is my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3929)|
| 1:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3935)|
| 1:05:36| You want to talk about Jason?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Jason Lay, our controller for Knox County, has accepted a position to be the finance director for Helen Ross McNabb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3940)|
| 1:05:48| I know many of you all got to know Jason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| He's done great work for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| I hate to see him leave, but it's an opportunity that he cannot pass up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| so we'll be hiring a position, someone for that position fairly soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| but feel free to wish Jason good luck, and I'm sure you'll see him around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=3963)|

| 1:13:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| I've said all these things before, but I'm going to say them again today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4439)|
| 1:14:03| When you look at the audience out there, when you take away the county people, the school people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4443)|
| 1:14:10| and Cynthia, I don't see any John Q. public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| And that's the way it is every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| And I don't believe the change to 5 o'clock is going to make it any better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4459)|
| 1:14:22| because the items that we normally discuss 99 times out of 100 at our general commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4462)|
| 1:14:29| are not items that affect one person individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| We're dealing with items that affect 400,000 people in the total of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4473)|
| 1:14:40| If we move it to 5 o'clock, Chris has already told us it's going to cost an extra $10,000 for security work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4480)|
| 1:14:50| plus the overtime or whatever for the five or six ladies up here on the stage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4490)|
| 1:14:57| and the inconvenience of all of the department heads and all of their underlings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| that they need to bring to the meeting who normally would be going home at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4503)|
| 1:15:07| Now they're going to have to stay here until 5, 6, or 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Then we move the zonings to 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4511)|
| 1:15:15| Tonight's going to be a good example for you because we've got a couple of things that are going to take a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| So don't expect to be out here by 5, 15 tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| It ain't going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4525)|
| 1:15:28| This puts the general public getting home, you know, it may be midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4528)|
| 1:15:35| Who knows on some of these long contentious ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| But I always live by the old adage, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| So I'd like to make a substitute motion to leave things as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Is there a second on the substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4553)|
| 1:15:58| I think a failure of the first would leave things as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| So Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| You know, as Commissioner Brown said, we've discussed this a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4567)|
| 1:16:12| and this recommendation came out of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| I guess I just fundamentally disagree with most of what Commissioner Brown says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4578)|
| 1:16:25| Basically what he's saying is no one cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| No one cares.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| They don't come because they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| And I disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| I think they don't come because they work and they can't get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4597)|
| 1:16:43| As I said before, I've been on this body a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| I'm one of the longest serving members, and I work way over 40 hours a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| So this doesn't affect me personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4610)|
| 1:16:53| So this isn't something that I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4613)|
| 1:16:56| But I just disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| They do care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4617)|
| 1:16:58| When we have issues, what we'll say, oh, it's 2 o'clock, let's wait until later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| to give members of the public time to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4626)|
| 1:17:10| They do care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| They, and I speak of them like they're one voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| They're 400,000 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Yeah, they're not going to all show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4638)|
| 1:17:19| But if we met later, I think the numbers prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4639)|
| 1:17:23| People come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| So if we just want to sit here and have them watch it on TV later, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| But if we say we want to be a public, transparent body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4649)|
| 1:17:34| then I think we need to move the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| And that's why I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| Tonight's not going to be a good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4660)|
| 1:17:43| We haven't had a hotly contested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4663)|
| 1:17:46| we've had very few hotly contested zoning issues in the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| So tonight will be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| But that's not typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| We always want to throw out these outliers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| I mean, I was here at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| That was a one-time thing, and that meeting actually started early that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| So, you know, I think as we look at this, let's look at the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4684)|
| 1:18:10| The facts are when we want people to talk about something, we push it back to later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| And I think that is for a reason, because we understand what the typical workday is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4696)|
| 1:18:22| And so financially, we've just sat here on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| I mean, if you actually looked at the lot item transfers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| what you just brought up, 10K and a few hours of overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4712)|
| 1:18:37| a couple of hours, two days a month, it's in the noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| if we're going to be a better service to our constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4722)|
| 1:18:48| And I firmly believe moving this meeting time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4728)|
| 1:18:52| we'll be doing a better service to the people that elected all of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4732)|
| 1:18:57| that care about the things that we vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4737)|
| 1:19:02| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| I just feel like we are here to serve the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4747)|
| 1:19:11| and I think we should have our meetings at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| when the majority of the people have access to come to these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Participation may or may not go up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4757)|
| 1:19:20| but it's about giving them the opportunity to participate in our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| Commissioner Oldenburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4766)|
| 1:19:29| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| Over the last four months that we've been talking about this, I've went backwards and forwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4772)|
| 1:19:37| And although personally I'm fine with the way it is now, the times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4777)|
| 1:19:48| but the constituents that have contacted me over the last four months want the time changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| Don't know that it's going to improve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| I don't feel like it will improve attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4796)|
| 1:20:06| It's been changed before in the past, and nobody ever showed up then either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| unless it was something important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| And I still don't know how I'm going to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4815)|
| 1:20:18| But it's proof to me over the last four months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4818)|
| 1:20:23| the emails and the phone calls especially that I've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| or when I've went to meetings, I've asked this one question every single time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4826)|
| 1:20:31| Do you want to see the time change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| From 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock or to 5 o'clock, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| And everybody said, as long as it's after we get off from work, we can make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| Or close to when we're getting off work, we can come, or we'd like the opportunity to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4844)|
| 1:20:50| So I'm kind of torn between this, and I'm not sure quite yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| But I think there's a case on both sides to have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4855)|
| 1:21:01| And it's not a ñ to me it doesn't matter if it's now or at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| I'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| But for the public, and that's what we're here to serve as the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4870)|
| 1:21:13| it should be the time that they would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4873)|
| 1:21:17| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4877)|
| 1:21:19| Well, being the new commissioner, I certainly respect Commissioner Thomas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4879)|
| 1:21:24| and Commissioner Brantley, our at-large commissioners, for, I guess, bringing this issue to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4884)|
| 1:21:31| And apparently because of your travels around the county, that is what the public's been telling you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4891)|
| 1:21:38| And, of course, the governing body in my district in Farragut, they meet at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4898)|
| 1:21:44| So, you know, I kind of believe that if someone's making a campaign contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4904)|
| 1:21:50| for the benefit of the citizens of Knox County, I would certainly then support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| But, again, I'd like to hear just a little bit more from some of the other folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4916)|
| 1:22:02| and if you guys would like to weigh in too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4924)|
| 1:22:05| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| I guess all the thunder has clapped then as it came around the edge of the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| I may have been the first person to speak about changing the time when it first came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4933)|
| 1:22:23| And what I said was if it cost us money, I'd be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4943)|
| 1:22:30| Well, I did not realize that there may be a balance between the expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4950)|
| 1:22:39| and the participation of people that would come to the meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| So in months gone by, I believe that this change in time would have failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4965)|
| 1:22:56| But I think now that the discussion is open and it's going to be tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| I too am looking for what input the county-wides have received on this particular circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4983)|
| 1:23:13| of changing the time and look forward to their input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| Well, last year when I was running for the seat and going around and talking around Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| this is one of the issues that people were talking to me about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5009)|
| 1:23:34| that not everyone even has the CTV channel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5014)|
| 1:23:39| So to participate in this, and I go back to one thing, I understand the objections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5019)|
| 1:23:45| but it works for city council, it works for other government agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| and I don't see why we're different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| We actually should be leading the way instead of not leading the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5031)|
| 1:23:56| So I encourage everyone to vote for the change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Commissioner Busseler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| I was asking some people around in my district what they felt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5042)|
| 1:24:07| and I got kind of mixed feelings out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| The people that were retired didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| The people that were working did care that it could be later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5052)|
| 1:24:17| I went to some other county commission meetings in other areas, Union County, Anderson County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| and they all have theirs at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| They have, you know, a good participation there at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5065)|
| 1:24:30| And I know when I was on the MPC, we started ours late in the afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5070)|
| 1:24:36| and at night the crowds just kept getting bigger and bigger when the work time started going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5076)|
| 1:24:41| And then we went to a consent agenda and got through quicker and we had lesser crowds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| But I think what people want to do is they want to be part of this, and they don't know how to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| And they want to be involved, but they don't have the time to be involved unless it's after work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5093)|
| 1:24:59| So, you know, like everybody else has said, if we want to be that committee that's going to lead the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5099)|
| 1:25:07| that's going to be transparent, that's going to say, hey, here it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| it's your time out there in the public to be part of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| then I think we've got to do something to make them come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| And I think that's one of the things we could do is change the time to see if they want to participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5117)|
| 1:25:23| and if they're willing to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5123)|
| 1:25:25| And at that time they can also find parking places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5125)|
| 1:25:31| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| First off, this was not a unanimous decision when it came from the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5137)|
| 1:25:44| It did prevail, but it was not a unanimous decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5144)|
| 1:25:48| And in my opinion, we can be just as transparent at 2 o'clock as we can be at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5148)|
| 1:26:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5161)|
| 1:26:02| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5162)|
| 1:26:03| Go ahead, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5163)|
| 1:26:04| Well, just as this came up last week and I was late for the meeting, the schedule is part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5164)|
| 1:26:12| I think there was a question about what the schedule looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| I think we're starting, I looked at Jill, this will start in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5175)|
| 1:26:19| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5179)|
| 1:26:20| March, I'm sorry, March, because to get over the January, February 3rd issues, 3rd Monday issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5180)|
| 1:26:31| but the schedule is part of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| That brings up another point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| Those changes that we'll have to make, sure we're going to miss some of them this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5197)|
| 1:26:41| but what happens next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| We're going to hit them next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| So you're going to have to have a social secretary to tell you what day you've got to go to meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5203)|
| 1:26:49| It's not going to be the 3rd Monday or the 4th Monday every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| I mean, just as an answer to that, we still hit the 3rd Mondays already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| I mean, those are issues that are before us regardless of this time change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| It's going to put us, I think what, in January we have the two Tuesdays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5226)|
| 1:27:11| or January, February we've got two Tuesdays that we always hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5231)|
| 1:27:14| Those are going to hit city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| You have one Tuesday in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| Right, and one in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5239)|
| 1:27:20| One in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5240)|
| 1:27:21| And then November and December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| November, no, those will just change the dates, move those dates back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5243)|
| 1:27:29| I don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5249)|
| 1:27:30| I can argue this either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| I think that moving it to the evening time is a positive, but I do not think that this schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5252)|
| 1:27:38| I think there's going to be some confusion when you do move the days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| because council is supposed to be in here at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| So you're going to have to completely change your days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5265)|
| 1:27:48| And then there are going to be times where you will be stopping commission to do zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| and you're going to hold up somebody that's here on a commission matter while you do zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| That's going to occur, and it's going to frustrate the process for people to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| And so it sounds like the room is, the numbers have been counted just by the statements today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| but there's going to be issues with this new schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5292)|
| 1:28:15| I think the zoning should be pulled from the commission day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5295)|
| 1:28:18| because I think you're clouding both of those, putting both of those into one day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5298)|
| 1:28:22| And I know they said the MP ski schedule won't work out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5302)|
| 1:28:25| but you may just have to set off zonings for a month to let the schedule catch up with itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| But I'm telling you, there's going to be a lot of problems with this schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| when you're stopping commission and going to zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| It's going to be confusing to people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| and you're going to have to pick another day of the month on two months to do your meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5319)|
| 1:28:45| That's confusing to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5325)|
| 1:28:46| There's consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| The consistency is a good thing, and it's going to confuse some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| You know, obviously it's going to pass today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| but you're going to hear some frustration as people are sitting in the audience on the zoning issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| while they're waiting on the commission issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5339)|
| 1:29:01| And those times are going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5341)|
| 1:29:02| You've got two or three months to do that for the budget, and it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5342)|
| 1:29:06| So keep that in mind as you evaluate whether this process works or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5346)|
| 1:29:11| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| As it sits, unless there's any other discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5354)|

| 1:30:08| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| Commissioner Thomas votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5409)|
| 1:30:10| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5410)|
| 1:30:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5411)|
| 1:30:12| Commissioner Brantley votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5412)|
| 1:30:13| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5413)|
| 1:30:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5415)|
| 1:30:16| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5416)|
| 1:30:17| 8-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5417)|
| 1:30:23| Okay, motion passes 8-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| Do we have to approve the whole schedule for the whole month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| You just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5438)|
| 1:30:41| Resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| One, authorizing the hiring of a lobbyist to keep the Knox County Commission apprised of proposed legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5443)|
| 1:30:49| which would affect Knox County and to lobby on behalf of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| And two, requesting the Knox County Purchasing Division to issue a request for proposals for lobbying services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| and to submit the most responsive proposal to the commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| Commissioner Brawls has asked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| She couldn't get it from a sick child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| She couldn't get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| So I asked it to be moved one more month, and I think that's going to be the last of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| So I'd like to make a motion we move it to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| Could I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| You can go ahead and speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| Could I speak to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5477)|
| 1:31:18| And it's not for or against, but in looking at her one and two, one probably puts the cart before the horse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5478)|
| 1:31:28| Could we not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5488)|
| 1:31:29| Now, maybe I'll look to purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| Could we not do an RFP?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| Do we have to fund it before we figure out what it's going to potentially cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| And that might be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| It would be nice to have to know what it's going to cost at least for a period of time that they'll itemize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| That way we'll know what we're voting up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| We can do an RFP and then get the process, and then we can just reject the RFPs and not do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5513)|
| 1:32:02| You know, I'm tempted to do a substitute motion and ask for that RFP to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5522)|
| 1:32:11| Again, just to have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5531)|
| 1:32:13| I think the conversation is worth having, and it's not costing us really anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| It doesn't cost you an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5537)|
| 1:32:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| You know, so it's probably not a bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| Would you form your substitute motion in the fact that a monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5543)|
| 1:32:28| to request for proposals for professional service on a monitoring,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5548)|
| 1:32:34| or a lobbyist to monitor Nashville bills that affect Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5554)|
| 1:32:38| Yeah, not necessarily try to dictate policy, but monitor policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| I think that's probably more appropriate for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5564)|
| 1:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| I was just wondering if going through that process has any effect on how any potential bidders might price the product,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5574)|
| 1:33:00| knowing that it's unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5580)|
| 1:33:06| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| I think you're going to have some parameters as far as how much time we expect to be spent at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5588)|
| 1:33:14| and maybe some other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Yeah, we're kind of going into it blind a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| But, I mean, you could, again, just thinking real time here, you could do fixed fee plus whatever hourly rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5597)|
| 1:33:23| That way, if we don't have any issues we're wanting to monitor, it's just a nominal fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5603)|
| 1:33:30| Hey, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5610)|
| 1:33:31| Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5611)|
| 1:33:34| Can we, over the next month, do you mind to check, and this may answer our question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5614)|
| 1:33:38| will you check with other counties our size, similar size, and see if they have lobbying contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| and see what they pertain to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| Kind of give us a model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| Yeah, so maybe I'll just rescind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| You just want to defer it maybe again until we get this information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| But his substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5632)|
| 1:33:53| So you're pulling your substitute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5633)|
| 1:33:55| Yeah, I'll pull my substitute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| Defer it one more month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5636)|
| 1:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| So we can do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Yeah, go ahead, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| I'll be glad to get that information and see what neighboring counties have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5640)|
| 1:34:03| We've certainly done this in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| Those contracts have expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| We did not renew those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| So we've done this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| You know, development, if you choose to go that way, relatively quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5650)|
| 1:34:14| The only concern I have is coming back and, you know, here's the best proposal and it's X company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5654)|
| 1:34:21| and we start saying, well, I don't necessarily like that name or that company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5661)|
| 1:34:26| I don't want to get in that situation with you all, us especially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| That's just ethically that's not good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5669)|
| 1:34:33| Could I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5673)|
| 1:34:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| That's a very good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| Is there a way for us to look at the financials and not look at the names necessarily?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5678)|
| 1:34:43| That's a purchasing question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5685)|
| 1:34:46| I think those could be redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| We can ask for a redacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| A blind RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Yeah, I tend to agree with your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| Here's your price range of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Do you want us to continue on and evaluate these and come back with the best proposal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5694)|
| 1:34:58| It may not be the cheapest, but we'd come back with the best proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5698)|
| 1:35:02| And that's a professional services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| It actually doesn't require a county commission vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| I mean, typically a professional service contract, you report to a, you know, to some state board, national board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5707)|
| 1:35:13| You know, you've got the American Bar Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| You've got the American Medical Association, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| I don't know that this fits in that box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5719)|
| 1:35:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5721)|
| 1:35:22| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| You know, you go to Sevier County, which is a good size county, they do not have a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5725)|
| 1:35:31| You go to some other counties around here, they do not have lobbyists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| The thing that we have that we already have that we don't utilize is a TCCA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| We've got Charlie Curtis that's on the floor every day now that is the EO of that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5740)|
| 1:35:50| He's down there doing lobbyists for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| What are we asking for from the lobbyists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| What do we want him to look at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| What do we want him to go to and give reports to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| There are three committees through the TCCA that we don't have anybody's representation on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| We have a legislative body, we have an educational policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| and we have a transportation which covers most of the things that we do that we can get that information from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5768)|
| 1:36:14| All we've got to do is tell them what we want them to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5774)|
| 1:36:18| and they can give us daily reports or they can call us if something comes up and let us know what's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5778)|
| 1:36:24| and they can call directly into our office and Joe Lee can get his e-mails right out to us if something comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5784)|
| 1:36:33| If they attach some rider to a bill that's going to affect us in some way, they will let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5793)|
| 1:36:39| We've just got to let them know what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5799)|
| 1:36:43| I don't understand why we're going to be spending money when we already got the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5803)|
| 1:36:47| and the implementation in there that that organization is paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5807)|
| 1:36:53| All we've got to do is utilize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| And why we're not utilizing it, I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| But I do call Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| I do call some other people down there to get information up that I see that comes out in the news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5821)|
| 1:37:07| How are we going to monitor it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| How are we going to know we're going to get our money's worth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5829)|
| 1:37:11| They don't tell us that the people we're getting is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| Does anybody have any contacts down there that they know who's the best down there for what we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5833)|
| 1:37:19| I worked in the lobbying down there in Nashville for the Home Builders Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5839)|
| 1:37:25| Now, there's a lot of things you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| If you want a good one, you're going to pay a lot of money for a good one to be on the floor every day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5847)|
| 1:37:31| monitoring just about everything that comes on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5851)|
| 1:37:33| We do have that in effect through that organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| So why don't we utilize the organization and see if we really need a lobbyist?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5857)|
| 1:37:41| Why do we want to go into a contract, spend money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| Why don't we have representation on the TCCA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5865)|
| 1:37:48| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| It's not down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5873)|
| 1:37:54| Well, I agree with Commissioner Ressler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| If we only want information, just the facts, then we could probably get it from some existing association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5876)|
| 1:38:03| or organization that we could join in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5883)|
| 1:38:07| But if we want a lobbyist to represent Knox County, I think you've got to be very particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5887)|
| 1:38:13| It's not just a money issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| These people are already married to other people, other companies, and other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| Almost all the major industries, major companies in Knox County have a lobbyist there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5900)|
| 1:38:25| The city of Knoxville has a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5905)|
| 1:38:28| It seems to me that the interests of the city of Knoxville and Knox County are very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5908)|
| 1:38:33| Possibly we could share their lobbyists and share that expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| and get the same information for both of us since we're in the same county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5917)|
| 1:38:42| And as a matter of fact, a couple of city councilmen since this has come up has mentioned that to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5922)|
| 1:38:48| that it's a possibility to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| That might be a cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5930)|
| 1:38:53| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| Thank you for everything you said, Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| You know, to Commissioner Bustler's point, I do understand fully that we do have representation down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5938)|
| 1:39:08| but I'll be pretty blunt in that TCCA represents all counties, and there is a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5948)|
| 1:39:18| There's a lot more rural counties, and I think that's where I came in last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5958)|
| 1:39:21| a lot more rural counties than urban counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| And as a tribe, before you buy it, let's ask TCCA if they could equalize the BEP formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| at least get a percentage of the two coming back our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| There will be a groundswell from their base, and their base is rural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| I mean, I'm being blunt, but that's their base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| And at the end of the day, you know, I forgot how many counties, 90-whatever is a lot more than four or five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5984)|
| 1:39:51| Yeah, 95 is a lot more than five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| And I understand that from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| And they represent us well in county issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| But if we want Knox County, if we want our constituents served, I'm tending to like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| And, again, I'm not tied to anything, but I just think we've lost something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| when we stop having someone down there that cares about Knox County and little else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6010)|
| 1:40:18| So the motion on the floor is to postpone one month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6018)|
| 1:40:21| and then Mr. Myers is going to get some information for us, contracts inside the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6021)|
| 1:40:26| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6026)|
| 1:40:28| There was a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6028)|
| 1:40:29| Yeah, I think there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6029)|
| 1:40:30| Go ahead, Jeff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| One question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| Next month we will take action on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| This will be done next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6033)|
| 1:40:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6034)|
| 1:40:36| Sir, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| I don't know if there is or there isn't, but it would help me if I had some specific examples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6038)|
| 1:40:43| of things that Knox County has missed out on because we did not have a lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6043)|
| 1:40:47| We had to chase a few bills last year that kind of almost cost us some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6047)|
| 1:40:51| And so we made a couple of trips down to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6051)|
| 1:40:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6053)|
| 1:40:54| So I'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6054)|
| 1:40:55| So we have a motion on the floor to put it off for next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6055)|
| 1:40:57| And it will be the final setting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6063)|
| 1:41:04| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| Ordinance 14-12-101, consideration of an ordinance of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6066)|
| 1:41:13| amending section 2-281 of the Knox County Code to add language relative to the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6073)|
| 1:41:18| Internal Auditor's Authority to initiate an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| Ordinance number 028101 adopted 9-2302, and ordinance 10-3104 adopted 4-2610.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6081)|
| 1:41:33| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6093)|
| 1:41:34| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6094)|
| 1:41:35| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| You've got to be quicker than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6101)|
| 1:41:42| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6102)|
| 1:41:43| Recognize me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6103)|
| 1:41:45| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6105)|
| 1:41:47| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6107)|
| 1:41:48| Oh, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6108)|
| 1:41:49| Just quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| This is the wording in this says that the chairman of the audit committee can stop the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6110)|
| 1:41:59| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6119)|
| 1:42:00| No, it says that the auditor can start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| The internal auditor can find something and inform the chairman of the audit committee that she's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6123)|
| 1:42:10| that something needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6130)|
| 1:42:11| He can initiate that audit without coming back to us constantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| I thought it also meant that he could stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| What did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6140)|
| 1:42:21| He has to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6141)|
| 1:42:22| He can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6142)|
| 1:42:23| He has to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6143)|
| 1:42:24| What this is is that the auditor finds something that they are pursuing, and they deem that it needs to have a full-blown audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6144)|
| 1:42:32| Right now, they don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| So they may need to have someone to come to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| So instead of having to call the entire audit committee to get a vote for them to go do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| or come before this body to get a vote for them to go do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6163)|
| 1:42:47| this body in its discussion said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6167)|
| 1:42:50| let's give the chairman of the audit committee the up or down vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| and inform the chairman of commission of the fact that this is being pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| So the second reading is that the auditor comes to that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6179)|
| 1:43:06| They seek final approval for the full-blown audit from the chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| That can be an up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| I just want to be known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6194)|
| 1:43:15| I'm uncomfortable with the chairman of the audit committee being able to tell the auditor, no, don't do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6195)|
| 1:43:22| And then you're waiting for a month until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6202)|
| 1:43:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| But they're waiting for an interview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| Now you're waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6207)|
| 1:43:28| You have no option now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6208)|
| 1:43:29| You're waiting until the next meeting the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| My point is it should be at least two people, not just one person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6211)|
| 1:43:43| Would that be a significant change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| Yeah, because then if it's two people, then one and one, then what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| I just figured I'd ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| It needs to be three to get a majority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6231)|
| 1:43:53| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6233)|
| 1:43:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6234)|
| 1:43:57| I'm not disagreeing with the need for two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| I believe that what I'm going to say is that there are two people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| One is the trusted employee of Knox County, an internal auditor who has to abide by the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6244)|
| 1:44:14| and regulations of whatever auditing accrediting organization that person may belong to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6254)|
| 1:44:23| So that is the first person that's saying it looks like we need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| The second person then being the chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| So in essence, really, there are two people involved right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| I know that's quibbling over the number, but it is not a unilateral movement of the internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6274)|
| 1:44:44| Question, does the chairman of the audit committee is always an external person of audit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6284)|
| 1:44:50| Or can it be a commissioner sitting on the audit committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| Wow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6293)|
| 1:44:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6294)|
| 1:44:56| We never do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| I wouldn't want to be that person to say, no, just hold off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6298)|
| 1:45:02| I mean, I just think it's a, to be right there on the edge and be able to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6302)|
| 1:45:09| There's a lot of, if you come back later and something blows up and you stopped it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6309)|
| 1:45:15| you're going to look very guilty of wanting to slow something down until people have a chance to cover it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6315)|
| 1:45:25| Not that they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| It's going to look that way, and people are going to make it into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| Commissioner Olmey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6331)|
| 1:45:33| Yeah, that was my concern, too, when I sat in on the audit committee once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6333)|
| 1:45:37| when we started discussing this, and I've even brought it up on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6337)|
| 1:45:43| And I don't think that person would ever stop something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6343)|
| 1:45:50| I just personally don't believe they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| They would get a backlash so bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6352)|
| 1:45:57| Now, it could happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6357)|
| 1:45:58| I mean, I just don't foresee it happening, and I agree with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6358)|
| 1:46:03| I don't think a commissioner would ever sit as chairman of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| I hope not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6367)|
| 1:46:09| That should be somebody with the knowledge of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6369)|
| 1:46:13| I mean, I'm fine with this, but I brought it up in the first reading that I would have felt comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| if it was both entities giving approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6380)|
| 1:46:25| But I'm fine with the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6385)|
| 1:46:27| And you're waiting two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6387)|
| 1:46:29| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6389)|
| 1:46:31| I think I would be more comfortable with the internal officer comes to the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6391)|
| 1:46:36| and informs them that they are starting an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6396)|
| 1:46:40| And then the audit commission votes on it, committee votes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6400)|
| 1:46:44| That way they are not stopping anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6404)|
| 1:46:46| but they are informing the audit chair, commission, person that an audit proceedings are taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| That way you're not stalling anything, but you're not killing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| What if you, Mr. Law Director, if you've got it pulled up, what if you change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| It may be a significant change that we need to make for the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6422)|
| 1:47:06| What if it says the county auditor has the authority to pursue the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6426)|
| 1:47:09| and shall immediately, instead of obtain approval, inform the chairman of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| and inform the chairman of the county commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6435)|
| 1:47:17| That way you can't stop the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6437)|
| 1:47:20| Well, the buck stops right here at this table either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| Whatever decision has been made there, this body can change anything that it wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6443)|
| 1:47:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6448)|
| 1:47:29| But I'm trying to make it to where the chairman of the, what Commissioner Thomas was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| the chairman of the audit committee can essentially stop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| But if the internal auditor was just to inform the chairman of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| and inform the chairman of the commission, there is no stopping it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| I cannot visualize our internal auditor starting one without notifying the chairman of the commission also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6466)|
| 1:47:52| That's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6472)|
| 1:47:53| That's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| But they're both in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6474)|
| 1:47:55| And so instead of seeking approval from the chairman of the audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6475)|
| 1:47:58| how about just inform the chairman of the audit committee and inform the chairman of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| I'm thinking that's going to be a significant change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| I agree, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6486)|
| 1:48:07| I think that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6487)|
| 1:48:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Commissioner Oldman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6490)|
| 1:48:12| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6492)|
| 1:48:13| The only thing I don't want to create is an inspector general out of our internal auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6493)|
| 1:48:19| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| I'm afraid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| They're still our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6505)|
| 1:48:27| I know I'm not saying that Andrea would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| but I'm just saying that somebody could make it very political and just start going after people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6509)|
| 1:48:33| We've never seen that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6513)|
| 1:48:35| No, we've never seen that before, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6521)|
| 1:48:42| I was going to look at where we were coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6522)|
| 1:48:46| We were coming from a point where the internal auditor was waiting on meetings of the audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6526)|
| 1:48:54| to a point today that was being proposed that the internal auditor can commence work right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| So the point where we were and the point where we thought we were going to be today were two completely different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6541)|
| 1:49:08| One means that we were trying to do away with the loss of the element of surprise, if you want to use that terminology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6548)|
| 1:49:16| And going from an audit had to be authorized in the past, meaning we had to have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6556)|
| 1:49:25| to today an audit can commence if there is a basis in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6565)|
| 1:49:34| And the audit committee chairperson being the one that is sort of the, yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6574)|
| 1:49:46| It's sort of like a check and balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6586)|
| 1:49:48| And I believe that satisfies Commissioner Oyenbee's concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| that we do not have someone who will just take the report off the hotline or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6594)|
| 1:50:05| and commence an investigation, excuse me, commence an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| because then the word investigation is the word that I had trouble with a couple of months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6610)|
| 1:50:15| in trying to write this paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6615)|
| 1:50:19| What we were moving from, what we had in place today takes time to get the wheels rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6619)|
| 1:50:27| And what we're trying to approve today gets an audit underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| at the acknowledgment of the fact that there needs to be an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6637)|
| 1:50:39| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6639)|
| 1:50:40| And I think our law director mentioned this, talked about this a lot, either a month or two ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| and that the thing we were trying to do was answer the mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6647)|
| 1:50:51| The issue early on was right now we could send our internal auditor in all kinds of directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6651)|
| 1:51:07| And lack of an approving process is hard to create an orderly process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6667)|
| 1:51:18| This is for Knox County, for her, in this case for Andrea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6678)|
| 1:51:22| You know, we're not impeding her from investigating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6682)|
| 1:51:27| What we're talking about is a full-blown audit process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| And so if we take away this approval, we may end up in that same state where we're jerking her around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6691)|
| 1:51:43| and there's no one there to say, hold on, you got five already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6703)|
| 1:51:48| Let's prioritize and make this six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| If six needs to be moved to the front, yes, I approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| It may not be a no, but it may be a not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6715)|
| 1:51:58| So I kind of like having this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6718)|
| 1:52:02| And we're also informing the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6722)|
| 1:52:06| So if the chair hears a no from the chair of the audit department, then that can be a conversation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6726)|
| 1:52:14| So it's not like we're just going to empower the chair of the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6734)|
| 1:52:19| Again, I understand the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| But someone has to have a boss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| And that boss, it may not be a no, but it may be a reshuffling, limited staff, maybe a hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6747)|
| 1:52:35| we're going to have to ask for more staff before we begin this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| So maybe this one goes outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6758)|
| 1:52:40| So, again, I'm comfortable with the words that are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6760)|
| 1:52:47| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6767)|
| 1:52:49| I'm just a little concerned that it's the job of this commission to conduct the audits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| and that with this wording we are giving the power to someone that's not an elected official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| the ability to do our duty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6780)|
| 1:53:04| As I said a while ago, if that be the case and this body feels like that it should be stopped, the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6784)|
| 1:53:12| We have full authority over the audit committee and the auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6792)|
| 1:53:18| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6798)|
| 1:53:19| I think the charter that we're working with, the commission has designated the power of internal auditing to the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6799)|
| 1:53:29| And the internal auditor works for the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6809)|
| 1:53:33| And that may be why our wording right now has gotten to the point that the internal auditor has to get the approval of the audit committee chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6813)|
| 1:53:44| And as Commissioner McKenzie has pointed out, and I didn't realize it until he pointed it out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| that the chair of commission is going to know the very same information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6828)|
| 1:53:53| And if there's something going on, then I fully expect the chair of commission to bring us to the bottom of whatever's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6833)|
| 1:54:06| So, in essence, I'm happy with the wording that we've got before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6846)|
| 1:54:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6853)|
| 1:54:14| We have a motion and a second to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| As is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| Second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6861)|
| 1:54:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| All those opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| One opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6865)|
| 1:54:27| Two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| Randy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6869)|

| 1:55:40| And the next item is a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| It's already been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| I realize that this is an amendment to the agenda so it would take a super majority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| approve the adding of a discussion of the fire coverage committee that met this past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| whenever we met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6960)|
| 1:56:01| Last Monday, we met last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| The fire protection committee met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6963)|
| 1:56:06| And I would move that we add to the agenda that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| You don't need a majority to vote on a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6971)|
| 1:56:15| The chair can put that in because there's not a vote to be taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6979)|
| 1:56:20| What brought attention to the discussion of fire protection was an article that was in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6980)|
| 1:56:27| the local paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6987)|
| 1:56:29| Officials discussed fire coverage, hydrants and unincorporated areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6989)|
| 1:56:35| The committee met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| It was basically a meet and greet and everyone decide whether or not the committee was maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=6998)|
| 1:56:47| complete and one of the points that was brought forward was the fact that we can have all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7007)|
| 1:56:52| of the fire engines or firefighters that we want on the street and maybe in front of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7012)|
| 1:57:00| business or residence to fight a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| But if there isn't any water there, fire hydrants, it may be difficult to put the fire out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7023)|
| 1:57:11| I believe that what we're going to do as a committee is add another person to represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7031)|
| 1:57:16| where does the water come from, which would be someone selected by those local water districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7036)|
| 1:57:26| if that is agreeable with the chair of commission because this is a chair appointed committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7046)|
| 1:57:34| to investigate fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7054)|
| 1:57:37| Then the other thing that came out of the fire protection meeting was we need to have a set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7057)|
| 1:57:44| of goals for that committee and that is the reason I want to bring this item for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7064)|
| 1:57:51| before us and hear the input of fellow commissioners about the fire protection committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7071)|
| 1:58:03| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| Well, I would think, I'm not on the committee, but if I were looking at a goal for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7085)|
| 1:58:10| fire protection, it would be that Knox County be protected, that we have fire protection over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7090)|
| 1:58:15| entire county, and that we have a centralized system to respond to a fire or an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7095)|
| 1:58:24| And I think that's the ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| How you get to that would probably may have goals of merging different areas of responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7107)|
| 1:58:33| that's out there now between, say, Carnes Volunteer, Real Metro, and growing some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7113)|
| 1:58:40| How do you pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7120)|
| 1:58:44| I mean, this has to be a very expensive project, I would imagine, and that would be a goal of paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7124)|
| 1:58:51| for it once you see what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7131)|
| 1:58:54| That's just some thoughts that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7138)|
| 1:59:00| I am on this committee and a lot of people don't realize Knox County doesn't own any water pipes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7140)|
| 1:59:08| They're owned by the First Utility District, West Knox Utility District, and so forth and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7148)|
| 1:59:13| And they all don't have the same pressure either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| I guess what I'm getting to is to get all of them to put fire hydrants across the county to satisfy what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7157)|
| 1:59:29| Commissioner Wright said, because you have to have water in order to put out the fires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7169)|
| 1:59:34| is a tremendous undertaking and expensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7174)|
| 1:59:39| And if there's a compromise, I think we need to find our – to define our goals in this committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7179)|
| 1:59:45| we need to find out what it's going to cost, first of all, before we can say, whoa, we're not even going to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7185)|
| 1:59:54| Because we're not going to sit here and raise taxes to equal amount, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7194)|
| 2:00:01| for fire protection without a lot of people in the county understanding they don't have fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7201)|
| 2:00:07| They live in the county for a particular reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7207)|
| 2:00:09| So we've got to understand we don't control the water and some of the utility districts have problems with their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7209)|
| 2:00:16| infrastructure as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| So that is one thing we're going to have to overcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7218)|
| 2:00:20| And we need to know where they have fire hydrants, who has them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7220)|
| 2:00:23| A lot of developers these days, when they make their developments in communities, they put fire hydrants in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7223)|
| 2:00:28| They make that part of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| Some of that's – you know, that makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7230)|
| 2:00:33| And a lot of people – we had somebody who spoke and he has one fire hydrant in his subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| He lives in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| But it's not enough water to put out a lot of fires and plus you have to be close enough to hook up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| So everybody needs to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| And also, I originally didn't know if maybe this committee would start with worrying about fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7247)|
| 2:00:54| for industrial parks and developments like that to start it off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7254)|
| 2:00:59| or is it more of a residential concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| So that would be my input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| And I started back in June looking at the ISO ratings of my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7269)|
| 2:01:16| and started working with rural metro who supplies the area with fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| And I got maps made up of where the fire hydrants were at and looked at the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7281)|
| 2:01:26| and what you're going to do with future developments for industrial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| I find all kinds of issues coming out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7290)|
| 2:01:32| You find that a lot of people, like the commercial businesses, don't pay for rural metro services out in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7292)|
| 2:01:41| The reason is they hope that they don't have an instance, but if they do have an instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7301)|
| 2:01:46| they will pay for it out of their pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| We've got to find a way of where the people want to fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| People out in my area don't want to pay any extra taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| But we do have fire hydrants available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| So in our area, I was trying to get the ISO rating throughout my district as low as it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7317)|
| 2:02:03| And we're not going to be able in my district to supply everybody with fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7323)|
| 2:02:09| The best we can do is get the ones that have the hydrants, that have the pipes in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| to supply them with protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7336)|
| 2:02:19| And then, hopefully, down the road, we can some way get the whole county under fire protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| But fire district is not the way to go in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| We're going to have to have a lot of areas that have successful fire departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7350)|
| 2:02:34| They have worked the community, and the community has decided what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7354)|
| 2:02:42| And some communities want fire protection, and some communities want it, but don't want to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7362)|
| 2:02:46| And if you don't want to pay for it, they're not going to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| So we're going to have to give it to the people that we have the pipes in place and who wants to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| I think one of the success programs that I've seen is this is out in North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7375)|
| 2:03:02| and what is that, the Choteau community, where a gentleman is building a shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7382)|
| 2:03:07| talked to the county, said, I'll build the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| You let me have a break on taxes, and the fire, and rural metro mans it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| I mean, that's in the type of an agreement that you could work with different developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7395)|
| 2:03:20| when they're building things around the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| Obviously, the folks out in Commissioner Wright's district, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| I would hate to think of the cost of putting in water pipes and fire hydrants out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7407)|

| 2:08:43| Scott Smith is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| And Mr. Dan McGehee, an attorney, would like to speak briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| He represents the Beals family, which owns this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7729)|
| 2:08:53| We're here tonight on a request for Mr. Mosley to rezone approximately 18 acres of property off Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7733)|
| 2:09:06| I think most of you all have either driven by or are familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7746)|
| 2:09:10| The property is south of Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7750)|
| 2:09:14| Moorfield runs from Westland Drive to Bluegrass Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7754)|
| 2:09:20| The property has been in the Beals family for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| Mr. Mosley requested rezoning for the property at 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| In the handout you have, this is an extract from the zoning report, MPC staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7771)|
| 2:09:39| there is a slope analysis that MPC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| And based upon the topography of the property, it could be zoned for planned residential at up to 3.78 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7783)|
| 2:09:53| The sector plan for this area is low density residential, which is one to five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7793)|
| 2:10:04| And this request is well within that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7804)|
| 2:10:09| The MPC slope protection says it could go up to 3.7 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7809)|
| 2:10:15| The area around here has been subject to a number of rezonings lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| And there is, in the second part of the packet, an area that shows the subject property, which is marked subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7821)|
| 2:10:29| with the densities that have been approved recently and in years gone by for the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7829)|
| 2:10:36| And the third sheet shows zoning information on recent zonings that have been approved in the area, immediate and all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7836)|
| 2:10:48| Now, several issues have been raised about the zoning at 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7848)|
| 2:10:55| The first one involves Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| And on the next page, you have a letter from Cindy Pianchi, who is the director of planning and development for Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7860)|
| 2:11:09| And the letter speaks for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| But she has examined the site distance for the road entrance into the subdivision and another entrance that accesses four lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7872)|
| 2:11:26| The site distance is required for 300 feet either way from the entrance to Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7886)|
| 2:11:34| Going towards Westland, the site distance is up to 545 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7894)|
| 2:11:41| South towards Bluegrass, it is 425 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| The entrance is 800 feet south of Westland Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7905)|
| 2:11:50| which, by the way, the Westland Drive-Moorfield entrance has been recently improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7910)|
| 2:11:56| Knox County spent a considerable sum of money improving that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7916)|
| 2:12:01| There's also an issue on the stream buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| Behind Ms. Pianchi's report is a chain of e-mails with Leola Camera, who is with Knox County Engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7924)|
| 2:12:17| who says the buffer on the stream that runs through the property is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7937)|
| 2:12:24| Then you go to some aerial photographs and a map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7944)|
| 2:12:30| This should be the last three pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7950)|
| 2:12:34| There is the stream that runs through the property is outlined in a yellow highlighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7954)|
| 2:12:42| It goes from upstream of this property under Pellissippi Parkway through an apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7962)|
| 2:12:51| and then enters a retention pond at Heritage Lake Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7971)|
| 2:12:57| At that point, there is an overflow valve there, and when that pond flows up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7977)|
| 2:13:03| it ultimately returns to the stream bed and goes into Fort Loudoun Lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7983)|
| 2:13:10| So this stream, TDEC and Knox County Engineering are fine with the protection of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7990)|
| 2:13:19| Now, in reviewing this subdivision, proposed subdivision, there's been a lot of discussion about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=7999)|
| 2:13:28| Mr. Mosley asked for 3.5 units per acre, and MPC approved that with one dissenting vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8008)|
| 2:13:38| He has looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8018)|
| 2:13:39| We have talked to Mr. Kline and Mr. Woodall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8019)|
| 2:13:42| Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach a resolution with them of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8022)|
| 2:13:48| However, in recalculating the number of lots and working on the concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8028)|
| 2:13:56| Mr. Mosley can bring the density to 3.2 units per acre, which would be 57 lots on the 18-plus acres in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8036)|
| 2:14:08| And we would ask that you all approve plan residential zoning, which I think everybody is in favor of, at 3.2 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8048)|
| 2:14:21| which is well within the sector plan you all have approved for low-density residential for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8061)|
| 2:14:27| I realize I'm about to run out of time or may have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8067)|
| 2:14:31| You went over. I'm keeping time, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| And that's what we would ask you all to approve today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| That would allow 57 homes in the subdivision, which is within 1,500 feet of Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8077)|
| 2:14:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8084)|
| 2:14:46| Mr. Chairman, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8086)|
| 2:14:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8087)|
| 2:14:49| Mr. Seymour just said that there was only one dissenting vote at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8089)|
| 2:14:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| On the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8095)|
| 2:14:56| On the zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8096)|
| 2:14:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| I think there was a zoning vote and a concept plan vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| But the concept plan vote, I mean, I think this needs to be brought out, too, only past 7 to 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8107)|
| 2:15:10| Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8114)|
| 2:15:17| Wayne Kline, 617 Main Street, Knoxville 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| We have provided a handout to each commissioner prior to today's hearing, both through your personal e-mails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8124)|
| 2:15:34| and through the secretary for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8134)|
| 2:15:38| And I'm here on behalf of every homeowner on Moorfield Road as well as the Westland West Homeowners Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8138)|
| 2:15:47| Commissioners, we've been working for 30 years trying to keep the density at a reasonable level out in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8147)|
| 2:15:56| And what Mr. Seymour didn't tell you is that although many of the subdivisions that you have in his packet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8156)|
| 2:16:05| have been zoned at 3.5 and perhaps even 3.6, the development, the way they're developed out has all, all of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8165)|
| 2:16:15| except two, been less than three and mostly at two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8175)|
| 2:16:21| Through our work, that's what we've been doing voluntarily for 30 years is working to keep the density low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8181)|
| 2:16:28| And what we're asking here today is for you to keep the density at no more than 2.4 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8188)|
| 2:16:37| And that would be 40 to 44 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8197)|
| 2:16:40| And so we went out, we have Mr. Mays here, and I want to introduce him so that he can speak on behalf of an engineering perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8200)|
| 2:16:48| rather than listening to a lawyer argue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8208)|
| 2:16:51| I want you to hear from an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8211)|
| 2:16:53| So, Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8213)|
| 2:16:55| Thanks, Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8215)|
| 2:16:57| My name is Sam Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8217)|
| 2:16:59| I live at 1405 Moorfield Road in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| I am a registered professional civil engineer in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| I'm also vice president of the American Society of Civil Engineers for the Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8229)|
| 2:17:14| And also I'm on the Knox County Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8234)|
| 2:17:18| So I am very much pro-development throughout my career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8238)|
| 2:17:23| I've worked in construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8243)|
| 2:17:24| I worked for Rogers Group for a number of years doing residential and industrial development, roadways, site grading, drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8244)|
| 2:17:33| Also, I've worked for 25 years within the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8253)|
| 2:17:36| I've done a lot with the Corps of Engineers and also with the DOE arena as far as designing landfills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8256)|
| 2:17:44| and caps and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8264)|
| 2:17:46| So I don't tell you that stuff like I'm bragging about anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| but I tell you that I have been around it and I do know a lot about this kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8269)|
| 2:17:54| And I'm not anti-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8274)|
| 2:17:56| I am pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8276)|
| 2:17:57| I wouldn't be on the Knox County Industrial Development Board if I wasn't pro-development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| So with all that, you know, I would like to go back to kind of what Mr. Kline said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8281)|
| 2:18:06| and I do believe there's a density that can be met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8286)|
| 2:18:09| and we can meet that with 2 to 2.4 units per acre instead of 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8289)|
| 2:18:16| I think, and I stated in some of the letters that I sent to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| I do not think that the conceptual design that was sent to you is realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| It is a conceptual design, so there has to be, you know, some thought put into some of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8306)|
| 2:18:31| And it does affect the density on some of these things that I'm going to show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8311)|
| 2:18:34| because you're trying to get things in there that are not built in the way that it's good for the environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8314)|
| 2:18:41| and good for the community and matches the surrounding community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8321)|
| 2:18:46| I think you gave four handouts, which I'd like to show you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8326)|
| 2:18:51| The first one, I don't know if we can get it on that screen or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8331)|
| 2:18:55| We got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8335)|
| 2:18:57| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8337)|
| 2:18:58| Yeah, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8338)|
| 2:18:59| On this first handout, you can see here the blue line stream is this coming right up through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| It's got the three dots coming right up through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8345)|
| 2:19:07| This is at the northern end of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8347)|
| 2:19:11| One of the guidelines for the NPDES is that all the water has to be captured in the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8351)|
| 2:19:19| and it has to be sent through a detention basin or some other device| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8359)|
| 2:19:22| so that it can be sampled before it's discharged off site into the blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8362)|
| 2:19:27| With the way that this topography lays out and the location that the detention pond is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8367)|
| 2:19:32| it's not a very good location in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8372)|
| 2:19:36| That was also stated in the Knox County engineer's report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8376)|
| 2:19:39| where they said they didn't know if that location would work or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8379)|
| 2:19:43| Normally, you put a detention pond at the lowest point in the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8383)|
| 2:19:47| You can see right up here, it's at the northeast corner of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8387)|
| 2:19:52| I just hand drew in a swell, a stormwater detention swell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8392)|
| 2:19:59| if you came from this part of the site up through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8399)|
| 2:20:03| If you start at the contours that they show it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8403)|
| 2:20:06| and then you get up to the detention pond in the northeast corner of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8406)|
| 2:20:10| you're at elevation 863.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8410)|
| 2:20:12| The top of the ground right now is at 868,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8412)|
| 2:20:14| so it's already five feet below the ground before it even gets there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8414)|
| 2:20:18| If you look at the blue line creek that's right there, it's at 864 right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8418)|
| 2:20:25| What's going to happen on that is this is a foot above the top of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8425)|
| 2:20:32| and you haven't even excavated out for the detention pond yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8432)|
| 2:20:36| What's going to happen is the water is going to flow into the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8436)|
| 2:20:39| back into the pond instead of from the pond into the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8439)|
| 2:20:42| The reason that all this matters is that this detention pond is usually located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8442)|
| 2:20:46| at the lowest point of the site so that you don't have to do extra grading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8446)|
| 2:20:50| and move more dirt around and disturb more dirt than you would normally have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8450)|
| 2:20:55| If you move the detention pond to the lower point of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8455)|
| 2:20:59| it would either be down along through here or possibly even along the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| to the sub-division right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| Then you get back into a thing where you're going to have to move the entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| to the sub-division and you get back into site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8470)|
| 2:21:13| Do you have the site distance or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| Again, when you go into engineering school, they say if you have enough time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8475)|
| 2:21:19| and you have enough money, you can do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| I'm sure if you have enough money, you can bring enough dirt in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8481)|
| 2:21:24| to put it up there at the top of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8484)|
| 2:21:26| but it wouldn't be my first preference of what I would be doing on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| Again, this all goes back to density because when you move that detention pond down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8490)|
| 2:21:34| then you change the number of lots that you can get in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8494)|
| 2:21:37| and then you're changing the density again and then you've approved it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8497)|
| 2:21:41| under false premises that are really not applicable on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| If you could go to the next slide that I have there, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8506)|
| 2:21:55| This is an overall plan view of the lots and the layout for the sub-division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8515)|
| 2:22:01| If you look at the blue part through here, that's where the blue line stream is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8521)|
| 2:22:05| There's also a sanitary sewer that runs through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8525)|
| 2:22:08| So that part of the site is really not applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| It's undevelopable right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8532)|
| 2:22:15| I have a hard time saying it, but hopefully you know what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8535)|
| 2:22:20| In my opinion, that should not be included in the area calculations for the overall site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8540)|
| 2:22:27| because what you're doing is if you can't put units in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| and you're putting them on the other parts of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| you're putting undue pressure on other parts of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8554)|
| 2:22:37| You're increasing the density on other parts of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8557)|
| 2:22:42| This other part right here, the red hash right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8562)|
| 2:22:45| that's parts of the site that, if I looked off the topography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8565)|
| 2:22:48| is 15% or greater on those parts of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8568)|
| 2:22:52| If you look in the Hillside Roadside Ridge Top Protection Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8572)|
| 2:22:58| it's on page 33 of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8578)|
| 2:23:02| For 15% to 25%, you require two dwellings per acre on that site maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8582)|
| 2:23:09| So what's happened, I think, in Knox County in the past is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8589)|
| 2:23:13| they've gone through here and averaged this overall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8593)|
| 2:23:16| the whole thing with the high density and the flatter area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8596)|
| 2:23:21| which would be right in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8601)|
| 2:23:23| and then they distributed that distribution over the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8603)|
| 2:23:26| when really what should happen is you should have two units per acre up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8606)|
| 2:23:31| and then whatever density you decide on down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8611)|
| 2:23:34| if you're really going to go in compliance with the HRPP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8614)|
| 2:23:38| So I think they've, so that you don't overbuild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8618)|
| 2:23:41| and so that you don't destroy the slopes and things in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8621)|
| 2:23:45| I've got a couple more real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8625)|
| 2:23:48| I know that I appreciate y'all's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8628)|
| 2:23:50| Before you leave that slide, can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8630)|
| 2:23:53| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8633)|
| 2:23:55| Can you say it back again, Joe Lee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8635)|
| 2:23:57| You got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8637)|
| 2:23:59| From looking at that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8639)|
| 2:24:03| all of the water from that property goes to the north and then east, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8643)|
| 2:24:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8651)|
| 2:24:12| All of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8652)|
| 2:24:14| Yeah, the property, there's a large watershed area up in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8654)|
| 2:24:20| to the south part of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8660)|
| 2:24:22| and you have a lot of drainage that comes down through this storm drain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8662)|
| 2:24:27| that goes down through here right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8667)|
| 2:24:30| and when you have major flood events that come down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8670)|
| 2:24:33| the water overtops the bank right through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8673)|
| 2:24:36| You can go down through there right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8676)|
| 2:24:38| and you can see where water level has been up in that drainage channel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8678)|
| 2:24:42| and how it can be a problem down through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8682)|
| 2:24:45| and if you want to come down through there through the winter or the snow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| or anything like that, Cedar Bluff Recreation Service will park at Wiggles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| and come there and pull about five or six cars out of that ditch every snow event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8692)|
| 2:24:58| But that's some more things I'm going to get into here in a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8698)|
| 2:25:01| with this overall design and conceptual design and how it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8701)|
| 2:25:05| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| Okay, if we could go to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8707)|
| 2:25:14| I did a hand sketch of the cross section at one of the stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8714)|
| 2:25:21| or one of the locations along the roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8721)|
| 2:25:25| and if you look at this, it's probably station 10 plus 00,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8725)|
| 2:25:30| and if you look at it, I'd really like to be able to see the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8730)|
| 2:25:34| if there's any way possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8734)|
| 2:25:40| Just a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8740)|
| 2:25:46| Yeah, I think I can describe it from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8746)|
| 2:25:49| If you look at it, if you cut a cross section along the roadway going up through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8749)|
| 2:25:54| and you look at here, there's a 26-foot wide roadway that they have in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8754)|
| 2:25:58| If you look at the topography, and I scaled this off of the conceptual design plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8758)|
| 2:26:03| there's about 200 feet between the top of slope on this side of the roadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8763)|
| 2:26:08| and the top of the slope on this side of the roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8768)|
| 2:26:11| The lot widths up there are 60 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8771)|
| 2:26:13| They're very, very narrow, and this is a place where there's supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8773)|
| 2:26:18| two units per acre, and there wasn't 3.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8778)|
| 2:26:24| If you look at this red line right here, that's the way nature intended it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8784)|
| 2:26:29| That's where it's created at a 15% to 20% slope going up through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8789)|
| 2:26:35| If you look at these side slopes over here, they're at 40% going up through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8795)|
| 2:26:41| so they're more than doubling what the side slopes are there right now going up that hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| and in addition, this one on this side is about 130 feet in length,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| and it's about 50 feet in vertical elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8814)|
| 2:26:59| So that presents a lot of problems because when you're doing erosion designs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8819)|
| 2:27:04| a lot of things that you take into account is the length of the slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| the pitch of the slope, how big it is and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8827)|
| 2:27:12| and when you get into a lot of those, you either have to bench off the slope and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8832)|
| 2:27:16| There's certain things you can do with materials and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8836)|
| 2:27:21| but at some point, the slope gets so long, and to prevent rilling and erosion along that slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8841)|
| 2:27:27| the longer it is, the worse it gets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8847)|
| 2:27:30| And then when you get down to the bottom of this slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8850)|
| 2:27:33| one of the stormwater criteria is that you have to keep the water separated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| Whatever's flowing from offsite to onsite has got to be separated from one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8858)|
| 2:27:43| and you've got to capture everything that's onsite and send it through the detention basin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8863)|
| 2:27:47| where you sample it or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| Well, in this case, that slope toes out right along Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8869)|
| 2:27:54| I think they put in there for a 25-foot variance from the side of the road to the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8874)|
| 2:27:59| Well, to try to be able to get those channels side by side with each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8879)|
| 2:28:07| coming down Moorfield Road and keep them separated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8887)|
| 2:28:11| everything's just too crowded on this site with the way it is right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| with the density the way it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8895)|
| 2:28:17| You've got other problems as far as one of the criteria in the HRPP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| is that clearance should not exceed 50% of the area in the slope group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8902)|
| 2:28:27| This is 100% cleared within this HRPP area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8907)|
| 2:28:31| so there's no area that hasn't been graded where they would be leaving trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8911)|
| 2:28:37| with the way this is designed with the way that it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| Setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8922)|
| 2:28:44| They have a zero setback line on one side and a five-foot on the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8924)|
| 2:28:48| There's no place for flexibility within these houses to change this design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8928)|
| 2:28:55| because the houses are so close together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| So you can just see from that how tight everything is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8940)|
| 2:29:04| And this is my final slide right here that I'd like to show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8944)|
| 2:29:12| On this right here, this is the intersection of where the road that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8952)|
| 2:29:18| for the subdivision interest comes into Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8958)|
| 2:29:21| This is a profile of that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8961)|
| 2:29:23| I got this off the conceptual design drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8963)|
| 2:29:26| This would be the center line, this blue right here, for Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8966)|
| 2:29:31| This is a vertical curve right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| You can see there's a couple of the roads, and I didn't even mention these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8976)|
| 2:29:39| but they've asked to exceed the 12% that's normal for the subdivision regs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8979)|
| 2:29:46| One of the roads is 15%. This one's 12.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8986)|
| 2:29:50| And when you get into it, they've also exceeded the normal vertical curve on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8990)|
| 2:29:55| It's normally 250 feet in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| They want this one at 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=8998)|
| 2:30:00| And what that does is that just compresses the curve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9000)|
| 2:30:03| and makes it steeper as it gets closer to Moorfield Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9003)|
| 2:30:08| It's steeper right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9008)|
| 2:30:09| And the problem that you have in that when you get in wet or wintry conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| is a car sliding out onto Moorfield Road when something's like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9014)|
| 2:30:19| You don't have an area flat that's between Moorfield Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9019)|
| 2:30:23| and the end of the subdivision road for it to stop in a good stopping distance and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| So, you know, I sent letters to each person, and I appreciate y'all's time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9030)|
| 2:30:35| but just, you know, these are just some of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| You know, you think of those slopes when you're driving up Moorfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9038)|
| 2:30:41| and they're 50 vertical feet to the first slope up in the air,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9041)|
| 2:30:46| and it's about 110 feet horizontal distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9046)|
| 2:30:50| Just trying to maintain those things through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9050)|
| 2:30:54| I just don't feel like it's the kind of subdivision that, you know, I would promote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9054)|
| 2:30:58| So, anyway, I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9058)|
| 2:31:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9060)|
| 2:31:01| If you have any questions for me or whatever, I'd be glad to come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomr267150126?start=9061)|
