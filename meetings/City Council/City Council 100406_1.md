| 2:35:18| we let them be defunded and become problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| I think scattered site is the way we need to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9321)|
| 2:35:24| because it builds in political buy-in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9324)|
| 2:35:27| to make the permanent supportive part of the housing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9327)|
| 2:35:30| So I think that's real important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9330)|
| 2:35:33| I don't support a single campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9333)|
| 2:35:36| I am, I think as a lot of you know, very conflicted about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9336)|
| 2:35:39| I would love to be supporting this, Mayor Haslam, I really would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9339)|
| 2:35:42| And the challenge I get is, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9342)|
| 2:35:45| in the words of Yogi Berra, it's déjà vu all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9345)|
| 2:35:48| It's the same kind of thing that we have been talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9348)|
| 2:35:51| since we had our first meeting at least four years ago about MinnVilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9351)|
| 2:35:54| And I get very frustrated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9354)|
| 2:35:57| We have talked consistently about scattered site housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9357)|
| 2:36:00| It says in the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9360)|
| 2:36:03| we need to involve every part of the community in this, and we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| We have sat back and we have concentrated these in the inner city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9366)|
| 2:36:09| We failed to move them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9369)|
| 2:36:12| We talk about transportation issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9372)|
| 2:36:15| There are ways to solve transit issues, and you and I have talked about these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| and nothing happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9378)|
| 2:36:21| I'm real concerned about the impact that the county is having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9381)|
| 2:36:24| as a result of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9384)|
| 2:36:27| I've had conversations with you about what's our strategy to do this differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9387)|
| 2:36:30| and I still haven't heard back from you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9390)|
| 2:36:33| I think it will cost money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9393)|
| 2:36:36| I think that, you know, Councilman Bailey did a nice job of saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9396)|
| 2:36:39| we are putting general fund money into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| And I think Ron Emery did a good job of saying, this is a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9402)|
| 2:36:45| I think we realistically need to say, yeah, we're going to have to spend money on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| And I don't see this administration being that willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| I want to support this, because I believe in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9412)|
| 2:36:57| I don't want to be here two years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| and I don't want to look back five years from now at a council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| and watch it on TV and have these same questions asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| So tell me, Mr. Mayor, what's going to be different now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9426)|
| 2:37:09| that's going to make this work the way we want to work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9429)|
| 2:37:12| I'll be glad to jump in here and answer, but my answer is going to be a little.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9432)|
| 2:37:15| I think just in the last two conversations we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9435)|
| 2:37:19| you see the difficulty, quite frankly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9439)|
| 2:37:22| Because, you know, everybody says, well, I think we should have a campus approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9442)|
| 2:37:27| Okay, well, where are we going to put that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9447)|
| 2:37:30| I mean, it's a real, I mean, I hear you, but A, it's not been proven it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9450)|
| 2:37:33| B, tell me where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| And one of the conversations we had initially was, we don't want to have a mission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9456)|
| 2:37:39| We made, the prior council made a definitive decision not to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9459)|
| 2:37:43| And that's how we ended up having the discussion we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9463)|
| 2:37:46| Would I like to see a greater participation by other parties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9466)|
| 2:37:50| You bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9470)|
| 2:37:53| But as you can see, everywhere that we've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9473)|
| 2:37:56| it ends up in this exact same battle we're having tonight, and it's very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| You know, maybe the fault's ours for not finding a location that everybody can agree on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9479)|
| 2:38:03| but quite frankly, if we could do that, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9483)|
| 2:38:06| And we would, you know, I would love to bring an easy one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9486)|
| 2:38:09| I would love to have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9489)|
| 2:38:12| But let me just make one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9492)|
| 2:38:15| I mean, we're doing this now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9495)|
| 2:38:18| We're serving the homeless now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9498)|
| 2:38:21| Everybody's saying, well, why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9501)|
| 2:38:24| We're going to attract those people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9504)|
| 2:38:27| We're doing it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9507)|
| 2:38:30| The question is, are we going to only do it through a sole method?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9510)|
| 2:38:33| Are we only going to do it through emergency shelters, which is what we're doing now as a city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9513)|
| 2:38:36| Or are we going to look at a different approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9516)|
| 2:38:39| You know, Ron brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9519)|
| 2:38:42| We've looked at this and have adopted permanent supportive housing as the approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9522)|
| 2:38:45| Is it a perfect approach? No, it's not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9525)|
| 2:38:48| But I think as you look at it and you look across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9528)|
| 2:38:51| more people have said this is what we want to try to do to make it work than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9531)|
| 2:38:56| The difference between doing what we're talking about and then just reverting to the status quo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9536)|
| 2:39:00| where we're taking care of homeless people, we're just doing it primarily through emergency shelter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9540)|
| 2:39:04| is this actually is more accountable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9544)|
| 2:39:07| People talk about, gosh, are we enabling here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9547)|
| 2:39:10| Is there more accountability built in here than what we're doing now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9550)|
| 2:39:13| It's also less expensive doing what we're doing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9553)|
| 2:39:16| The city of Knoxville is commitment long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9556)|
| 2:39:19| It's really no different financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9559)|
| 2:39:22| We're just coming up with something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9562)|
| 2:39:25| We're supporting an idea that I personally think is more effective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| more accountable and more cost efficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9568)|
| 2:39:31| And that's quite frankly why we end up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9571)|
| 2:39:34| It's hard. I mean, if this was easy, we wouldn't be having this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9574)|
| 2:39:37| I mean, we could add up all the hours we've talked at council and we'd have a whole lot of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9577)|
| 2:39:41| I would love to tell you there's an easy way to get consensus in buying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9581)|
| 2:39:44| but the very conversation we're having tonight shows how difficult that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9584)|
| 2:39:50| I probably didn't answer your question, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| I don't know how to describe it other than the way we really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9593)|
| 2:39:56| You know, if I could, because you made a statement here, and I want to read again, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9596)|
| 2:40:00| You made a statement here, and I want to read again, if I may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| By siting a facility closer to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9605)|
| 2:40:10| Closer to downtown from Farragut or from Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9610)|
| 2:40:14| I didn't say place it downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9614)|
| 2:40:17| I said closer to downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9617)|
| 2:40:20| And I'll put these, you know, my statements in the minutes for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9620)|
| 2:40:25| But I'm not saying we place it in a mission district downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9625)|
| 2:40:28| I'm saying closer to where, to the services on a bus line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9628)|
| 2:40:31| where there's an existing route, where it makes folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| we don't have to reach out with CAT and go places we don't normally go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9634)|
| 2:40:39| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9639)|
| 2:40:42| It's fair, and I just think, I'll just say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9642)|
| 2:40:45| finding that location is going to be really, really, really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9645)|
| 2:40:48| So, Joe, I see your light, but I've had a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9648)|
| 2:40:51| Well, you know, I think we should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9651)|
| 2:40:54| I don't think there's anything wrong with trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9654)|
| 2:40:57| and that more than likely is a five to four vote or a four to five vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| just like you had last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9660)|
| 2:41:03| And probably, you know, if you base it on what happened last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9663)|
| 2:41:06| the five votes that are sitting up here are going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9666)|
| 2:41:09| Or the four vote, four of the five votes are going to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9669)|
| 2:41:12| And then what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9672)|
| 2:41:15| And the ultimate goal is to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| But we've got to find a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| And we can hide behind, you know, we're all good Christian people and all this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| but we all have to face the political reality of what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| And it has to be sold to the people that we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9687)|
| 2:41:33| I'm going to go over here to Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9693)|
| 2:41:36| I don't know who is next, but I'll do that and then I'll come back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9696)|
| 2:41:39| Mr. Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9699)|
| 2:41:42| It's been interesting to me in the last couple of weeks in dealing with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9702)|
| 2:41:45| that it seems to me that one of the biggest issues we have is communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9705)|
| 2:41:48| And communication across the whole city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9708)|
| 2:41:51| It's not just necessarily South Knoxville or West Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9711)|
| 2:41:54| It's communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9714)|
| 2:41:57| It's interesting to me that, especially after being at the public meeting the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9717)|
| 2:42:00| that a number of folks came up and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9720)|
| 2:42:03| gosh, I didn't know about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9723)|
| 2:42:06| You know, I just learned about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9726)|
| 2:42:09| Now, we've been going on for this for five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9729)|
| 2:42:12| but for some reason there are, you know, until it happens in your own backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9732)|
| 2:42:15| you really don't know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9735)|
| 2:42:18| And I think that not only do I find that there's been a real lack of communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9738)|
| 2:42:21| about not only the issue, but about any kind of solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| There's been a situation, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9746)|
| 2:42:29| where because we don't have an overall plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9749)|
| 2:42:35| that, for instance, and when I talk about an overall plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9755)|
| 2:42:38| I'm talking about we have the city of Knoxville, we have the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| Where are we really talking about putting these particular facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9761)|
| 2:42:45| I talked to a number of people in South Knoxville when they talked about the Flinagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9765)|
| 2:42:49| and they said, well, you know what really is happening here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9769)|
| 2:42:52| is that everybody's picking on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9772)|
| 2:42:55| because there isn't a site selected in West Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9775)|
| 2:42:58| or North Knoxville or East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| Now, you know, as an architect, what we do is we look at a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9781)|
| 2:43:04| and we look at solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9784)|
| 2:43:07| And part of the solution is if we want the entire city to buy into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9787)|
| 2:43:10| we need to have an overall plan that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9790)|
| 2:43:14| this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9794)|
| 2:43:17| Now, I know I've talked to developers and they say, well, we can't do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9797)|
| 2:43:20| because the price of the land's going to go up and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9800)|
| 2:43:23| Well, I don't buy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9803)|
| 2:43:26| I think that what we need is we need an overall plan that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9806)|
| 2:43:29| if we're going to go with the facilities scattered throughout the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9809)|
| 2:43:32| we need to be able to identify those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9812)|
| 2:43:35| and we need to be able to say, yes, this is what is going to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9815)|
| 2:43:38| in the different parts of the city so that we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9818)|
| 2:43:41| I think as far as the communication goes, the folks that I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9821)|
| 2:43:44| and the folks that have emailed me and called me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9824)|
| 2:43:47| they're not against helping the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9827)|
| 2:43:50| or helping to find a solution to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9830)|
| 2:43:53| But what they feel very strongly about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| is the amount of money that's being spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| And there's not been a clear explanation about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| I mean, we can get into the details about this later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| depending on how late we want to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9845)|
| 2:44:08| In order to support the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9848)|
| 2:44:11| one of the ideas that I've thrown out is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9851)|
| 2:44:14| that because we're asking the citizens, in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9854)|
| 2:44:17| as politicians, to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9857)|
| 2:44:20| trust us, we know it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9860)|
| 2:44:23| It's that old thing about, well, it will work, trust us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9863)|
| 2:44:26| Yeah, we do know how much it's going to cost, but we can't tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9866)|
| 2:44:29| but we know it's this and this and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| One of the ideas that I had was, why don't we take Minvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9872)|
| 2:44:35| which is almost completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9875)|
| 2:44:38| It's for 57, Jenny, 57 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9878)|
| 2:44:41| Let's go ahead and use that as a test case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9881)|
| 2:44:44| Let's go ahead and take Minvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9884)|
| 2:44:47| fill it, have the case workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9887)|
| 2:44:50| run it for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9890)|
| 2:44:53| find out what our costs are going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9893)|
| 2:44:56| Meanwhile, during that year, we actually go with a real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9896)|
| 2:44:59| thought-out communication plan where we get the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9899)|
| 2:45:02| and all the neighborhoods to buy in while we're actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| seeing how this plan really works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9905)|
| 2:45:08| Maybe we are the first in the state or even the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9908)|
| 2:45:11| in order to have something like this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9911)|
| 2:45:14| I think that's a possibility that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9914)|
| 2:45:17| The big concern that I get from people is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9917)|
| 2:45:20| gosh, we're going to spend $14 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9920)|
| 2:45:23| on two projects for 105 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9923)|
| 2:45:26| Does that really make sense when you look at it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| I mean, that's $14 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9929)|
| 2:45:32| It's $7 million for Flinnegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9932)|
| 2:45:35| When people say, well, you know, it's federal monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9935)|
| 2:45:38| it's been earmarked, and this sort of thing, it's still our money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| We as council folks have been elected to a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9941)|
| 2:45:44| where we're supposed to be fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9944)|
| 2:45:47| for how we spend this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9947)|
| 2:45:50| To me, it doesn't matter whether it comes from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9950)|
| 2:45:53| the state government, or the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9953)|
| 2:45:57| And if it doesn't seem to be the right thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| or we don't have the right facts yet in order to spend that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| I think we have a good case where we could say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9963)|
| 2:46:06| well, could we use Minvilla, go ahead and see how it works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9966)|
| 2:46:09| and then kind of regroup and keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9969)|
| 2:46:12| I don't want to imply that I want to kill the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9972)|
| 2:46:15| I don't want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9975)|
| 2:46:18| And I think people that know me in terms of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9978)|
| 2:46:21| that we've done down at Emory Place and our location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9981)|
| 2:46:24| I think we can do what we can, just like Nick says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9984)|
| 2:46:27| to be a part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9987)|
| 2:46:30| But I do think we have some other possibilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9990)|
| 2:46:33| or other ways that we can look at it on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9993)|
| 2:46:36| And so I'm not sure that with where we're talking right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9996)|
| 2:46:39| and in terms of this particular level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=9999)|
| 2:46:42| that we need to go into any more details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10002)|
| 2:46:45| in some of the questions that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| But I don't know if I need to make a motion or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10008)|
| 2:46:51| but I would certainly like to see somehow that we move ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10011)|
| 2:46:54| with the idea that we use Minvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| as a real test and proving ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| put all our efforts into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10020)|
| 2:47:03| and see if that doesn't work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10023)|
| 2:47:06| before we start spending more money on additional places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10026)|
| 2:47:09| And I also want to throw out the fact that also most people know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10029)|
| 2:47:12| that if there's anyone involved in historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10032)|
| 2:47:15| and would like to see the Flinnegan School restored, it's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| But I'm not convinced that this is the right solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| even for the restoration of Flinnegan School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10042)|
| 2:47:25| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10045)|
| 2:47:28| If you're not comfortable making that motion, I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10048)|
| 2:47:31| I'll make the motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10051)|
| 2:47:39| delay this action for how long? A year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| I'd have to ask Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10063)|
| 2:47:46| I do have a couple of folks with lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10066)|
| 2:47:49| I'll let you make your motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10069)|
| 2:47:52| but I do want to just respect that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| But I don't want to cut you off there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| I'm done for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10078)|
| 2:48:01| Okay, good. I think Mr. Woodhull is next and I'm going to go back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10081)|
| 2:48:08| First off, I really appreciated your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10088)|
| 2:48:12| And it was very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10092)|
| 2:48:15| And I found myself, the political comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10095)|
| 2:48:19| I don't really quite get what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10099)|
| 2:48:22| I mean, if I'm off council, I'm still a citizen and I care about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10102)|
| 2:48:25| how things go in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10105)|
| 2:48:28| And also, you know, you're a Republican, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10108)|
| 2:48:32| Don't you buy into that part that at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10112)|
| 2:48:36| you have to make some judgments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10116)|
| 2:48:39| Because they voted you to make some judgments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| The people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| And so it's not just about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10125)|
| 2:48:48| you have to listen to what the people have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10128)|
| 2:48:53| And one of the reasons, and you don't just do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10133)|
| 2:48:56| what the last ten calls tell you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10136)|
| 2:48:59| But you're right in this sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10139)|
| 2:49:02| We have a serious communication problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10142)|
| 2:49:05| And frankly, one of the problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10145)|
| 2:49:09| the hugest problem is that we're actually not working our plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10149)|
| 2:49:12| and we haven't figured out a way to communicate our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| Because we've spent, even all of us on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10156)|
| 2:49:19| have spent all this time trying to figure out what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10159)|
| 2:49:23| From here, we're still trying to figure out what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10163)|
| 2:49:27| And that doesn't feel good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| That's not a good place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10170)|
| 2:49:33| If, in fact, we're going to do what I think we agreed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| and that is to embrace and deal with a very thorny problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10176)|
| 2:49:41| The people, we don't know how we got here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10181)|
| 2:49:45| We're not sure exactly what it is that we're implementing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10185)|
| 2:49:49| And we're not exactly sure what we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10189)|
| 2:49:53| How do you measure the outcome?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10193)|
| 2:49:57| I hate the idea of stopping something that I think is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10197)|
| 2:50:00| But it's not good if people don't know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10200)|
| 2:50:04| That doesn't sound very clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10204)|
| 2:50:08| But gosh, that's where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10208)|
| 2:50:11| I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10211)|
| 2:50:14| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10214)|
| 2:50:17| And Councilman Pavlis, I really appreciate your statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10217)|
| 2:50:21| And I know prior to your election, you were down in the well there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10221)|
| 2:50:24| speaking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10224)|
| 2:50:28| But in terms of the last council, Mayor, you alluded to the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| where we had the homeless coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10233)|
| 2:50:36| I think Councilman Woodhull was part of that, if my memory is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10236)|
| 2:50:41| And the coalition came to us and recommended the ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10241)|
| 2:50:45| as being the best solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10245)|
| 2:50:48| And the administration put an office in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10248)|
| 2:50:51| And Menvilla came forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| And we dealt with the issue there and with the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10254)|
| 2:50:58| We had two rounds of discussions on a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10258)|
| 2:51:02| and two rounds on Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10262)|
| 2:51:05| We lost the first developer, the low bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10265)|
| 2:51:08| And then we went and we had another low bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10268)|
| 2:51:11| And we had another round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| Two rounds of funding, which were passed and supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10274)|
| 2:51:18| We've had more workshops with Dr. Noe and experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10278)|
| 2:51:22| We've listened to studies. We've discussed other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10282)|
| 2:51:26| And then Flinnican became a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10286)|
| 2:51:31| And so we had discussions and workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| And we met with the public and we heard opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10295)|
| 2:51:39| And that was a zoning issue that we voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10299)|
| 2:51:42| And it passed, I guess, 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10302)|
| 2:51:45| I'll take Councilman Pavlis' recollection of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10305)|
| 2:51:49| It passed 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10309)|
| 2:51:53| And we decided then that that was an appropriate location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10313)|
| 2:51:56| for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10316)|
| 2:51:59| And now we have the funding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10319)|
| 2:52:03| And I'm no supporter of, I hate it when we talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10323)|
| 2:52:07| well, these are federal funds, these are pass-through funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10327)|
| 2:52:10| because that's our tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10330)|
| 2:52:13| But when I look at stimulus money and the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10333)|
| 2:52:16| that's been appropriated by the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10336)|
| 2:52:19| that we have in control of, if properly handled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10339)|
| 2:52:24| that we can work to help 48 new potential people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10344)|
| 2:52:30| who will be housed and to help them get out of the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10350)|
| 2:52:35| And, you know, we've got the funding issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10355)|
| 2:52:38| And it's pass-through money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10358)|
| 2:52:41| The rezoning issue's already been handled by a 5-4 vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10361)|
| 2:52:45| And I think that this 10-year plan is the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10365)|
| 2:52:50| And it isn't perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10370)|
| 2:52:54| We've discussed ways to improve the programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10374)|
| 2:52:57| We've found ways that the process can be improved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10377)|
| 2:53:01| But this is the best solution that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| And I've been consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10384)|
| 2:53:07| In the very beginning, I was on the complete opposite end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10387)|
| 2:53:10| of what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10390)|
| 2:53:13| And I think we really do have a moral obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10393)|
| 2:53:16| And as a whole community, I think we need to embrace this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10396)|
| 2:53:21| I'm not a fan of an east, west, north, south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10401)|
| 2:53:24| As a matter of fact, I asked Mr. Lawler today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10404)|
| 2:53:27| if he would put together some sort of a criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| and priorities process where we could geographically figure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| where these should go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| It's not easy, but I'm going to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| and I'm going to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| Let's see, I think Vice Mayor Becker, then Councilman Pavlos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| I guess, Councilman Greave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10425)|
| 2:53:48| you raised some interesting points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10428)|
| 2:53:51| And I guess just to share some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10431)|
| 2:53:54| I think Councilman Bailey started on some of the history of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10434)|
| 2:53:57| At some level, it's sort of interesting to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10437)|
| 2:54:00| well, let's take a year and come up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10440)|
| 2:54:03| Well, we did that, and we only did that five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10443)|
| 2:54:06| And the challenge becomes, if we spend a year coming up with a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10446)|
| 2:54:09| we're going to have new people come in who are not going to necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10449)|
| 2:54:12| buy into the plan, and we're going to spend another year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10452)|
| 2:54:15| coming up with a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| So I don't know that the process you've got is exactly it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10458)|
| 2:54:21| but you're hitting on a note of something that needs to do different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10461)|
| 2:54:24| I think Councilman Woodall summed it up really well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10464)|
| 2:54:27| that I think we have a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| We're not working the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10470)|
| 2:54:33| I'm not saying, yeah, don't misunderstand me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10473)|
| 2:54:36| that we don't have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10476)|
| 2:54:39| Well, let's try to just stick to the lights for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10479)|
| 2:54:42| I thought he asked me a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10482)|
| 2:54:45| You hit on something that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10485)|
| 2:54:48| you know, we're not communicating well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10488)|
| 2:54:51| I think Councilman Woodall hit it on, we're not working the plan well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| and we've got to figure out ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10494)|
| 2:54:57| I think some of the questions that Councilman Woodall asked Jenny about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10497)|
| 2:55:00| can we learn as we're doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10500)|
| 2:55:03| we need to figure out that we're not doing well at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10503)|
| 2:55:06| I think fundamentally that idea of let's postpone this for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10506)|
| 2:55:09| the Minvilla vote was really hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10509)|
| 2:55:12| and one of the things that I promised the folks at Minvilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| is theirs wouldn't be the only site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| and we would be moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| I'm frustrated that it's taken us this long to get to where we're at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10521)|
| 2:55:24| I don't want to go back and tell those folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10524)|
| 2:55:27| oh, there's another year until the next one's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10527)|
| 2:55:30| or a year after that something will happen, or two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10530)|
| 2:55:33| So I don't like the idea of let's postpone this for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10533)|
| 2:55:38| and figure out what to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10538)|
| 2:55:41| but I think we need to figure out what are better ways to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| And I'm not sure what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10544)|
| 2:55:47| But we need to figure out better ways to do the plan we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10547)|
| 2:55:50| Councilman Pavlis, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10550)|
| 2:55:53| I guess that just lends itself right to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10553)|
| 2:55:57| I mean, we're five years into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10557)|
| 2:56:00| and we still don't know what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10560)|
| 2:56:03| It's not being communicated properly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10563)|
| 2:56:06| and it's what I've said all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| It's just like any business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10569)|
| 2:56:12| You get it up and running, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10572)|
| 2:56:15| and then you stop and assess where you're at, tweak the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10575)|
| 2:56:18| and go down the right path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10578)|
| 2:56:21| And Councilman Woodhull, I mean, my whole point was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10581)|
| 2:56:24| and I'm not saying the ones that are going to be term-limited off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10584)|
| 2:56:27| are not carrying people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10587)|
| 2:56:30| I'm just saying that you don't know what you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| We're confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10593)|
| 2:56:36| I think it will be a very close vote tonight as it was the other night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10596)|
| 2:56:39| and you don't know what you're going to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10599)|
| 2:56:42| So if the ultimate plan is to make this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10602)|
| 2:56:45| and you guys got a short amount of time to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10605)|
| 2:56:48| what have we done, two or three in five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10608)|
| 2:56:51| We're going to do this same process 17 more times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10611)|
| 2:56:54| and I just don't think that this community can do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10614)|
| 2:57:00| I don't think that we can do this 17 more times and be successful at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10620)|
| 2:57:05| There will be too many hurt people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| people that will be mad that they're not going to buy in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10628)|
| 2:57:11| and I just don't see this moving forward as we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10631)|
| 2:57:15| I just really think if we're going to make this successful, a ten-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10635)|
| 2:57:22| then we've got to stop what we're doing, assess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10642)|
| 2:57:25| and look at other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10645)|
| 2:57:28| I know Jenny said that she doesn't think there's success models out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10648)|
| 2:57:31| but I would like to challenge that and see if there are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10651)|
| 2:57:34| and I will make a motion to postpone this for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10654)|
| 2:57:38| and if we have to create another task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10658)|
| 2:57:45| I know it's not going to be popular with you, Mayor, and I'm sorry for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10665)|
| 2:57:48| but I want to make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10668)|
| 2:57:51| Okay, there's a motion on the floor. Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10671)|
| 2:57:57| What's the motion again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10677)|
| 2:58:00| Nick, you want to make that one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10680)|
| 2:58:03| To postpone this action here for six months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| if there will, and get stakeholders at the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10686)|
| 2:58:13| and try to move this forward, rethink, just assess where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10693)|
| 2:58:20| Nick, is that proposal for all three resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10700)|
| 2:58:23| Okay, the proposal, like I said, is for three months to postpone all six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10703)|
| 2:58:28| Six months to postpone all three, excuse me, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10708)|
| 2:58:31| Is there a second to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10711)|
| 2:58:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10714)|
| 2:58:37| John, do you have a practical suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10717)|
| 2:58:40| Yeah, this is a practical, I think you need to understand the implication of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10720)|
| 2:58:43| The funding associated with Flinagan, several forms of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10723)|
| 2:58:47| have to be used in a time period that will say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10727)|
| 2:58:53| if you delay this six months, the funding goes away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10733)|
| 2:58:57| and the $6 million that developers put together to go towards Flinagan disappears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10737)|
| 2:59:01| and so you're back at zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10741)|
| 2:59:04| You can't just start again in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10744)|
| 2:59:07| You lose the funding that he's put together to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10747)|
| 2:59:10| So six months kills the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10750)|
| 2:59:13| Okay, there's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10753)|
| 2:59:16| I'm going to go to Councilman Della Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10756)|
| 2:59:19| I don't know who's late, but it's been the longest since I've been to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10759)|
| 2:59:22| so I'm going to come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10762)|
| 2:59:25| Well, I guess I'm confused now, because I wasn't speaking directly to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10765)|
| 2:59:28| I don't want to distract us, but I did hear enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10768)|
| 2:59:31| that I wanted to add two cents to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10771)|
| 2:59:34| and that was that I think several important points have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10774)|
| 2:59:39| One is that we do represent people that live in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10779)|
| 2:59:43| and are concerned about what happens there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10783)|
| 2:59:46| as well as to others in the community, whether they're homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10786)|
| 2:59:49| or have other unfortunate situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10789)|
| 2:59:52| And I've been hearing, did we do the best job in getting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| sort of sold at the grassroots level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10796)|
| 2:59:59| I guess I feel like we probably have two issues on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10799)|
| 3:00:02| One is, what do we do about Flinnican?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| And the other one is, what do we do about this overall program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10806)|
| 3:00:10| Can we drag ourselves through 10 or 12 or 15 of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| sort of beating ourselves and the communities up as we go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10814)|
| 3:00:18| I did want to suggest that something I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10818)|
| 3:00:21| might be something we could pursue on the second issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10821)|
| 3:00:24| and that is, since we use MPC and others to evaluate sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10824)|
| 3:00:29| for things like economic development and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10829)|
| 3:00:33| we could probably have some kind of a site survey map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10833)|
| 3:00:37| of potential sites and start holding meetings in communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10837)|
| 3:00:40| about the acceptability or not, or suggestions in general areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10840)|
| 3:00:45| as opposed to specific tracks, but that would be looking at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10845)|
| 3:00:49| so that we can find out where communities are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10849)|
| 3:00:53| and be doing that on some simultaneous track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10853)|
| 3:00:56| because otherwise they're going to come up as onesies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10856)|
| 3:01:00| and it's going to be the battleground, why me, why here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| why are you doing this to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10863)|
| 3:01:06| And I'm very sensitive in the fourth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10866)|
| 3:01:09| and I know that Mr. Brown must be in his district as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10869)|
| 3:01:12| and others here, that we're blessed in the fourth district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10872)|
| 3:01:15| with the mission district and everything else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10875)|
| 3:01:18| and I have people tell me at community meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10878)|
| 3:01:21| that I am chaining my furniture to the front porch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10881)|
| 3:01:27| so that it won't be stolen during the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10887)|
| 3:01:30| because someone's out on the prowl looking for a few bucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10890)|
| 3:01:33| to get a drink or a shoot-up or something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10893)|
| 3:01:36| and aggregating people who are just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10896)|
| 3:01:40| and I'm not saying this is the chronically homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10900)|
| 3:01:43| but people who are hanging around in our downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10903)|
| 3:01:46| or don't have jobs or don't have a life that they respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| on a full-time basis is kind of a source of mischief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10909)|
| 3:01:52| and it's a source of trouble for our police and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10912)|
| 3:01:55| So placing these people in homes makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| in the sense of can we get more stability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10918)|
| 3:02:02| than we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10922)|
| 3:02:05| The process we have must be flawed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| or we wouldn't be pulling these agonizing teeth as we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| and maybe we need to have a separate track being worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10931)|
| 3:02:15| where we get a master plan and we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10935)|
| 3:02:18| it's ten sites, we start identifying them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10938)|
| 3:02:21| and holding public meetings and picking the first ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| that work the best and moving on in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| I think we ought to go back to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10947)|
| 3:02:30| postpone this for six months or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10950)|
| 3:02:33| but I did want to say that because we are the people responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10953)|
| 3:02:36| for all the folks out there who can't be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10956)|
| 3:02:39| and I will tell you that I have people come to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10959)|
| 3:02:42| or call me or email me and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10962)|
| 3:02:45| we're going to do this, our home, our neighborhood, our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10965)|
| 3:02:48| is the most important thing we have in our life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10968)|
| 3:02:51| and we don't want you to destroy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10971)|
| 3:02:54| So if we're giving the impression that we're destroying neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10974)|
| 3:02:57| or communities, we're not doing our job if this is the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10977)|
| 3:03:00| we're going to solve the homeless issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10980)|
| 3:03:03| because that goes against the grain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10983)|
| 3:03:06| Those are the primary people who come together and make a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10986)|
| 3:03:09| and make a city and make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10989)|
| 3:03:12| So we have to be out there and maybe we need a study of potential sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10992)|
| 3:03:15| maybe we need public hearings or something as we go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10995)|
| 3:03:18| I'll shut up and let's get back to the Flint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=10998)|
| 3:03:21| There's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11001)|
| 3:03:24| Probably your comments should be to speak to the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| I'm going to go to Ms. Roddy and then I'll come to Mr. Greave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11007)|
| 3:03:30| Thank you, Mayor. I'm going to speak to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11010)|
| 3:03:33| I guess my first question, I'm not sure if it's for Ms. Weatherstone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11013)|
| 3:03:36| or Dr. Lyons or Mr. Lawler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11016)|
| 3:03:40| but it was stated earlier, I think, by Mr. Lawler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11020)|
| 3:03:43| that the goal of the 10-year plan is to place half of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11023)|
| 3:03:49| that we have identified through HMIS as chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11029)|
| 3:03:52| in existing housing stock and half in new housing stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11032)|
| 3:03:55| And I feel like what we are overlooking in this discussion tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11035)|
| 3:04:00| is that we have been placing folks in existing housing stock already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11040)|
| 3:04:05| very successfully, and in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11045)|
| 3:04:08| sometimes invisibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11048)|
| 3:04:11| And I wondered if one of the statements that was made tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11051)|
| 3:04:14| was that we need to step back from this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11054)|
| 3:04:17| that we need to let Minvilla play itself out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11057)|
| 3:04:20| and see if it's a success or not and move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11060)|
| 3:04:23| Well, I agree that we need to continue to measure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11063)|
| 3:04:27| or craft our future goals by evaluating our ongoing successes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11067)|
| 3:04:32| or lack of success or failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| However, I feel like what I've heard is that permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11076)|
| 3:04:41| has already been a success in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11081)|
| 3:04:44| Can somebody address that, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11084)|
| 3:04:47| Yeah, I mean, the reality is permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11087)|
| 3:04:50| I mean, we can talk all night whether or not the 10-year plan is working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11090)|
| 3:04:53| or whether we can talk about communication, whatever you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11093)|
| 3:04:56| The 10-year plan is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11096)|
| 3:04:59| We've put seven case managers in existing KCDC high-rise properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11099)|
| 3:05:03| They average 70 evictions per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11103)|
| 3:05:06| They've had zero evictions to the streets since we put those case managers there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11106)|
| 3:05:10| That's a huge difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11110)|
| 3:05:13| Those are at-risk population that would end up chronically homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11113)|
| 3:05:16| that have been successfully housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11116)|
| 3:05:19| We've put 318 into housing. 87% are still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| These are chronically homeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11122)|
| 3:05:25| That's not just the episodically homeless which we're also placing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11125)|
| 3:05:28| Permanent supportive housing works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11128)|
| 3:05:31| That's the wrong debate because it is working and we are successful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| and we have a good team that's making it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| Earlier, there was an experience offered for council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11137)|
| 3:05:42| where we could visit a permanent supportive housing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11142)|
| 3:05:45| I spent half a day or so at Pleasantry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11145)|
| 3:05:48| It was a facility, I believe, in Ms. Palmer's district that I didn't know existed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11148)|
| 3:05:53| It's very successful. I met with case managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11153)|
| 3:05:56| I met with residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11156)|
| 3:06:00| I met with the residents of the community that has been operating successfully for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11160)|
| 3:06:03| I know there are others. I don't know whether or not they can be named.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11163)|
| 3:06:06| There are others in the community outside of the KCDC system that are already working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11166)|
| 3:06:09| Is that correct, Mr. Welch?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11169)|
| 3:06:12| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11172)|
| 3:06:15| Helen Ross McNabb has 48 units right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11175)|
| 3:06:18| Positively Living has 28 units right next to Kansler Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| Never, you could talk to Mr. Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| but never do they get a complaint that their residents are bothering all the activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| that goes in the parks there because the residents are succeeding in housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11187)|
| 3:06:30| They live there. They have their own units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11190)|
| 3:06:33| They have their own life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| Where this exists, you don't know about it because it succeeds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11196)|
| 3:06:39| unlike other absent landlord properties, which are problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11199)|
| 3:06:42| This isn't that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11202)|
| 3:06:45| This is supervised affordable housing with support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11205)|
| 3:06:48| where people who used to not be able to succeed in housing succeed now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11211)|
| 3:06:54| As all of us have said tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11214)|
| 3:06:57| I respect the opinions and the passions of all of my colleagues around the table tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| This is a thorny issue, as Mr. Woodhull said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11220)|
| 3:07:03| I think because of the nature of this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11223)|
| 3:07:06| we've strayed away from the motions at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| which have to do with funding for Flanagan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11229)|
| 3:07:12| and we've gotten into a much broader discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11232)|
| 3:07:15| of the tenure plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11235)|
| 3:07:18| whether or not we've been successful in conveying the goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11238)|
| 3:07:22| and the purposes of that plan, the whys and wherefores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11242)|
| 3:07:25| of when the task force was formed five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| Have we done the PR job we should have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11248)|
| 3:07:31| I think we probably all agree, no, we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11251)|
| 3:07:34| But that's not what's before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11254)|
| 3:07:37| What's before us tonight is the opportunity for funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| for a new permanent supportive housing facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11260)|
| 3:07:43| to supplement the existing facilities that we have in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11263)|
| 3:07:46| that have already been successful up to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11266)|
| 3:07:50| I think I will not be supporting the postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11270)|
| 3:07:53| because this is a one-time opportunity at these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11273)|
| 3:07:58| particularly the neighborhood stabilization funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11278)|
| 3:08:01| that are part of the Recovery Act that are targeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11281)|
| 3:08:04| towards these kind of community development initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11284)|
| 3:08:07| And I feel like if this is a plan that we know is successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11287)|
| 3:08:13| if we feel like it's a better way to use our corporate resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11293)|
| 3:08:19| than what we're doing now, than the money we're spending now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| in our jails, for our police officers, our sheriffs, deputies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11302)|
| 3:08:26| in our hospitals, in our detox facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| if this is a better way to do it, then I just don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11310)|
| 3:08:33| how we can responsibly walk away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11313)|
| 3:08:36| As Councilman Bailey said, the four of us who were on council before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| went through some wrenching discussions with the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11320)|
| 3:08:43| to fund MinnVilla, not once but twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11323)|
| 3:08:47| And I think it's maybe easy for some of us to think of MinnVilla| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11327)|
| 3:08:51| as being just an extension of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11331)|
| 3:08:54| Well, it's really downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11334)|
| 3:08:57| Well, downtown is people's neighborhoods, but MinnVilla very much impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11337)|
| 3:09:00| Old North Knoxville and Fourth and Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11340)|
| 3:09:03| And the folks in that neighborhood were very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11343)|
| 3:09:06| because they were singled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11346)|
| 3:09:09| They felt like they were being singled out as being the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11349)|
| 3:09:12| And this administration and the council members that voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11352)|
| 3:09:15| for MinnVilla pledged that it may have been the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11355)|
| 3:09:18| but it wasn't going to be the last, that we were committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11358)|
| 3:09:21| to doing this better, to doing this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11361)|
| 3:09:24| And what that meant was facilities to take care of people's needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| in all parts of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| And I know we all wish we could wave a magic wand and have a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| north, south, east, and west, and then boom, it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| But the reality is that the site acquisition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| and the financial package for these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11379)|
| 3:09:43| are very complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| And the complexities require moving, marching forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| ponderously one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| So I cannot support this postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| I want to respond to Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| I'm not against the 10-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11398)|
| 3:10:01| And I don't like to use the word delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11401)|
| 3:10:04| And I respectfully disagree with Ms. Roddy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11404)|
| 3:10:08| from the standpoint that if we think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11408)|
| 3:10:11| it's taken five years to get one unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11411)|
| 3:10:14| five years to get one project really underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11414)|
| 3:10:19| We're talking about possibly getting the second project underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11419)|
| 3:10:22| I don't see that the process cannot continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11422)|
| 3:10:27| and move forward at the same time that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| and complete the one project and get it up and running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11432)|
| 3:10:36| convince the citizens that we are on the right track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11436)|
| 3:10:41| that this is the right plan, and that we then have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11441)|
| 3:10:45| the backup and the information to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11445)|
| 3:10:49| Now, the question I have is if we are placing people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11449)|
| 3:10:53| in supportive housing, can we place another 48| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| in supportive housing this coming year through KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11457)|
| 3:11:01| In other words, I'm not saying that we're going to stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| the supportive housing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| But what I'm saying, folks, is we've got a real problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11467)|
| 3:11:11| with convincing and getting the citizens behind this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| from what I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| And so all I'm asking in what I'm proposing is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11478)|
| 3:11:21| we move forward with the plan, but we already have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| a situation where we're almost ready to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| a particular project, so let's go ahead and get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| So that then when someone calls me and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11491)|
| 3:11:34| how much does it really cost? What is our success rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11494)|
| 3:11:38| Then we have those facts and figures in front of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11498)|
| 3:11:41| and we can say, yeah, look, the plan is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11501)|
| 3:11:44| So I can't see that one more year or however long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11504)|
| 3:11:47| it's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| The other question I'd have for Madeleine is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11510)|
| 3:11:53| can those monies that you have, can those be allocated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11513)|
| 3:11:56| to other things? I guess there's a certain date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11516)|
| 3:11:59| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11519)|
| 3:12:02| Well, the NSP funds, the 800,000, they have to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11522)|
| 3:12:05| under contract by the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11525)|
| 3:12:08| But can it be used for stabilization of vacant houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11528)|
| 3:12:11| in neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11531)|
| 3:12:14| Right. What would happen is if these funds are not used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11534)|
| 3:12:17| for Flinnican, then we would have to go through a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11537)|
| 3:12:20| They can be reallocated, but there's a process to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11540)|
| 3:12:23| of developing a new plan for them, having a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11543)|
| 3:12:26| comment period, I believe it's 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11546)|
| 3:12:32| Right. Remember, stabilization has very narrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| eligibility uses. So we would seek to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11555)|
| 3:12:38| another project that this would fit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11558)|
| 3:12:41| and go through the process and have it then committed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11561)|
| 3:12:44| by the end of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11564)|
| 3:12:47| Well, for instance, can they be used on facade grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11567)|
| 3:12:50| No, they can't. Give me an example of what they could be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11570)|
| 3:12:53| What we're using them now is for the purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11573)|
| 3:12:56| of foreclosed homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11576)|
| 3:12:59| You know, we have a couple of different nonprofit partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11579)|
| 3:13:02| that are doing that, which, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11582)|
| 3:13:05| surprisingly, given our market here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11585)|
| 3:13:08| it's a tough job to actually do because the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11588)|
| 3:13:11| is actually picking up a lot of the foreclosed homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11591)|
| 3:13:14| So it's a challenge for the nonprofits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| that we have that are working on it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11597)|
| 3:13:21| We also, to give you an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11601)|
| 3:13:26| it can be used for foreclosed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11606)|
| 3:13:29| abandoned or foreclosed properties, and some for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11609)|
| 3:13:32| redevelopment of residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11612)|
| 3:13:35| But it's all focused on residential and it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11615)|
| 3:13:38| basically low income people, low to moderate income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11618)|
| 3:13:43| So we do have the opportunity of having the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11623)|
| 3:13:46| I mean, we wouldn't necessarily lose it if we can find the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11626)|
| 3:13:49| But if we found another suitable project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11629)|
| 3:13:52| and could get it under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11632)|
| 3:13:55| Thank you. I think Vice Mayor Becker was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11635)|
| 3:13:58| A couple of things. Councilman Grieve, we have housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11638)|
| 3:14:01| as I said, 318 homeless folks have been housed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11641)|
| 3:14:04| and 284 of those are going to sleep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11644)|
| 3:14:07| in a permanent house tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11647)|
| 3:14:10| So I think there is a lot we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11650)|
| 3:14:13| It's not just been one project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11653)|
| 3:14:16| We're completing one on Moon Villa and we've housed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11656)|
| 3:14:19| I guess by my numbers, 250 people elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11659)|
| 3:14:22| The other thing, again, we have lots of permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11662)|
| 3:14:25| supportive housing that's been operating for a very long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11665)|
| 3:14:28| And it worries me that you keep saying you can't get any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11668)|
| 3:14:31| cost figures. I mean, Jenny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11671)|
| 3:14:34| Jackson Apartments have been going for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| I think you could have some cost numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| Positively Living has been going for four and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11680)|
| 3:14:43| We should have all these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11683)|
| 3:14:46| And I don't see what we get by delaying a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11686)|
| 3:14:49| And it worries me that you're not able to get the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11689)|
| 3:14:52| Because that says something really serious about our communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| Because it doesn't seem like that's that complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| And I don't know why it doesn't get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11698)|
| 3:15:01| And again, I'm constantly frustrated at these kind of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11701)|
| 3:15:04| Why something that seems like a fairly simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11704)|
| 3:15:07| piece of information isn't known by somebody who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11707)|
| 3:15:10| making a decision about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11710)|
| 3:15:13| So anyway, it's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11713)|
| 3:15:16| I don't know who was next. I'll go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11716)|
| 3:15:19| Councilman Roddy and then we'll go to Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11719)|
| 3:15:22| I don't know who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11722)|
| 3:15:25| Mr. Woodhull may have been before me, but with his permission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11725)|
| 3:15:28| this is a response to Mr. Graves' comments, respectfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11728)|
| 3:15:31| I think he talked about that we've only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11731)|
| 3:15:34| accomplished one unit and that's been Villa in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11734)|
| 3:15:37| I think what it's easy to lose sight of is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11737)|
| 3:15:40| the magnitude of this problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11740)|
| 3:15:43| that we started to embrace five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11743)|
| 3:15:46| And although housing first or permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| is the cornerstone of this plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11749)|
| 3:15:52| there are a lot of other tenets of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11752)|
| 3:15:55| I think I remember there's like nine core tenets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11755)|
| 3:15:58| And we had to start at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11758)|
| 3:16:01| We couldn't just dive right in the pond with these enormous projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11761)|
| 3:16:04| Things that we have accomplished are agency coordination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11764)|
| 3:16:07| If you all remember a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11767)|
| 3:16:10| everybody was trying to do the same thing and nobody was doing it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11770)|
| 3:16:13| And we've been able to bring the different agencies to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11773)|
| 3:16:16| and to allow each agency to specialize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11776)|
| 3:16:19| and take on a component of this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11779)|
| 3:16:22| that they do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11782)|
| 3:16:25| We have addressed homeless prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11785)|
| 3:16:28| We've talked several times about what CAC and KCDC is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11788)|
| 3:16:31| to address homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| We've talked about how we're going to be able to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11794)|
| 3:16:37| this information to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11797)|
| 3:16:40| So trying to stem it on the front end before it becomes a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11800)|
| 3:16:43| Finally, and this has been no small undertaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11803)|
| 3:16:46| has been the implementation of the HMIS system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11806)|
| 3:16:49| which is the Homelessness Management Information System,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11809)|
| 3:16:52| which is a computer database system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11812)|
| 3:16:55| where we're able to track folks and have more accountability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11815)|
| 3:16:58| and use some metrics to measure our success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11818)|
| 3:17:01| So I think in five years we have accomplished a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11821)|
| 3:17:04| Year one wasn't the year to take on a project like Minvilla or Flanagan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11824)|
| 3:17:07| You know, you march slowly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11827)|
| 3:17:10| and hopefully in ten years you can look back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11830)|
| 3:17:13| and you've made some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11833)|
| 3:17:16| Councilman Roddy was speaking to exactly what I wanted to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11836)|
| 3:17:19| and it took at least five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11839)|
| 3:17:22| to build the relational infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11842)|
| 3:17:26| to make supportive residential possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11846)|
| 3:17:29| Thank you. Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11849)|
| 3:17:32| Yes, I appreciate all the comments that have been made by my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11852)|
| 3:17:35| on this board and in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11855)|
| 3:17:38| but I think it would be wise at this point to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11858)|
| 3:17:41| and vote on these three resolutions, yay or nay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11861)|
| 3:17:46| and then I think we should take a small break and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11866)|
| 3:17:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11869)|
| 3:17:52| Talk about break from the plan or break for tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11872)|
| 3:17:58| We had just one quick...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11878)|
| 3:18:01| I know there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| There is a motion on the floor and I'm going to go ahead and go to the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11884)|
| 3:18:07| but Mr. Henry, if you'd like to say something real quick, you may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11887)|
| 3:18:10| I just want to make you aware of a meeting in the 70s just like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| when they emptied Lakeshore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11893)|
| 3:18:16| and they put them in Isabella Towers over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11896)|
| 3:18:19| Well, what the meeting was, they assured the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11899)|
| 3:18:22| that they had a number of caseworkers to take care of the patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11902)|
| 3:18:25| which calmed the citizens down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11905)|
| 3:18:28| Well, what happened over the years, through many budget cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11908)|
| 3:18:31| which will probably happen again, is they went to TV monitors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11911)|
| 3:18:34| and fired all the caseworkers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11914)|
| 3:18:37| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| Mr. Greer, if you want to say something, then we're going to go ahead and move toward the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| I want to say that what I've been concentrating on is the housing part of the ten-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| I'm not implying that the ten-year plan has not been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11927)|
| 3:18:50| I think the thing that the majority of my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| and the majority of the people that have talked to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11934)|
| 3:18:57| again, they don't fully understand the ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11937)|
| 3:19:00| and that may be part of their fault,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11940)|
| 3:19:03| but what I'm dealing with and talking about and what we're really talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11943)|
| 3:19:06| is funding for Flinnegan and we're talking about housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11946)|
| 3:19:09| and so by no means do I mean that the ten-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11949)|
| 3:19:12| has not been successful over the five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11952)|
| 3:19:15| What I am talking about is the housing part on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11955)|
| 3:19:18| I just want to make that clear. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11958)|
| 3:19:21| Okay, thanks. Okay, the motion on the floor is to postpone for six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11961)|
| 3:19:24| and that's the motion we're going to vote on right now and I'll ask Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11964)|
| 3:19:27| Well, the motion right now is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11967)|
| 3:19:30| Right now we're going to consider all three of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11970)|
| 3:19:33| If somebody would like to split them up, but I think for this purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11973)|
| 3:19:36| I think it's fair to consider all three of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11976)|
| 3:19:39| Vice Mayor Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| The motion is to postpone for six months and this would apply to all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11982)|
| 3:19:45| of the resolutions that are before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11985)|
| 3:19:48| I'm sorry. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| Vice Mayor Becker. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11991)|
| 3:19:54| Councilman Brown. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11994)|
| 3:19:57| Councilman Della Volpe. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=11997)|
| 3:20:00| Councilman Grieve. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12000)|
| 3:20:03| Councilman Palmer. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12003)|
| 3:20:06| Councilman Pavlis. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12006)|
| 3:20:09| Councilman Bradley. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12009)|
| 3:20:12| Okay, now there's not a motion on the floor at this present time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12012)|
| 3:20:15| so just, I mean, anybody's free to do whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12015)|
| 3:20:18| but right now there's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12018)|
| 3:20:21| Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12021)|
| 3:20:24| I'll move approval of items 11H through 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12024)|
| 3:20:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12027)|
| 3:20:30| Okay, discussion relative to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12030)|
| 3:20:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12033)|
| 3:20:36| We're going to go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12036)|
| 3:20:39| Ms. Mitchell, call the roll one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12039)|
| 3:20:42| And are we voting on all three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12042)|
| 3:20:45| Right now we're voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12045)|
| 3:20:48| Unless somebody would like to move differently, the motion was to approve all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12048)|
| 3:20:51| For purposes of understanding, there are three segments of funding for the same project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12051)|
| 3:20:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12054)|
| 3:20:57| The $800,000, the $250,000 and the $100,000 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12057)|
| 3:21:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12060)|
| 3:21:04| Okay, we're going to deal with all three of them together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12064)|
| 3:21:07| Okay, Ms. Mitchell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12067)|
| 3:21:10| Councilman Brown. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12070)|
| 3:21:13| Councilman Dela Volpe. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12073)|
| 3:21:16| Councilman Grieve. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12076)|
| 3:21:19| Councilman Palmer. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12079)|
| 3:21:22| Councilman Pavlis. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12082)|
| 3:21:25| Councilman Roddy. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| Councilman Woodhull. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| Okay, the motion passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12092)|
| 3:21:35| All three motions passed five to four then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12095)|
| 3:21:42| Let me just say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| I know that was a very difficult discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12105)|
| 3:21:48| Obviously everybody has their opinion, but I really want to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12108)|
| 3:21:51| I appreciate the views that everybody put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12111)|
| 3:21:54| This is a hard, hard issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12114)|
| 3:21:57| And some of the things about things we could do better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12117)|
| 3:22:00| well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12120)|
| 3:22:03| So this wasn't a good, you know, everybody's on one side is a good guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12123)|
| 3:22:06| and everybody's on the other side is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12126)|
| 3:22:08| This is a very difficult deal, and, you know, if it was easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12128)|
| 3:22:11| we wouldn't be having all these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12131)|
| 3:22:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12134)|
| 3:22:17| 12B is an ordinance to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| There was actually a suggestion for a break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12140)|
| 3:22:23| Okay, would folks like to take a break or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12143)|
| 3:22:26| The rest of the agenda I don't think has a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12146)|
| 3:22:29| Mr. Mayor, I want to thank you for tackling tough issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12149)|
| 3:22:32| The city needs a leader, and I appreciate you doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12152)|
| 3:22:35| And we can disagree on specific facts, but I think we all appreciate your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12155)|
| 3:22:39| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12159)|
| 3:22:42| I would suggest us trying to keep pressing forward, just if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12162)|
| 3:22:45| Is everybody okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| I think the issues before us, the rest of them should go fairly quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12171)|
| 3:22:54| Unless Mr. Brown has dancing and we could take a one-minute break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12174)|
| 3:22:58| All right, let's keep going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12178)|
| 3:23:15| Move approval. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12195)|
| 3:23:18| Discussion here? All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12198)|
| 3:23:21| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12201)|
| 3:23:27| I move to approve the first strip of right-of-way along the southwest side of North Central Street from East 5th Avenue to I-40| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12207)|
| 3:23:32| in authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owners, East Tennessee Automobile Club applicant, 6th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12212)|
| 3:23:39| Move to approve. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12219)|
| 3:23:42| If I may, I've got some amendments that I'd like to make on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12222)|
| 3:23:55| First off, I had all this right here in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12235)|
| 3:23:59| The first one is an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12239)|
| 3:24:00| Move to emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12240)|
| 3:24:01| For emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12241)|
| 3:24:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12245)|
| 3:24:06| Approve it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12246)|
| 3:24:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12251)|
| 3:24:12| Was there another one or just that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12252)|
| 3:24:14| There's three all told, if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12254)|
| 3:24:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12256)|
| 3:24:17| You need to do them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12257)|
| 3:24:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12258)|
| 3:24:19| That would be the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12263)|
| 3:24:24| I need a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12264)|
| 3:24:25| I need a motion to approve it on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12265)|
| 3:24:27| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12267)|
| 3:24:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12268)|
| 3:24:29| Vice Mayor, is your light for that or something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| No, but I'll have a light for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12271)|
| 3:24:32| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12272)|
| 3:24:34| This would be a good time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12274)|
| 3:24:35| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12275)|
| 3:24:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12276)|
| 3:24:37| I'm going to object to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| I think that emergency ordinances, you know, those of you who have been around know this, can short-circuit a discussion process that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12279)|
| 3:24:48| In this case, my light was on for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12288)|
| 3:24:51| I don't necessarily know much about this, but it actually worries me when our engineering department is willing to give up right away on a street that is a pretty major street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12291)|
| 3:25:01| And I didn't get a chance to talk about this, and I actually am very opposed to the emergency because I wanted to take some time between this and second reading to find out what the engineering department is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12301)|
| 3:25:12| Which number are we on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12312)|
| 3:25:13| We're on 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| That's not the one, Councilman Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12315)|
| 3:25:18| That's my fault then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12318)|
| 3:25:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12319)|
| 3:25:20| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12320)|
| 3:25:22| Do we need this one for emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12323)|
| 3:25:24| I didn't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12324)|
| 3:25:25| It's 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| I just found it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12326)|
| 3:25:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12327)|
| 3:25:28| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12328)|
| 3:25:29| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12329)|
| 3:25:30| So actually, I'll withdraw that motion for emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12330)|
| 3:25:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12332)|
| 3:25:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12333)|
| 3:25:34| So now we're back to, there is a representative of the East Tennessee Automobile Club here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12334)|
| 3:25:39| Mr. Becker, there is a representative of the Automobile Club here if you'd like to ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12339)|
| 3:25:43| Actually, it's not for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12343)|
| 3:25:44| I mean, it really is engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12344)|
| 3:25:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| Mr. King, would you like to address why we think this is okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12346)|
| 3:25:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| On this particular project, this is on Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12351)|
| 3:25:55| As you're aware, Mr. Wetzel was here earlier, but he's been involved in some work on Central, and we have looked at this section of Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12355)|
| 3:26:08| And this particular parcel had dedicated additional five feet of right-of-way that is wider than anything else along that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12368)|
| 3:26:16| And we've looked at the plan and what we will eventually do on Central, and that right-of-way isn't needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12376)|
| 3:26:22| AAA, in their improvements, needed this space in order to do the improvements that they're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12382)|
| 3:26:30| and they applied to close the right-of-way, and we have no objection because we don't need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12390)|
| 3:26:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12398)|
| 3:26:39| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12399)|
| 3:26:42| Mr. Pellis, is that for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12402)|
| 3:26:44| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12404)|

| 3:26:51| 12D is an ordinance to close a portion of Montavista Road from Buffett Road to the northeast terminus of Montavista Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12411)|

| 3:27:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12428)|
| 3:27:09| Any questions on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12429)|
| 3:27:10| There is someone to answer questions if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12430)|
| 3:27:13| Okay, ready to vote then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12433)|
| 3:27:14| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12434)|
| 3:27:15| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12435)|
| 3:27:16| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12436)|
| 3:27:17| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12437)|
| 3:27:18| 12E is an ordinance to close a portion of Chapel Chapelle Road subject to conditions from West Martin Mill Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12438)|
| 3:27:24| to the southwest corner of parcel 109PM022 and the northwest corner of 1233AB003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12444)|
| 3:27:31| and authorizing the mayor to execute quick claim deeds to the adjacent property owner's City of Knoxville applicant, 1st District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12451)|
| 3:27:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12457)|
| 3:27:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12458)|
| 3:27:39| Now we're going to go back to the emergency motion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12459)|
| 3:27:46| And I'm sorry, this is kind of the instructions that I have here, but it says the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12466)|
| 3:27:51| I think the question here is the easy funds that need to be spent before July 2nd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12471)|
| 3:27:56| and obviously this is going to move that process along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12476)|
| 3:28:00| and, you know, the two weeks is going to help the emergency to have to avoid the delay for two weeks anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12480)|
| 3:28:09| So that will be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12489)|
| 3:28:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12492)|
| 3:28:13| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12493)|
| 3:28:14| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12494)|
| 3:28:15| Yeah, actually what's interesting as well, I normally object to emergency ordinances because they do short circus a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12495)|
| 3:28:26| This has been a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12506)|
| 3:28:27| Closing this road has been something that's been talked about extensively at public meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12507)|
| 3:28:31| and I think getting forward, moving forward with it makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12511)|
| 3:28:34| So I think I will even be voting for this emergency ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12514)|
| 3:28:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12518)|

| 3:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12539)|
| 3:29:00| Right now we're voting on emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12540)|
| 3:29:01| Right now we're just voting on to make it an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12543)|

| 3:29:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12547)|
| 3:29:08| Mr. Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12548)|
| 3:29:09| I'm not done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12549)|
| 3:29:10| Now, I also want to amend it to where it will take effect immediately upon passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12550)|
| 3:29:14| That's emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12554)|
| 3:29:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12555)|
| 3:29:16| Wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12556)|
| 3:29:17| We've done that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12557)|

| 3:34:20| We'll change the description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12860)|
| 3:34:21| I'm the chair of the public and the agencies that are responsible for helping with doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12861)|
| 3:34:31| the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| The plan provides vision, direction, and priorities for engineering infrastructure capital projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12873)|
| 3:34:40| and maintenance, for education, for encouragement, for enforcement, and for tracking and evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12880)|
| 3:34:49| of the program as it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12889)|
| 3:34:52| We recognize the challenges that Knoxville has in implementing plans like this, but I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12892)|
| 3:35:02| like to give a little bit of a regional context of other communities that have been successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12902)|
| 3:35:08| For example, the League of American Bicyclists rates bicycle friendliness of communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12908)|
| 3:35:17| on sort of a bronze, silver, gold scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12917)|
| 3:35:22| Knoxville has not yet been recognized at the lowest level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12922)|
| 3:35:27| Chattanooga has attained bronze in spite of the fact that the state of Tennessee, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12927)|
| 3:35:34| those of you who might be interested in statewide politics, ranks 43rd of 50 states in policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12934)|
| 3:35:44| in support of bike friendliness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12944)|
| 3:35:47| Also, Auburn, Alabama, Oxford, Mississippi, Baton Rouge, Columbia, and Lexington all have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12947)|
| 3:35:55| bronze-level bike-friendly community recognition, and Gainesville has silver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12955)|
| 3:36:02| So if we want to compete in the SEC, we ought to at least go for bronze, and if we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12962)|
| 3:36:10| to beat Gainesville, we've got to go for gold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12970)|
| 3:36:14| So I'd like to thank Mayor and Council for your support in the past, and I look forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12974)|
| 3:36:19| to future progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12981)|
| 3:36:22| Jim, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12982)|
| 3:36:23| Anybody that knows Jim, he lives out what he just talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| So Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12985)|
| 3:36:26| Jim, I just wanted to be sure, what we're doing is really facilitating coordination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12986)|
| 3:36:32| of integrating bike safety, bike trails into roadways, into sidewalks, into other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12992)|
| 3:36:38| in the community, so that we have a safer, better way to bicycle and get around as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=12998)|
| 3:36:45| alternative to the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13005)|
| 3:36:46| Yes, that is certainly the goal of the whole program and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13006)|
| 3:36:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13011)|
| 3:36:52| Mr. Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13012)|
| 3:36:53| Yeah, I just want to say thank you very much for doing this, and by the way, if any of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13013)|
| 3:36:57| the Council members don't want their booklet, I'd like to have them to put at a particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13017)|
| 3:37:01| person's bike shop on that, so you're not going to take it home if I could have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13021)|
| 3:37:06| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13027)|
| 3:37:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13028)|
| 3:37:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13029)|
| 3:37:10| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13030)|
| 3:37:11| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13031)|
| 3:37:12| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13032)|
| 3:37:13| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13033)|
| 3:37:14| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13034)|
| 3:37:15| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13035)|
| 3:37:16| 12G is an ordinance to adopt the Knoxville one-year plan dated 2010 as prepared by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13036)|
| 3:37:18| Metropolitan Planning Commission for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13038)|
| 3:37:20| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13041)|
| 3:37:22| Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13042)|
| 3:37:23| I hate to be the one, but if we were to turn to the section of the book that has the, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13043)|
| 3:37:30| see, the north sector, I don't see clear page numbers, but you can take my word for it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13050)|
| 3:37:36| there's a north city sector annexation amendment 2F09RZ, which put general commercial on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13056)|
| 3:37:45| track that's on Murphy Road and Washington Pike, and I think that we should exclude| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13065)|
| 3:37:54| that from the acceptance of this so that the one-year plan doesn't now compete with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13074)|
| 3:37:59| sector plan we just dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| With that, I move its approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13083)|
| 3:38:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13084)|
| 3:38:05| I think he needs to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13085)|
| 3:38:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13086)|
| 3:38:07| Mark, do you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13087)|
| 3:38:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13088)|
| 3:38:09| I'll come back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13089)|
| 3:38:10| I was just going to say, let's talk about this next time, because it's only first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13093)|
| 3:38:14| Mr. Roddy suggests talking about it next time, since it's first reading and it's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13094)|
| 3:38:17| Mark, do you have something you can say real quick on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13097)|
| 3:38:20| Very quickly, currently, these two parcels have no plan designation, so because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13100)|
| 3:38:26| were annexed within the last year, we are assigning them their first designation, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13106)|
| 3:38:30| if you want to change the general commercial to neighborhood commercial, now is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13110)|
| 3:38:35| So we could just strike through that line where it says, from, to, and put to, neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13115)|
| 3:38:40| commercial, so that it's consistent with our earlier acts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13120)|
| 3:38:43| I move that we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13123)|
| 3:38:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13124)|
| 3:38:45| Just pen through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13125)|
| 3:38:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13126)|
| 3:38:47| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13129)|
| 3:38:50| Ms. Roddy, do you want to comment on that, or is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13130)|
| 3:38:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13132)|
| 3:38:53| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13133)|
| 3:38:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13134)|
| 3:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13135)|
| 3:38:56| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13136)|
| 3:38:57| Still no, or yes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13137)|
| 3:38:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13138)|
| 3:38:59| Well, what I was going to say is, with all that we had before us tonight, I have not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13139)|
| 3:39:02| had time to fully digest this document, and I know in past years I have found lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13142)|
| 3:39:06| things of interest and import, and I would suggest that everybody keep their copies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13146)|
| 3:39:10| because what I learned when I was a new council member is you don't get a new one on second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13150)|
| 3:39:13| reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13153)|
| 3:39:14| So keep it, and I hope that we will be able to allow some time to more fully discuss all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13154)|
| 3:39:22| that is contained herein the next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13162)|
| 3:39:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13165)|

| 3:41:44| Mr. Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13304)|
| 3:41:45| You want to call me Nick again tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13305)|
| 3:41:50| No, I just want to say, Mayor, that I think that all of us, we went through a pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13310)|
| 3:41:55| grueling experience, as you said, with the situation with Flinigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13315)|
| 3:42:00| And I want my colleagues to know that regardless of where they came from or how they voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13320)|
| 3:42:04| that I respect their opinions and I know they do likewise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13324)|
| 3:42:08| But I'd also like to say that I know in the last two weeks that I sent a number of questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13328)|
| 3:42:13| to Dr. Lyons and to Larry Martin and they were very gracious in getting those answers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13333)|
| 3:42:17| as well as John Lawler and others out there to help us try to form an opinion on what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13337)|
| 3:42:22| But I'd also like to stress that it's obvious even with the discussion of the several hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13342)|
| 3:42:27| that we went through this tonight as council people, not only new but old, that there is a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13347)|
| 3:42:32| of miscommunication out there and that somehow I think it would be good if not only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13352)|
| 3:42:37| and I'm not proposing workshops, folks, but I am saying to you, Mr. Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13357)|
| 3:42:43| that you've got nine council people here who I think are all committed to finding a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13363)|
| 3:42:48| to the homeless and that possibly what might be a good idea is for you to call us all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13368)|
| 3:42:53| and maybe we have a brain session or at least talk about where we now see weaknesses in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13373)|
| 3:43:00| And again, I by no means meant to imply that nothing has been successful in the last five years at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13380)|
| 3:43:05| But I do think that you've got nine folks here who really are serious and are really looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13385)|
| 3:43:11| for a solution and we're at your disposal. And I would hope that you would take a lot of the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13391)|
| 3:43:16| that were made tonight about communications, about leadership. Maybe the whole ten-year plan office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13396)|
| 3:43:21| needs to be looked at in terms of what has occurred in the last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13401)|
| 3:43:26| And it's so important that we engage the neighborhoods and the citizens in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13406)|
| 3:43:32| They are concerned. The ones that contacted me are concerned about the cost and are concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13412)|
| 3:43:37| about finding a solution. So I put that out and I know it's late and I appreciate you all listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13417)|
| 3:43:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13422)|
| 3:43:47| We all realize we can't have 20 more processes like this. I think all of us realize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13427)|
| 3:43:52| And it's incumbent upon us to make certain we find a different pathway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13432)|
| 3:43:57| Thank you all very much. We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil100406?start=13437)|
