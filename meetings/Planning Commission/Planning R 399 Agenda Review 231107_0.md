| 0:01:37| None of ours are working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Oh, no, they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| It just takes a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=99)|
| 0:01:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=100)|

| 0:01:51| I just have a couple updates to share with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=111)|
| 0:01:56| The mobility plan, which we update every four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=116)|
| 0:01:59| out of our transportation planning group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| is getting kicked off next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=121)|

| 0:02:11| We're going to have a survey, interactive map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| open soon as a way to give feedback early in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| So we'll be sharing that with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=136)|
| 0:02:19| Our consultants from Stantec will be in town next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=139)|
| 0:02:22| to help facilitate that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=142)|
| 0:02:23| So we're excited to get that underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| The growth policy coordinating committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| will meet on November 27 for the first of at least two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| public hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| There was an informational meeting held two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| And thank you for those of you who were able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=159)|
| 0:02:41| There are some resources related to the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=161)|
| 0:02:44| update available on the Advanced NOx website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| So I encourage you to take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| If you have any trouble finding it, just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=168)|
| 0:02:50| If you have any questions about the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=170)|
| 0:02:52| or would like more information, please reach out any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=172)|
| 0:02:56| That's all I have for today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| Can I go ahead and get to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| So we'll start off with Ms. Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=182)|
| 0:03:05| Item number 10, which is 11F23RZ, Keith Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| She's ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=191)|
| 0:03:14| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=194)|
| 0:03:16| So this request is for four parcels on Triggs Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=196)|
| 0:03:19| It's north of Brooks Avenue and just west of Williams Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=199)|
| 0:03:24| It comprises 0.62 acres in total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| The request is to rezone these parcels from RN2 to RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=208)|
| 0:03:32| general residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| and the HP overlay would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| As you can see, most of the surrounding residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=219)|
| 0:03:42| is zoned RN2 or RN1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| There is a city-owned natural area to the northeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| and that's a conservation area for the Williams Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=228)|
| 0:03:51| watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=231)|
| 0:03:53| To the northwest, there is a significant swath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| of RN6 zoning with multifamily development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| And then there's a little patch of orange here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| and that is from recent rezoning from RN2 to RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=245)|
| 0:04:11| as is being requested here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| And I believe townhouse development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=253)|
| 0:04:16| is being proposed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| The land-use classification in the Northwest County's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| I'm sorry, the land-use classification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| in the sector plan and the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=267)|
| 0:04:29| is traditional neighborhood residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=269)|
| 0:04:31| which permits consideration of RN1 through RN4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| And in the aerial, you can see that the predominant land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=276)|
| 0:04:39| use surrounding the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=279)|
| 0:04:40| is comprised of one or two units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=280)|
| 0:04:43| on lots among forested slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| The five points KCDC affordable housing community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| is located to the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=290)|
| 0:04:52| You can see the subject property is forested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| though historical aerials demonstrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=295)|
| 0:04:57| that much of this was previously disturbed at one point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| With the existing land use zoomed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| you can see that there is multifamily land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| use in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| This is in the form of duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=308)|
| 0:05:10| Although the neighborhood is mostly zoned RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| these duplexes conform more with the RN3 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| in terms of minimum lot size standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| and or the principal use standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| where you can have two duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| You have two duplexes here on single lots, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=325)|
| 0:05:28| is not permissible in RN2, but can be considered in RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| Staff are recommending RN3 zoning as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| to the requested RN4, because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| consistent with the sector plan and more compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=340)|
| 0:05:42| with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=342)|
| 0:05:43| As stated before, some of the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=343)|
| 0:05:45| residential development is already more in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| with RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| This is an area that will maintain safe walking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=350)|
| 0:05:53| access to transit after the reimagined CAP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| plan is implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=356)|
| 0:05:58| I'll show where.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| So this bus line will be redirected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| but this one will be maintained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| And it's about a quarter mile walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=369)|
| 0:06:13| from the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=373)|
| 0:06:15| You can also see that the Knoxville Botanical Gardens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| And discussions with Parks and Recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| indicate that an extension of the East Knox Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Trail is planned to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| And it will extend from Harriet Tubman Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| to the Botanical Gardens and down along Williams Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=390)|
| 0:06:35| So these are recreational and multimodal assets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| that do support capacity for more residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| At most, RN3 can permit up to eight townhouses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| if the lots were merged, but that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=409)|
| 0:06:51| would go through a special use review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=411)|
| 0:06:52| to evaluate its impact on the surrounding neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=412)|
| 0:06:57| Whereas the requested RN4 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=417)|
| 0:06:59| could permit up to eight townhouses or apartment units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=419)|
| 0:07:02| by right, and 13 through special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=422)|
| 0:07:06| So RN3 provides a more measured transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=426)|
| 0:07:08| whereas RN4 is fairly severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=428)|
| 0:07:10| And so for these reasons, we're recommending RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| I do have a question, Jessie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| So it's hard because you're behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| So is this, it's in the traditional neighborhood area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| I mean, with the city recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| or with the missing middle that's coming through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| is this one of the areas that is one of the neighborhoods that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| is inside that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| OK, so I guess the question would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| as that is moving forward, would it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| be any different if the overlay was already on it today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=470)|
| 0:07:54| Do you follow what I'm asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=474)|
| 0:07:56| In terms of the zoning district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| Yeah, or the missing middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| Yeah, if that was passed today, would your recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| be any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Would it allow more density versus the eight townhomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=485)|
| 0:08:09| that type of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=489)|
| 0:08:10| Yeah, since the amendments have not been adopted either by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| or recommended by this body, or adopted by city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| that wasn't part of the consideration here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=500)|
| 0:08:22| We were thinking about what exists currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| But yes, this area is TDR and would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| be incorporated into the missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=508)|
| 0:08:30| And there are certain housing forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| that are permitted in R and 3 that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| are not permitted in R and 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| So there's more density potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| Yeah, I guess I was just trying to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| because I know it allows townhomes in R and 3 and R| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| and 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=525)|
| 0:08:47| But would it, with the overlay of the missing middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| would it allow for more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| Even though it's not, I know it's not approved and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=535)|
| 0:08:57| adopted yet, but would it allow for more than eight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=537)|
| 0:09:01| I can research that based on the existing amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| and follow up with the scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=547)|
| 0:09:07| It was just more of a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=549)|
| 0:09:14| I've got one quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=554)|
| 0:09:18| Comparing R and 4 and R and 3 in the total square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=558)|
| 0:09:21| footage of the property, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=561)|
| 0:09:22| a difference in total number of units, townhomes possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=562)|
| 0:09:26| Or is it the same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| It would be up to eight townhomes in both districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| But one would be permitted by right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| and one would be through special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| And then in R and 4, there's a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=576)|
| 0:09:38| for up to 13 apartment units through special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| But the townhome count is the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=587)|
| 0:09:53| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| We'll move on to item number 19, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| is an ordinance amendment that had been postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| So I'll give a quick recap of the timeline for 8E-230A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=601)|
| 0:10:05| which is focused on the landscape article of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| So this was originally proposed in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| along with other amendments intended to better support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=612)|
| 0:10:15| middle housing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| There were two 30-day postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| and then a planning commissioner provided a revised ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| amendment proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=622)|
| 0:10:24| And the applicant substituted their original request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| with the new language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| Then there was another 30-day postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=629)|
| 0:10:31| to allow time for consideration of that revised language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| So the current amendment requests are as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=635)|
| 0:10:39| It adds criteria so that a landscape plan is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=639)|
| 0:10:42| required for multifamily and townhouse developments that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=642)|
| 0:10:45| disturb less than 10,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| unless it's required in another section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It removes the requirement to specify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| the species or names of plantings in a landscape plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| if it's in a residential lot that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| less than 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| However, a list of plants installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| would be maintained on site for inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| It allows a walking path to encroach into a landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| buffer yard by up to 30% in a class A yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| and 25% in a class B yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=674)|
| 0:11:17| This would only occur if there's no utilization of a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=677)|
| 0:11:21| in buffer yard width in any other section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=681)|
| 0:11:25| and if the walking path doesn't adjoin another impervious area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| It increases the permitted buffer yard reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| from 30% to 40% if the buffer yard incorporates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| a wall, solid fence, or a combination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| And it eliminates the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| for a class B buffer yard in a non-residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| when it abuts a residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| if the proposed development in that non-residential district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| is a residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| And there's no specification of the type of residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| And then it removes the requirement of a class A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| buffer yard for multifamily parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=723)|
| 0:12:06| abutting RN3, RN2, RN1, or EN districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| if the parking lot serves fewer than five dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| and a fence or solid wall is installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| Staff are recommending denying the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| The basis for this denial is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| did have a thorough missing middle housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=745)|
| 0:12:27| scan completed last year, one of the purposes of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=747)|
| 0:12:33| was to identify barriers to middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| And landscaping and buffer yards were not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=755)|
| 0:12:37| mentioned as an impediment to middle housing forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| But the core reason for recommending denial at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| stage is that there is a simultaneous ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| amendment process occurring that is focused on landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| The city tree board is tasked with researching and making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=771)|
| 0:12:54| recommendations on legislation related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| to forestry and vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| And the tree board is partnering with the East Tennessee chapter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| of the American Society of Landscape Architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| and other stakeholders to develop landscape amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=785)|
| 0:13:09| to the zoning ordinance that are in part stemming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| from recommendations in the Knoxville Urban Forest Master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=791)|

| 0:21:17| in the South County Sector Plan, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| does allow for the consideration of PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1279)|
| 0:21:22| in the planned growth areas of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1282)|
| 0:21:30| The existing land uses are mixed with various housing options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| and commercial properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| The property to the north was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| with single family residential homes beginning in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| The property to the south was developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| with single family residential homes in the 1960s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Considering the ongoing demand for a range of housing options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| the proposed rezoning from ag to PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| presents an opportunity to meet this demand where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| it can be consistent with surrounding development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1317)|
| 0:21:59| And again, our recommendation is approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1319)|
| 0:22:01| subject to the three conditions that I've already discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| And here is an example of the type B landscaping screening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1325)|
| 0:22:09| that would be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1329)|
| 0:22:14| And I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| I have a question, Naomi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1337)|
| 0:22:19| For the buffer, I know that the buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| is a buffer for the existing buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1343)|
| 0:22:26| for the buffer, I know that there is the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| because of that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| But is it possible for the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| to include keeping what is there currently as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| to taking it down and then putting stuff back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| If I recall correctly, and planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| feel free to pitch in if I'm speaking correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I believe that is part of the requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1373)|
| 0:22:56| of the Governor John Sevier study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1376)|
| 0:22:57| is to maintain those existing mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| We had one six months ago or nine months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| where they had to keep, it's like a John Sevier corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I knew that it is a requirement, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1396)|
| 0:23:18| didn't know that it was to keep the mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| I thought it was just to keep the buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| So it is the mature trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| I think it is, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| Is it 50 feet from the right-of-way line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1407)|
| 0:23:30| or 50 feet from the current road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1410)|
| 0:23:36| I believe it's from the right-of-way line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1416)|
| 0:23:47| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| Thank you, Naomi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| I'll turn over to Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| I'll be recusing from item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1436)|
| 0:24:07| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| Item number 12 is Middlebrook Grove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| This is in the Northwest City area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1451)|
| 0:24:16| off of Hamboldt and Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| The request is for 66 detached house lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| And this is a little bit unique in that they are asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| there's technically two different plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| attached to your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| One was 66 lots and one was 67 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| The 67 lot plan is really just as a reference for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| to know what their intention is if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| able to obtain zoning variances from the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1484)|
| 0:24:46| The plan that we, the main plan that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| looking at, the concept plan, is compliant with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1489)|
| 0:24:52| So that's the 66 lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| And then if they can get the variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| then the 67 lots could be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| and be consistent with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1501)|
| 0:25:05| I can show you where the extra lot will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1505)|
| 0:25:07| be if they do get variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1507)|
| 0:25:11| Background is pretty basic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| The property was rezoned from AG to RN2 in April 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1514)|
| 0:25:20| They are requesting two variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| to the subdivision regulations and intersection separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1522)|
| 0:25:27| variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| And I'll get more into detail here in just a second about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| And the other one is a tangent variance between two curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| It's called a broken back tangent curve or tangent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| It's really a straight section between two curves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1540)|
| 0:25:42| And because of the travel speed of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1542)|
| 0:25:45| it's really not a problem to reduce that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| There's either going to be two or three shared permanent access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| easements in the subdivision, highlighted in blue here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| And again, I'll get into that in a bit more detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| And there's going to be a boulevard entrance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| per the requirement of Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| Staff recommendation is to approve subject to conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1566)|
| 0:26:11| We're also recommending approval of the two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| And you'll see there's going to be different approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1573)|
| 0:26:15| language this month for subdivision variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So just kind of bear with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1578)|
| 0:26:20| There's a lot of language associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| If you look at the staff report, you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| see what all that entails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| If you have questions, feel free to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| I'll try to answer them as best I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1589)|
| 0:26:32| Just a quick overview on Ariel, the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| It's currently pretty well vegetated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1596)|
| 0:26:38| To the western edge is Hemboldt Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| Hemboldt is an arterial road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| connects basically through Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1603)|
| 0:26:48| It goes all the way down to Middlebrook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| and then goes up to close to Amherst,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1610)|
| 0:26:54| but I think it's Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I think I always get the roads mixed up just to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1616)|
| 0:27:02| Again, to the south is Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| So technically, the property does have frontage on Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| But really, for a true road connection for a subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| it's not ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1632)|
| 0:27:13| They don't have proper site distance at that access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1633)|
| 0:27:17| The only access opportunity is really up at Hemboldt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| for the entire subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1639)|
| 0:27:24| Mentioning the fire department standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| the City of Knoxville Fire Code requires two access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1647)|
| 0:27:31| if you have 30 lots or more or 30 units on a road segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| This has more than 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1656)|
| 0:27:37| It has 66 or 67 lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| In discussion with the fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| they felt that this design was acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| a median entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| And then with a traffic circle at the first intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| to help separate lanes of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| so if there was ever an issue at the entrance road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1672)|
| 0:27:55| hopefully the boulevard design would help get emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| vehicles in and out of the subdivision a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1679)|
| 0:28:04| If you look to the northeast side of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| there's the railroad tracks and old Amherst Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| that comes into the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| It looks like it kind of dead ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| and something that they could use as an access point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| but they really can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1698)|
| 0:28:19| It's really right away for the railroad, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| They just don't have the frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| to actually make that connection work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| I just want to point that out just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| in case you have a question about that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1709)|
| 0:28:36| So part of the issue with this request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1716)|
| 0:28:42| is what we call our shared permanent access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| option for access to lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Shared permanent access easement, what we call a spay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| can have up to five lots on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1731)|
| 0:28:54| It includes any lot that has frontage on a public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| that the access easement crosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| The driving surface and width for the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1741)|
| 0:29:06| is approved by engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1746)|
| 0:29:08| The easement has to be at least 25 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| And kind of a big thing with the city zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| is that this is not considered a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| You're not creating, other than legal access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| you're not really creating any frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| And the spay standards, though technically they apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| in the city of Knoxville, the zoning code standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| in the city don't really work well with the spay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1769)|
| 0:29:33| And I'll try to explain that here in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| So the city zoning code has four different lot types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| It has an interior lot, a corner lot, a through lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| which is kind of a double frontage lot, and a flag lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1782)|
| 0:29:46| And the spay, in this case, or the lots off the spays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| in this case, are more like flag lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1790)|
| 0:29:52| They're lots that are behind other lots with frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| And the front setback for a flag lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| is abutting the rear of the lot in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| So you can't have lots turn sideways to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1808)|
| 0:30:14| They have to all be facing the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1814)|
| 0:30:15| because your front lot line, your front setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1815)|
| 0:30:18| always face the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| And even if you're behind other lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| your front lot line has to face the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1821)|
| 0:30:23| So that's what you're seeing in these group of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| All the houses are facing the internal road, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| is over here, instead of turned sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| So this is, again, the one on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Unfortunately, it's kind of hard to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1837)|
| 0:30:39| if you're looking at a TV screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1839)|
| 0:30:42| But all the lots are facing a public road, even the one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| up here off the cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| If the variances are approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| their intent is to turn the lots facing the shared permanent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| So they're just kind of lined up as if this bay was a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| The only other difference would be in our 66-lot version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| The four lots along Francis, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1873)|
| 0:31:16| showing two lots actually facing and using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| this bay off the internal road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| And only two lots that come off of Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| And only two lots that come off of Francis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1887)|
| 0:31:29| And then if the variances are approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| the four lots here are coming off of Francis with this bay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| They should be able to do this bay in either version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| I'm not sure why they didn't in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| In the 66-lot version, they're showing six lots off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| of this bay, and they can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| They'll have to remove one of those lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| from that bay one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| So either go ahead and use this design on the 66-lot version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| or do something else that will help figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| But I don't have a concern with being able to get 66| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1924)|
| 0:32:09| lots one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1929)|
| 0:32:14| So the bigger question regarding the variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1934)|
| 0:32:19| is the intersection separation on Hemboldt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1939)|
| 0:32:25| So this is their entrance road to Hemboldt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| and then there's Creekhead Drive just to the north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| Typically, we want road access points to line up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| So ideally, their road would come in at the Creekhead Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| However, the problem is Creekhead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| doesn't have sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| That intersection point doesn't have the actual required sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| distance needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| So you're kind of working with two different problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1972)|
| 0:32:55| Either you line them up and have a sight distance problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1975)|
| 0:32:59| or you offset the intersections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| And at least the new road can get sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1981)|
| 0:33:03| And the preference at this point is to offset the intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| and get the sight distance that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| Typically, intersections on an arterial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| are required to have a 400-foot separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| They're asking for 190-feet separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=1999)|
| 0:33:26| And again, you're kind of working off of two evils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2006)|
| 0:33:29| Like, what's the lesser of two evils?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| And unfortunately here, we feel the separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| is more acceptable than having the lack of sight distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2014)|
| 0:33:42| And being located where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| So two issues that could come up is either you have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| intersection is too close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| You have people turning left, trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| to turn left into the subdivision or Creekhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| And then you have a queuing, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| the queue of people trying to turn back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| into the next intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| But we don't really feel like that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| to have a queuing problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2046)|
| 0:34:09| And being that the new road is on the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2049)|
| 0:34:13| of the existing Creekhead, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| not going to have people turning left out of the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| roads and then running into each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2060)|
| 0:34:23| Because if they turn left, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| going opposite directions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| Turn left out of road A, you're going south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| Turn left out of Creekhead, and you're going north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2070)|
| 0:34:34| If they were opposite, then they'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| basically be turning towards each other, which is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2076)|
| 0:34:39| the most ideal situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| So it's kind of what we're stuck with on the variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| front on the intersection separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2086)|
| 0:34:52| So I have a couple of images that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| show the road conditions from the different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| This is from looking at road A from Street View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| Again, this is looking at from Creekhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| We can look at them if you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| but I have them in here just as reference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| If anybody has any questions, I'll be happy to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2120)|
| 0:35:21| We can move on to item number 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2121)|
| 0:35:30| So this request is to remove the condition of a previous concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2130)|
| 0:35:37| plan approval of extending Parasol Lane to Autumn Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2137)|
| 0:35:43| Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| Basically, what's happening is the rest of the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| is being built out in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| The creek, Autumn Creek Drive, the highlands at Clear Spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| And they just need to get this resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| What happened is in 2005, there was two subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| having to be on the exact same planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2166)|

| 0:36:11| And they saw the opportunity to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| a connection between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| The subdivision on the right built its roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| platted just before the subdivision on the left did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| When the subdivision on the left would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| come to realize the right-of-ways were offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| they weren't actually lined up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| The properties on the other side of that future right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| got built now kind of in a pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| There's not really enough space to turn Parasol Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| to that future right-of-way, squeeze that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| through that little narrow section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| and make all the improvements that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| So more than likely, you would end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| impacting one or more properties by trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2214)|
| 0:36:58| to extend Parasol Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| City engineering, and also just to kind of complicate things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| even more, when the two subdivisions were approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2225)|
| 0:37:08| originally, they were both in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| The Autumn Creek Drive subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2230)|
| 0:37:13| the Highlands at Clearspring, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| now in the city, was annexed into the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2235)|
| 0:37:18| sometime after 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2239)|
| 0:37:20| It was like 2006, 2007, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| So we're working with both city engineering, county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| engineering, trying to deal with the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| But both of them come to agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2248)|
| 0:37:30| that it's not very likely that Parasol Lane can be extended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2250)|
| 0:37:35| And so staff is in agreement to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| the removal of the condition that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| would connect the two subdivisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2260)|
| 0:37:46| Just a quick question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Because they're offset from each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| and you may have said this and I didn't hear it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| but is there just not enough width for there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| to be a road going between there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I think it's 20 feet here, or somewhere close to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| But part of the problem is Parasol Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| is oriented this way already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| And then you've got to turn it really fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| And then so there's just a lot of geometry problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| that are happening there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| You could get a driving surface through there technically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| but everything from a design standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| would be complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2304)|
| 0:38:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2309)|
| 0:38:36| We can move on to the plan development, 11A23PD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2316)|
| 0:38:41| David Cockrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| OK, so in 2022, the Planning Commission and City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| approved a preliminary plan for this plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2328)|
| 0:38:52| Plan developments have two different steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2332)|
| 0:38:55| The first step is the preliminary plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| It outlines how they want to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And the big thing is exceptions to the underlying zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| district to allow their project to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| the way they want to make it happen without having to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| They're essentially not rezoning the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| but they are getting exceptions to the underlying zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2351)|
| 0:39:18| They have to outline the community benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| because that's part of the requirement of plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| development is that there's a community benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| If you're going to get something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| you've got to give something in return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| So here, the preliminary plan had three exceptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| One was to allow multifamily dwellings in the RM2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| Currently, the RM2 zone only allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| single family and duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| The second is to allow one dwelling unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| per 3,500 square feet of land area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2388)|
| 0:39:51| Essentially, that's the way the City of Knoxville Zoning Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2391)|
| 0:39:56| calculates number of dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| Multifamily dwelling units are permissible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| so they had to add that to the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| And the third was to remove or delete RM2 from Article 10.1.a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2404)|
| 0:40:10| which basically says that the RM2 zone and a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| other zones only allow one principal structure per lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2413)|
| 0:40:17| So by deleting this RM2 from this article section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| they can have three buildings on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| Otherwise, they would have to split the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2426)|
| 0:40:28| into three lots that each have one building each, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| doesn't really make sense for how this property will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| So the community benefits was the preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| of the historic Giffin School structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| which is on the right side of the screen here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| The second benefit was to provide workforce housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| And a third benefit was to provide a community gathering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2448)|
| 0:40:50| space made available to the neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| And the neighbor, or the community gathering space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| is going to be in the old structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| kind of in this back left-hand corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2459)|
| 0:41:04| And what I've highlighted here is the two new structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| that are to the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| So here's the existing structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| They intend to get historic tax credits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| so it will go through the National Park Service review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| There's also conservation easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2478)|
| 0:41:20| from Knox Heritage on the site, so the redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| or rehabilitation of the school should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| be done to National Park Service standards, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| are pretty high level, pretty high standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| So I haven't really concentrated too much on that structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| other than there will be living units in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| And that's where the community gathering space is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| The two new structures will be over to the left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| where there was play fields and such for the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| This gives you just a general idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2507)|
| 0:41:51| of what they're wanting to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| It's supposed to be, so there's the old historic school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| There's a mid-century modern addition to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| And these new structures are more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| aligned with the mid-century modern addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| to the school, which sits between, at most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| the oldest part of the school and the new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| This, everything that they're showing in the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| aligns with the preliminary plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| They had two new structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2544)|
| 0:42:26| They're rehabilitating the old school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| They're creating community gathering spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| And the project meets all the other zoning requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| of the RN2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| So staff is recommending approval of the final plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2557)|
| 0:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2564)|
| 0:42:52| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2572)|
| 0:42:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| We'll move on to item number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| You all have received a few comments about this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2584)|
| 0:43:06| Yes, number 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| This is in the Gettysview subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| The request is to amend the sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2591)|
| 0:43:12| plan from LDR, Low Density Residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2592)|
| 0:43:14| to MDRO, Medium Density Residential Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2594)|
| 0:43:19| and going from plan residential at three dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2599)|
| 0:43:23| per acre to plan residential up to 18 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| The staff recommendation is to not deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| both, basically, the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2611)|
| 0:43:34| because it's inconsistent with the surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| and does not meet the location criteria of medium density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2617)|
| 0:43:39| residential office, and the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| because it's inconsistent with the existing low density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| residential land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| So Gettysview is essentially this entire area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2628)|
| 0:43:53| around the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2633)|
| 0:43:54| So the green area is the golf course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| It also includes the clubhouse and the tennis courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| are technically on the proposed site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| So this is the zoning map, OS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2645)|
| 0:44:08| So anything you see in green, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| is kind of complicates it, just from a roof view standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2650)|
| 0:44:14| The green area is actually in the city limits of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2654)|
| 0:44:17| the city annex, the golf course, and the clubhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| I think it was at the request of the property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| so back in 1996 or 1997, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2664)|
| 0:44:34| This property includes the existing area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| where the tennis courts are, you can see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| So it's kind of an expansion of the residential area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Again, sector plan, designation, the entire subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| is low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| There's little pockets of higher intensity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| so this is your single family houses here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| with a few triplexes and fourplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| And then there's some attached houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| towards the entrance, closest to Ebenezer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| At one point in time, this little neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| commercial area was also part of the subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| but when it was annexed into the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| it got different zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| It was no longer planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| It was always intended to be commercial, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| This gives you a better idea of what the site looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| This rezoning request does include the tennis courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| which are owned by the country club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| The larger parcel is owned by Ron Watkins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| who is the original developer for Gettysview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| There's single family houses to the north and to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| And then the golf course is to the east and to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2744)|
| 0:45:50| A little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| So outside of just the rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| there was two different development plan approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2757)|
| 0:45:59| And this is for the area outside of the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| It does not include the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| In 1999, there was 90 condominium units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2764)|
| 0:46:08| approved in two three-story structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| with tuck-under parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| In 2003, they got approval for 19 condominium units, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| basically replaced that original approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2779)|
| 0:46:21| And then in 2020, they came back for a new request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| for the original 60 condominium units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| They ended up withdrawing that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| Basically, there's no changes in the vicinity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2793)|
| 0:46:40| that weren't amending the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2800)|
| 0:46:43| The neighborhood has developed pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| as intended over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| There's no rationale for basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| creating a pocket within the Gettysview neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| for higher intensity development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2818)|
| 0:47:03| Hey, Mike, can you give us a little background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2823)|
| 0:47:08| on the overall density and how we approved the 60 units back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2828)|
| 0:47:14| in 99 as it relates to the rest of the layout?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| Yeah, the original subdivision called this lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| Villa's Lots, or Villa's Property, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2842)|
| 0:47:28| So I guess it was in 1994, maybe, can't remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| maybe 95, when the original concept plan was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| So it was only a short time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| after where they requested the first 60 units on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2856)|
| 0:47:45| At the time that it was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2865)|
| 0:47:46| it was assumed to be appropriate for that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2866)|
| 0:47:54| At the three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2874)|
| 0:47:55| for the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2875)|
| 0:47:56| they're still not going over the density with the 60 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| Now, if you just look at that one site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| obviously it's much greater than three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| But for the entire planned residential property, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2884)|
| 0:48:10| In 2020, when they came back with a new application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| for the 60 units again, we felt that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| was appropriate for them to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Because there was an approval at one point in time for 60 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2899)|
| 0:48:24| they still were not exceeding the three dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2904)|
| 0:48:26| in the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| And it stuck to the original footprint of that request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2908)|
| 0:48:33| Here, they're expanding that footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| for those more intense uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| So that's where the rub comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2920)|
| 0:48:49| Just to follow up on that, too, just so I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| so you've really got two different landowners, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| You've got the original developer who had brought through a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| that was approved for 60 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| And then we have where the tennis courts are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| No, actually, so tennis courts were always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| planned as to be tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| Those were always tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| They had 60 units approved for the bigger property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| Then they decided to reduce that to 19 for that bigger property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2955)|
| 0:49:22| And then they never built them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2962)|
| 0:49:23| That was in 2003, I think, when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| did the plan for 19 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| They never got built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| So in 2020, they decided to come back to that 60-unit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| And since it was always shown as being villas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| and then was approved at one point in time for 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| we felt it was still appropriate at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Right, but now they're asking for 90, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| 90 units on the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| Well, that's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| If they get the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| their intent is to have a request for up to 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| But it just looked like, I guess, Synergy Golf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| I guess they own maybe the clubhouse and the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| And then you have the original developer with Mr. Watkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| Looks like, I guess, they're coming together just to try to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| the original concept of the 60 and just do it over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| Just trying to understand. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| Hey, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| There was a lot of discussion in the public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| about the covenants that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| Are those covenants still on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| And is that a consideration that planning staff gave when they-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| I have not seen the covenants personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| but it's typically not something that we would take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3038)|
| 0:50:41| for our review since they're private covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| If there was very strong evidence that there was an issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| then that's something we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3051)|
| 0:50:53| But really, we look at the zoning and what the land use plan says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| And if there's private covenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3057)|
| 0:50:59| then the private property owners can enforce that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3059)|
| 0:51:07| Can I ask one more question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3067)|
| 0:51:09| If they were to submit the 60 units as they did before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| in some sort of similar configuration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| would we be recommending approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| They- basically, what we said is they can still apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| or submit for 60 on the original footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| Whether it's the same plan or if it's different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3090)|
| 0:51:33| that we'll have to just look through that development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3093)|
| 0:51:37| as through the lens of today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| So, the original footprint is everything in blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| except the tennis courts, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3110)|
| 0:51:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| And how many is it approved for total right now on that whole area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| I'm sorry, what was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| How many is it approved for right now on that whole area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| Well, their most current approval in 2003 was for 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3124)|
| 0:52:10| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Yeah, because they basically replaced the 60 with a 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| So, if they wanted to go back to a 60,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3135)|
| 0:52:16| regardless, they would have to have a new development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| because it's been so long, it's no longer vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| For approval, they'd have to come back with a new approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3141)|
| 0:52:28| I feel like I'm just playing catch up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3148)|
| 0:52:29| but what they're asking for is to get rid of the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3149)|
| 0:52:35| Yeah, their proposal-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| this proposal extends, would extend their development area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| for- yeah, into the tennis court area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| And I haven't seen the whole file,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| but I think it might be a relocation of the tennis courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| They're not just doing away with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| I think they wanted to use that land for the buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3173)|
| 0:52:57| and then relocate and upgrade some of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3177)|
| 0:53:08| No other questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| I've got a couple of items I'd like to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3190)|
| 0:53:12| One is, if you'll put on your calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3192)|

| 0:53:32| 3131 Morris Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| And for those of you who are not able to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| we are going to try and make sure that it gets recorded as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| So we'll share that out with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| And then secondly, we have planned our Christmas party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3222)|
| 0:53:47| which will be scheduled December 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3227)|

| 0:53:58| And that'll run from 6 to 9.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| And I would also like to request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3240)|
| 0:54:07| we do this as commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| we do it for the planning department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| And we're thankful for their support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| And this is a good time to share that gratitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| And also, if I would request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| I am requesting that if you are willing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| each of you plan commissioners contribute $125| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3272)|
| 0:54:37| to help fund the party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| And if you would give that to Vice Chair Uten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| Not mandatory, but just a request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| A donation, a contribution of $125?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't say the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| It's where we had it last year and the year before at Maple Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| They have an event space behind Babalu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3306)|
| 0:55:11| So 6 to 9.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3311)|
| 0:55:13| Any other questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| I have a question for Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3316)|
| 0:55:19| I got your email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3319)|
| 0:55:20| I guess we all got your email about the planning Zoom meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3320)|
| 0:55:28| on the 15th, Tennessee planning, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| Can you kind of tell us what that's going to be about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| what they're going to go over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| So let me pull it up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Planning workshop, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| Or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3346)|
| 0:55:47| You're talking about the one I sent out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3347)|
| 0:55:48| Tennessee planning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3348)|
| 0:55:49| The one I sent this morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| Yeah, on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3352)|
| 0:55:52| So our colleagues in Middle Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3352)|
| 0:55:55| are kind enough to share with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| when they do these trainings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3357)|
| 0:55:59| and they usually do them Zoom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| and they send it out to all planning commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| and individuals who serve on Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| because there's training requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| And so that's why I shared it out with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3369)|
| 0:56:10| I'm going to try and do a better job of getting those out to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| Let me pull it up real quick, but I'm pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3374)|
| 0:56:15| there's going to be one on private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| There'll be an individual speaking to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| And there'll also be someone speaking to planning legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| What has come up recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| and what they're anticipating coming up in the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| For the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| For the state, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| And there should be an agenda attached to it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3395)|
| 0:56:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3398)|

| 0:56:48| If not, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| What form of payment can we give you, Vice Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3410)|
| 0:56:55| If you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| I mean, I just don't do Venmo because I'm old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3417)|
| 0:57:00| But if you want to give me cash or check,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| I'll turn it into the appropriate way to give to Chair Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| and make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-agenda-review-231107?start=3430)|
